  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let retArr = Array.from(urlMap.values(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse` is not called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is a necessary input for the function to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let retArr = Array.from(urlMap.values((<string>$.root()).entries().next().value[0]));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse` is not called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is a necessary input for the function to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let retArr = Array.from(urlMap.values($.root().children.values().next().value).entries();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse` is not called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is a necessary input for the function to work correctly.

DONE.
