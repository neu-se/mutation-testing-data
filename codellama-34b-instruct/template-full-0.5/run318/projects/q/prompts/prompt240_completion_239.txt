  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` would always be undefined, causing the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` would always be null, causing the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` would always be the string "foo", causing the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
