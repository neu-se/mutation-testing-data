  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `Delta` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new `Delta` object that contains all the operations of the original `Delta` object except for the last one, whereas the original code fragment returns a `Delta` object that contains all the operations of the original `Delta` object except for the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new `Delta` object that contains all the operations of the original `Delta` object except for the first one, whereas the original code fragment returns a `Delta` object that contains all the operations of the original `Delta` object except for the last one.
