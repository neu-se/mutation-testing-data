  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `tz.r` to the `current` array, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `tz.a` to the `current` array, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `tz.c` to the `current` array, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
