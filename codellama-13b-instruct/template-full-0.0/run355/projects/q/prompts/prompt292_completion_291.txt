  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment calls the `deferred.notify` method with the `progress` argument. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different argument, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with the `progress` argument, whereas the original code fragment calls the `deferred.notify` method with no arguments. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called with a different argument, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress, progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with two arguments, whereas the original code fragment
