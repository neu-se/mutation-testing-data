  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the message to the console with a higher level of priority, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Testing")
```
This would result in different behavior because the message "Testing" would be logged to the console, which could potentially cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Testing", "Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the message "Testing" would be logged to the console with a label of "Error", which could potentially cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this message.

DONE.
