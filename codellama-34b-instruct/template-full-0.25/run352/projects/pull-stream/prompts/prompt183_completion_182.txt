  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this new code fragment checks if `i` is strictly greater than `array.length`. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` for `i` values that are equal to `array.length`, while the original code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this new code fragment checks if `i` is less than `array.length`. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` for `i` values that are less than `array.length`, while the original code fragment would return `false` for those same `i` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % array.
