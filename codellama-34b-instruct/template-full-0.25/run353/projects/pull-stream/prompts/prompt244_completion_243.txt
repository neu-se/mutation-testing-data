  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function that takes two arguments, but `cb` is only one argument. This would cause an error when `_read` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(err, function(err) {
  cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function that takes two arguments, but the second argument is a function that takes one argument. This would cause an error when `_read` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(err, function(err, data) {
  cb(err, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function that takes two arguments, but the second argument is a function that takes two arguments. This would cause an error when `_read` is called.

DONE.
