  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `dispatch` method to return a value, but this fragment returns the string `'undefined'` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `dispatch` method to return a value, but this fragment returns `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dispatch'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `dispatch` method to return a value, but this fragment returns the string `'dispatch'` instead.

DONE.
