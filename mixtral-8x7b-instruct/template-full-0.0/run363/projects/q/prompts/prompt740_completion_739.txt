 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` always returns a resolved promise, while `Q.defer` creates a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected manually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy!') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error immediately, while `Q.defer` would wait for the promise to be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an object with empty `resolve` and `reject` functions, while `Q.defer` returns a deferred object with methods to resolve or reject the promise.

DONE.
