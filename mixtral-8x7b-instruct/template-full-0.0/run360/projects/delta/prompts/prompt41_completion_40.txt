 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a).reduce<AttributeMap>((attrs, key) => {
  if (a[key] !== b[key]) {
    attrs[key] = b[key] === undefined ? null : b[key];
  }
  return attrs;
}, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers keys from the first map (`a`) when checking for differences, while the original code considers keys from both maps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b).reduce<AttributeMap>((attrs, key) => {
  if (a[key] === undefined) {
    attrs[key] = b[key];
  }
  return attrs;
}, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers keys from the second map (`b`) when transforming attributes, while the original code considers keys from both maps with a priority for the second map.
