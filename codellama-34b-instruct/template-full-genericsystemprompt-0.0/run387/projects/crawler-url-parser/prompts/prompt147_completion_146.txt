  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 0
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is not being called on the same array as the `split` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 1
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is being called on a different array than the `split` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 2
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is being called on a different array than the `split` method.

DONE.
