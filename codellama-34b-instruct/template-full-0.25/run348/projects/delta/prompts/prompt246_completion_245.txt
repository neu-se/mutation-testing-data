  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are inverse operations, so replacing `delete` with `insert` would cause the delta to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are inverse operations, so replacing `delete` with `retain` would cause the delta to be inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that combines two deltas, whereas `delete` is a method that removes an operation from a delta.

DONE.
