  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is not being called on the `cbs` array, which would cause the `cb` function to not be added to the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is not being called on the `cbs` array, which would cause the `cb` function to not be removed from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method is not being called on the `cbs` array, which would cause the `cb` function to not be removed from the queue.

DONE.
