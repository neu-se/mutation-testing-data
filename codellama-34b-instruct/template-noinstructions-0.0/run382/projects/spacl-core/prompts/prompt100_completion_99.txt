  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `path` variable to lowercase before using it. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment removes the first character of the `path` variable before using it. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input, depending on whether the `path` variable starts with a certain character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the
