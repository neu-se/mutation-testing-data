  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `return Complex['NAN']` statement to be executed instead of the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement when the divisor is zero and the dividend is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `return Complex['NAN']` statement to be executed instead of the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement when the divisor is zero and the dividend is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] != 0 && this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `return Complex['NAN']` statement to be executed instead of the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement when the divisor is zero and the divid
