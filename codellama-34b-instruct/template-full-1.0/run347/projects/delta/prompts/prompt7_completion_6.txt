  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of the `attributes` object with the key `key`, instead of just returning the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of the `attributes` object with the key "key", instead of just returning the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes["key"] = attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of the `attributes` object with the key "key" to be the same as the value of the `attributes` object with the key `key`, instead of just returning the object.

DONE.
