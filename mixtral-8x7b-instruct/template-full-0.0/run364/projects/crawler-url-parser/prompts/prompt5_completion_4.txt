 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!currentUrlStr.match(/^(http|https):\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current URL starts with 'http://' or 'https://', which is different from the original `_has_illegal_chars` function that checks for invalid characters in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.length > 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current URL length is greater than 100, which is different from the original `_has_illegal_chars` function that checks for invalid characters in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof currentUrlStr !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current URL is a string, which is different from the original `_has_illegal_chars` function that checks for invalid characters in the string.
