  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would be replaced with the `Q.set` method, which has a different purpose and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would be replaced with the `Q.delete` method, which has a different purpose and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would be replaced with the `Q.post` method, which has a different purpose and behavior.

DONE.
