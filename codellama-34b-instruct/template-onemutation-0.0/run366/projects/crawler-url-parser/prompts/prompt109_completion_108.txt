  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseurl` property is not being used in the original code, and it would cause the `urlMap` to have a different key, which would affect the `urlMap.has()` and `urlMap.delete()` methods.
