  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `iter.next` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more values in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` returns the next value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.value` returns the current value of the iteration, whereas `iter.next` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

DONE.
