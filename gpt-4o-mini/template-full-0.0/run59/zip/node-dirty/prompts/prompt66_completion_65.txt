Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => { throw new Error('Write stream error'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces an error to be thrown when the write stream ends, which would not occur in the original code, potentially causing unhandled exceptions in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => { this.emit('write_close', 'Unexpected close'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'write_close' event with an additional message, which is not part of the original behavior, potentially leading to confusion in event handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => { this._writeStream = this._writeStream; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the write stream to itself, which is a no-op and does not properly clean up the stream, potentially leading to memory leaks or unexpected behavior in subsequent operations.

DONE.
