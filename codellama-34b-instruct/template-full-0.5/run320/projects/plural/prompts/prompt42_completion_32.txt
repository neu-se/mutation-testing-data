  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a different substring.

DONE.
