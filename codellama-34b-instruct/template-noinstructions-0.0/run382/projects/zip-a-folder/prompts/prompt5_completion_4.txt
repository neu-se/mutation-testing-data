  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if both `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` and `targetFilePath` are truthy, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` or `targetFilePath` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if both `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` and `targetFilePath` are truthy, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` or `targetFilePath` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
