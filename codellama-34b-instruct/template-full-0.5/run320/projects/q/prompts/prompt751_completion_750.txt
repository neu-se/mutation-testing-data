  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the rejection reason, instead of rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would send a progress notification with the rejection reason, instead of rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, and the error message would be different as well.

DONE.
