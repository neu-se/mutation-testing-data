  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one element, potentially skipping over important operations in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the entire length of the diff component, potentially skipping over important operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one element less than the entire length of the diff component, potentially leaving out important operations at the end of the delta.

DONE.
