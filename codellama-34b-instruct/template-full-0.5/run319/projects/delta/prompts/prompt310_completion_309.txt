  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [embedType]: handler.invert(opData, baseOpData) },
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the embed type and data, which could cause the transformation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [embedType]: handler.transform(opData, baseOpData, !priority) },
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the embed type and data using a different priority than the original code, which could cause the transformation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [embedType]: handler.transform(baseOpData, opData, priority) },
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the embed type and data using a different order of arguments than the original code, which could cause the transformation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
