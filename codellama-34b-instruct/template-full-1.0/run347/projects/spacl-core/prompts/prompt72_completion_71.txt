  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value than `ctx` alone, which would change the result of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property on `ctx` would return a different value than `ctx` alone, which would change the result of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.replace('-', '_')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would change the value of `ctx` to a new string with all occurrences of `-` replaced with `_`, which would change the result of the `query` method.

DONE.
