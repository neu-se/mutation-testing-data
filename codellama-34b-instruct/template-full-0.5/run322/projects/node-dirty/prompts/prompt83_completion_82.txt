  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.lastIndexOf` finds the last occurrence of a given string in a chunk, while `chunk.indexOf` finds the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of a given string in a chunk, while `chunk.includes` returns a boolean indicating whether a given string is present in a chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of a given string in a chunk, while `chunk.split` splits a chunk into an array of substrings based on a given separator.

DONE.
