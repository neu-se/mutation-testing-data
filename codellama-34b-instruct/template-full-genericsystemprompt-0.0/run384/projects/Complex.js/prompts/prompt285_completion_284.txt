  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional 1 would cause the result to be shifted by 1 unit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be swapped, causing the result to be different.

DONE.
