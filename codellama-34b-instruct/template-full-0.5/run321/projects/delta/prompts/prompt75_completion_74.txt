  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...newOp }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the properties of `newOp` instead of using the properties of `newOp` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...newOp, ...{ [Symbol.iterator]: null } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the properties of `newOp` and a `Symbol.iterator` property with a value of `null`, which would cause the `for...of` loop to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...newOp, ...{ [Symbol.iterator]: () => ({ next: () => ({ done: true }) }) } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the properties of `newOp` and a `Symbol.iterator` property that returns an object with a `next` method that always returns an object with a `done` property set
