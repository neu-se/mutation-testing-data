  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the nodeback function, while this code fragment passes a different error object with a different message.

DONE.
