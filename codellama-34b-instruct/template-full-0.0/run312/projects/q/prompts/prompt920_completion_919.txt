  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.resolve` to resolve the promise, while this new code fragment uses `deferred.reject` to reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use `deferred.notify`, while this new code fragment uses it to notify the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver` to create a node resolver, while this new code fragment uses it to create a node resolver with a different argument.

DONE.
