  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of strings, whereas `replace` returns a new string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns a portion of the original string, whereas `replace` returns a new string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.toLowerCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase` returns a new string with all characters converted to lowercase, whereas `replace` returns a new string with the specified replacement made.

DONE.
