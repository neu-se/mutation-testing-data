  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` character inside the character class negates the character class, making it match any character except `.` and `$`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b([.$])\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\b` word boundary assertion ensures that the `.` or `$` character is not part of a larger word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\W)([.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\W` character class matches any non-word character (i.e., any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore), and the second capturing group matches either `.` or `$`.

DONE.
