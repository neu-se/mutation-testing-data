  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method, which is a new `Delta` object, while this code fragment returns the `index` variable, which is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return other.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method, which is a new `Delta` object, while this code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method called on the `other` object, which is also a new `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method, which is a new `Delta` object, while this code fragment returns the result of the `chop` method called on the `this` object, which is also a
