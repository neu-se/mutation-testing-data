  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of its argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument. The `sin` function is used in the calculation of the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `cos` function is used in the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function returns the tangent of its argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of its argument. The `tan` function is used in the calculation of the latitude and longitude of the destination point, while the `cos` function is used in the calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns the arccosine of its argument, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of
