  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for write permissions instead of read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!src && fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the inverse of the `src` variable and read permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src ^ fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a bitwise XOR operation on `src` and read permissions, which would produce a different result than the original code.

DONE.
