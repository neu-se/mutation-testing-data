  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.handlers[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `handlers` object does not have a property with the key `embedType`, rather than checking if the `handler` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `handler` variable is not equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `handler` variable is not equal to `null`, rather than checking if it is falsy.

DONE.
