  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to the same type, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for both equality and type equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part !== pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while the new code checks for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.length === pageurl_without_last_part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality of the strings, while the new code checks for equality of the lengths of the strings.

DONE.
