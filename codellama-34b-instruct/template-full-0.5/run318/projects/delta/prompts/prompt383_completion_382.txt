  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of its two arguments, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index - length` would subtract the length from the index, whereas `Math.min` would return the smallest of the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index * length` would multiply the index by the length, whereas `Math.min` would return the smallest of the two values.

DONE.
