  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"
"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator in the original code is replaced with the identity operator, which would cause the stack trace to be joined with the separator expect when the function is called with a second argument that is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"
    at "
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator in the original code is replaced with the concatenation operator, which would cause the stack trace to be joined with multiple newline characters and the separator when the function is called with a second argument that is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator in the original code is replaced with the concatenation operator, which would cause the stack trace to be joined with two newline characters and the separator when the function is called with a second argument that is truthy.

DONE.
