  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method would return a value that is one less than the actual length of the operation, which could cause the iterator to skip over the last operation in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method would return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the operation, which could cause the iterator to include an extra operation in the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method would return a value that is twice the actual length of the operation, which could cause the iterator to include two copies of each operation in the list.

DONE.
