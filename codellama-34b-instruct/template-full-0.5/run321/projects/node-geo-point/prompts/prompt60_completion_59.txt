  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` would produce a different value than `sin(φ1)` for the same input, which would affect the calculation of `y` and `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a different constant than `φ1`, which would affect the calculation of `y` and `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is a different value than `φ1`, which would affect the calculation of `y` and `x`.

DONE.
