 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is an empty string instead of checking if it's a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof src !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is not a string, instead of checking if it's a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is not an array, instead of checking if it's a glob pattern. This might cause issues if the source is actually an array, but the code expects a string or a glob pattern.

DONE.
