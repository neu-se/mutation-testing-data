  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the `tokens` array, potentially missing a valid token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` before checking if it is less than the length of the `tokens` array, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by a larger amount than necessary, potentially skipping over valid tokens.

DONE.
