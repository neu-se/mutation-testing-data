 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer access the 'arg' property of the object 'a', but instead use the number 1, which would likely cause an error if 'a' is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer access the 'arg' property of the object 'a', but instead use a random number, which would likely cause an error if 'a' is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b
