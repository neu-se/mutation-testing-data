  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `otherOp.retain` object as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `thisOp.retain` object as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `otherOp.insert` object as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
