  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback if it is truthy, while this replacement calls the callback regardless of its truthiness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Callback called with error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with no arguments, while this replacement calls the callback with an error argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null, 'Callback called with data');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with no arguments, while this replacement calls the callback with two arguments.

DONE.
