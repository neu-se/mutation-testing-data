  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let str = '';
str += arr.shift;
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` returns a value, and `+=` concatenates strings, whereas `pop` does not return a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes and returns a portion of an array, whereas `shift` removes and returns the first element.

DONE.
