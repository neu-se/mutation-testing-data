  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `match` function to receive a concatenated string as the first parameter, which could potentially match a different set of paths than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split(ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `match` function to receive an array of strings as the first parameter, which could potentially match a different set of paths than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(ctx.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `match` function to receive a substring of the original path, starting at the index of the context length, which could potentially match a different set of paths than the original code.

DONE.
