  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```spec.match(/^\/$/) === null```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if the path starts and ends with a slash, while the original code fragment only checks if the path starts with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```spec.match(/^[0-9]/) === null```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if the path starts with a digit, while the original code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```spec.match(/^\//) === 0```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash at the beginning, while the original code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash anywhere in the string.

DONE.
