  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value !== value` always returns `false`, even if `value` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof value === "undefined"` would return `true` if `value` is `undefined`, even if it is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString() !== "object Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.toString()` would return a string representing the object, and `!== "object Promise"` would always return `false` if `value` is a promise.

DONE.
