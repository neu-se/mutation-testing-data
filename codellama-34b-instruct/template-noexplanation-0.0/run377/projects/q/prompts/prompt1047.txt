Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```

var Q = require("./q");

module.exports = Queue;
function Queue() {
    var ends = Q.defer();
    var closed = Q.defer();
    return {
        put: function (value) {
            var next = Q.defer();
            ends.resolve({
                head: value,
                tail: next.promise
            });
            ends.resolve = next.resolve;
        },
        get: function () {
            var result = ends.promise.get("head");
            ends.promise = ends.promise.get("tail");
            return result.fail(function (error) {
                closed.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>);
                throw error;
            });
        },
        closed: closed.promise,
        close: function (error) {
            error = error || new Error("Can't get value from closed queue");
            var end = {head: Q.reject(error)};
            end.tail = end;
            ends.resolve(end);
            return closed.promise;
        }
    };
}


```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
error
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
