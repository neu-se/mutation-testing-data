  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.toUpperCase()` is a string with all characters in uppercase. This change would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, which would be caught by the `try-catch` block and the error message would be modified to include the file name.

DONE.
