  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the code would be using the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the wrong value for `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using a different value for `b`.

DONE.
