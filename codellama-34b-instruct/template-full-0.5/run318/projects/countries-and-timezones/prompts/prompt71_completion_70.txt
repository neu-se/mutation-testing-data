  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name).split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the characters in the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first character of the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
