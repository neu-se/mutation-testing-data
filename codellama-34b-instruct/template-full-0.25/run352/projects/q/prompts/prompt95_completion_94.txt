  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++index` operator would be evaluated before the comparison, which would cause the loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would be evaluated before the comparison, which would cause the loop to terminate one iteration earlier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 2 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 2` operator would be evaluated before the comparison, which would cause the loop to terminate two iterations earlier.

DONE.
