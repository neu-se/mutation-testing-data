  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the object's type as a string, rather than the substring representation of the object's type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the object's constructor name, rather than the substring representation of the object's type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(obj instanceof Number) ? "number" : "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return "number" if the object is an instance of the Number constructor, or "object" otherwise. It would not return the substring representation of the object's type like the original code fragment.

DONE.
