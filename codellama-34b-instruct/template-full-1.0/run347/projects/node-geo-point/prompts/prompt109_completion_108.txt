  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<180 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be wrapped around the 180th meridian, which is not the desired behavior for a geographic coordinate system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Math.pow(2, zoom) * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be multiplied by a larger factor than necessary, resulting in an incorrect tile position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Math.pow(2, zoom - 1) * 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be multiplied by a smaller factor than necessary, resulting in an incorrect tile position.

DONE.
