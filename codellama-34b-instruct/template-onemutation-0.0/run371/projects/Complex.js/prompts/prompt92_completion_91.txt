  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was adding 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment is adding 0. This would cause the imaginary part of the resulting complex number to be different than the original code fragment.

DONE.
