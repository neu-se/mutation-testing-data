  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise. Using `rejected` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, whereas `fulfilled` and `rejected` are functions. Using `undefined` would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, whereas `fulfilled` and `rejected` are functions. Using `null` would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
