Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the next operation as an 'insert' type regardless of its actual type, potentially leading to incorrect index calculations when processing 'delete' operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the code to always consider the next operation as a 'retain', which could disrupt the logic for handling 'delete' and 'insert' operations, leading to incorrect transformations of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code skip the handling of 'delete' operations entirely, which could result in incorrect index adjustments and potentially leave some operations unprocessed.

DONE.
