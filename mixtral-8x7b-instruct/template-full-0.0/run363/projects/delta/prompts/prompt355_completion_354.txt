 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is an instance of the `Number` object, rather than checking if `arg` is a number primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof arg === 'object' && arg !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is an object (including arrays and other non-null values), rather than checking if `arg` is a number primitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is an array, rather than checking if `arg` is a number primitive.

DONE.
