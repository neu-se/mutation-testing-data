  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the concatenated values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds a new element to the end of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the concatenated values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the concatenated values.

DONE.
