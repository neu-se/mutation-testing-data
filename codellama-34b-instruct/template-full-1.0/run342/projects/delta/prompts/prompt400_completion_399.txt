  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.Prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.Prototype.keys` returns an array of the property names that are in the prototype chain of the object, whereas `Object.keys` only returns properties that are directly on the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's own properties, while `Object.keys` only returns property names.

DONE.
