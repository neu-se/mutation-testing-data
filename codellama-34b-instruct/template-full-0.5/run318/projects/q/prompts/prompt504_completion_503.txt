  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method to call the function with a specific context and argument list, while this replacement uses the function call operator to call the function with a different context and argument list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(value)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method to call the function with a specific context and argument list, while this replacement uses the `bind` method to create a new function with a specific context and argument list, and then calls that function with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` method to call the function with a specific context and argument list, while this replacement uses the `call` method to call the function with a specific context and no arguments.
