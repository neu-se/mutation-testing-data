  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `hasStacks` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment continues to execute the rest of the function if `hasStacks` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var e = new Error();
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `hasStacks` is false, and the error object would be different.

DONE.
