  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "people", but the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "peoples".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "people", but the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "person" with the plural form "peoplies" (because of the typo in the function).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'person')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "person"
