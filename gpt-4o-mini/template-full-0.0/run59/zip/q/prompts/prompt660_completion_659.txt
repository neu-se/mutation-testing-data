Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation being dispatched from "post" to "get", which would lead to incorrect method invocation and potentially unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, args, "extraArg"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument to the dispatch call, which could cause the method to fail or behave incorrectly if it does not expect more than the original arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name].concat(args))
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the arguments being passed by concatenating the `args` array to a new array containing only `name`, which could lead to incorrect argument handling in the dispatched method.

DONE.
