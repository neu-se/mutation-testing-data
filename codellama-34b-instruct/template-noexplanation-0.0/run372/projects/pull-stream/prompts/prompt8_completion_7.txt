  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This change will cause the `for` loop to iterate over the `sources` object instead of the `sinks` object, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This change will cause the `for` loop to iterate over the `throughs` object instead of the `sinks` object, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports
```
This change will cause the `for` loop to iterate over the `exports` object instead of the `sinks` object, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `pull` function.

DONE.
