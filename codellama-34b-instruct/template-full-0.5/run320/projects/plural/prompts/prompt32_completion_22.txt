  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would be applied to one fewer character, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would be applied to two fewer characters, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would be applied to a different starting position, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
