 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be the second argument, but passing `null` would change the number of arguments received by `Q.nbind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` expects `thisp` to be the third argument, but passing `this` would change the number of arguments received by `Q.nbind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` expects `thisp` to be the third argument, but passing `0` would change the type of the argument received by `Q.nbind` from an object to a number.

DONE.
