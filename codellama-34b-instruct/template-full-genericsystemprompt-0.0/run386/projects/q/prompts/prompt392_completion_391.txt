  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could affect the behavior of the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the argument list, which could cause the `when` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the argument list, which could cause the `when` function to behave differently.

DONE.
