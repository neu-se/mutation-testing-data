 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the response data would not be consumed, potentially causing memory issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately destroy the response, stopping the data flow and potentially causing the 'close' event not to trigger.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.unpipe
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the destination write stream from the response data pipeline, causing data to be discarded and the 'close' event not to trigger.

DONE.
