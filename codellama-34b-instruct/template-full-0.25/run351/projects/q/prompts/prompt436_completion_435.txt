  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, while `array_indexOf` checks if the element is present at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the element in the array, while `includes` returns a boolean value indicating whether the element is present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.some(p => p === promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` checks if any element in the array satisfies the given condition, while `includes` and `indexOf` check if the element is present at a specific index or in the array, respectively.

DONE.
