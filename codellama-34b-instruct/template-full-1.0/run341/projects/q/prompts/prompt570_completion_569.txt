  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolution, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolution` is not defined in the code snippet, while `result` is defined as a local variable in the `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<any> result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `<any>` would allow any value to be assigned to `result`, while `result` is defined as a local variable in the `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the parameters in the `continuer` function has been reversed.

DONE.
