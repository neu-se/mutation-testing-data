  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(array)[k]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the property name of the array instead of the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `i` by 1 for each iteration, which would cause the function to return different values than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
