  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method is not defined in the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method expects an array of promises, but `promises` is already an array of promises, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(promises).allSettled(Q.all(promises));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method expects an array of promises, but `Q.all(promises)` returns a promise that resolves to an array of values, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
