 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is truthy but falsy (e.g., `0`, `''`, or `null`), the callback would not be invoked, whereas in the original code, it would be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be scheduled for the next iteration of the event loop, rather than being invoked immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit('drain'); cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'drain'` event would be emitted before the callback is invoked, whereas in the original code, the callback is invoked before the `'drain'` event is emitted.

DONE.
