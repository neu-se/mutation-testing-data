Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a different HTTP status code than intended, potentially causing issues with the client's interpretation of the response, and the test suite should ideally catch this discrepancy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `statusCode` property of the `res` object directly, which could potentially be different from `this.statusCode` if the context of `this` has changed, and the test suite should verify that the correct status code is being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
200
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sends a status code of 200 (OK), regardless of the actual status code that should be sent, which could mask errors or other conditions that should be reported to the client, and the test suite should detect this hardcoded value.

DONE.
