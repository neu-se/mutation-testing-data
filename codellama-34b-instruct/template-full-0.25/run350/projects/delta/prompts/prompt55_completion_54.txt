  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an array, but `ops` is already guaranteed to be an array by the type declaration in the constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an empty array, but `ops` is already guaranteed to be non-empty by the type declaration in the constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is a non-empty array, but `ops` is already guaranteed to be non-empty by the type declaration in the constructor.

DONE.
