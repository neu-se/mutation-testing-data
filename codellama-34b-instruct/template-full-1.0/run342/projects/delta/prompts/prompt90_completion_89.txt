  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(lastOp.retain) && !isNaN(newOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the operand is not a number, so this code checks if `lastOp.retain` and `newOp.retain` are not numbers, whereas the original code checks if they are numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'string' && typeof newOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if `lastOp.retain` and `newOp.retain` are strings, whereas the original code checks if they are numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain > newOp.retain ? newOp.retain : lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because this code checks if `lastOp.retain` is greater
