  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` copies the values of all the own enumerable property names from one or more source objects to a target object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getPrototypeOf` returns the prototype of the specified object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names.

DONE.
