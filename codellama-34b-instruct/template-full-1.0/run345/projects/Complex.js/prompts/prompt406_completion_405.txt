  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is the inverse function of `Math.cos`, whereas `Math.atan2` is the inverse function of `Math.sin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` is the inverse function of `Math.sin`, whereas `Math.atan2` is the inverse function of `Math.cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is the inverse function of `Math.atan`, which is not the same as `Math.atan2`.

DONE.
