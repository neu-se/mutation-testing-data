  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a timezone object, while `getCountry` returns a country object, and the resulting object would have different properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: buildCountry(data, id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` returns a country object, while `getCountry` returns a country object, but the country object returned by `buildCountry` may not have the same properties and methods as the country object returned by `getCountry`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: data.countries[id] }
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.countries` is an object that contains country objects, while `getCountry` returns a country object, and the country object returned by `data.countries[id]` may not have the same properties and methods as the
