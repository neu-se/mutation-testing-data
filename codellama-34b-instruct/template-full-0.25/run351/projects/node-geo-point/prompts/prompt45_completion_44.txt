  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, which returns 1 if the condition is true, and the new code fragment uses the less-than operator, which returns 0 if the condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, which returns 1 if the condition is true, and the new code fragment multiplies the value of r by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, which returns 1 if the condition is true, and the new code fragment adds 1 to the value of r.

DONE.
