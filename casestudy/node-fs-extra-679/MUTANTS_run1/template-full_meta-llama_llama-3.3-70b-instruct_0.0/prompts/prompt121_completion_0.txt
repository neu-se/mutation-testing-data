Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent !== srcParent && destParent !== path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the function to continue checking parent paths even when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent === path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for the destination parent being the same as the source parent, allowing the function to continue checking parent paths even when the destination parent is the same as the source parent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent === srcParent
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for the destination parent being the root path, causing the function to stop checking parent paths prematurely when the destination parent is not the root path, but still a subdirectory of the source parent.

DONE.
