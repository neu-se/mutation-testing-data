  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, instead of a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array starting from a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array starting from the second element, instead of a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array starting from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array starting from the last element, instead of a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array starting from the first element.

DONE.
