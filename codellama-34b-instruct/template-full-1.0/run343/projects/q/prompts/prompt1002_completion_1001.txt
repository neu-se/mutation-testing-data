  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different method name and may cause a different behavior when called on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a different method name and may cause a different behavior when called on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
99
```
This would result in different behavior because 99 is a different value and may cause a different behavior when used in the context of the code.

DONE.
