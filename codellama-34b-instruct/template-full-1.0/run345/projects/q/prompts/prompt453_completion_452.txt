  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the last item from the array instead of pushing a new item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first item in the array instead of adding a new item.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the array instead of adding a new item.

DONE.
