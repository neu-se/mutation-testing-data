  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the + sign is incorrect and should be a - sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the +1 term is incorrect and should be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the *2 term is incorrect and should be removed.

DONE.
