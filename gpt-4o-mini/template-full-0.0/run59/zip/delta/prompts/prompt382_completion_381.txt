Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push a single character from the `other` Delta instead of the full length of the operation, potentially leading to incomplete data being retained in the resulting Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to push one more character than available in the `other` Delta, which could lead to an error or unexpected behavior if the length exceeds the available operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively push nothing from the `other` Delta, resulting in a Delta that does not include any of the intended insertions from the `other` Delta.

DONE.
