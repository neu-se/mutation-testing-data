Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandlerWrong
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent function, which would cause a runtime error instead of correctly retrieving the handler for the embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function call, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the handler relies on its context to function properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler('wrongType')
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the function to look for a handler for a non-existent type, which would likely return `undefined` or an incorrect handler, leading to unexpected results during transformation.

DONE.
