  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "chilli", "chillies", while the new code fragment is "chili", "chillis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "chilli", "chillies", while the new code fragment is "chilli", "chillis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "chilli", "chillies", while the new code fragment is "chili", "chillis".

DONE.
