  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment uses `-b`, which is the negation of `b`. This change would cause the `sin` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the complex exponent and the final result.

DONE.
