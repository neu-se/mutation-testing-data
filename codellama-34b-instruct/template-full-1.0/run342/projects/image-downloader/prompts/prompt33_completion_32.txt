  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resume()` method on the `res` object, which is not the same as the original fragment that does not call any method on the `res` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(process.stdout);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the data from the `res` object to the `process.stdout` stream, which is not the same as the original fragment that pipes the data to a file using `createWriteStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest + '.gz'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new file with the same name as the original destination file, but with the additional extension ".gz".

DONE.
