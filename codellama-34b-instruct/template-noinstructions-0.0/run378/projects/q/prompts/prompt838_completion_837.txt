  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the rejection reason as its argument, even if the rejection is handled by a `catch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function () {
    onUnhandledError();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with no arguments, even if the rejection is handled by a `catch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function (reason) {
    onUnhandledError(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the rejection reason as its argument, even if the rejection is handled by a `catch` method.

DONE
