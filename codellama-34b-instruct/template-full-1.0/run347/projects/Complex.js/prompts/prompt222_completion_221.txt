  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the complex number plus 1, which is not the expected behavior for the `sqrt` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the absolute value of the complex number, which is not the expected behavior for the `sqrt` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the complex number minus 1, which is not the expected behavior for the `sqrt` method.

DONE.
