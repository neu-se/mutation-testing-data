  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the function to exit immediately, whereas `reject` will cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` will cause the function to exit immediately, whereas `reject` will cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will cause an error to be thrown, whereas `reject` is a function that will cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
