Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument instead of starting from the second, potentially leading to incorrect binding of the function's context and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array from the `arguments` object, which may not maintain the intended structure or length of the original arguments, affecting how the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the arguments starting from the second argument, which could lead to unexpected results if the original `arguments` object is modified later in the code.

DONE.
