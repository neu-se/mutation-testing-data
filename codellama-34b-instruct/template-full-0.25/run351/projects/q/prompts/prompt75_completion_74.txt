  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestPortTick` function immediately, rather than passing it as a reference to be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick.bind(window)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `requestPortTick` function to the `window` object, rather than passing it as a reference to be called later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestPortTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `requestPortTick` function to be called later, rather than passing it as a reference to be called immediately.

DONE.
