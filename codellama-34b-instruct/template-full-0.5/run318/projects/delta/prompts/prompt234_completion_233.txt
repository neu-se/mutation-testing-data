  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation, rather than just the length of the insertion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire length of the operation, rather than just the length of the insertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength, { bold: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation and apply a bold attribute to the text.

DONE.
