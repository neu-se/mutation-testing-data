  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes parameters and returns a value, while `aborted()` is a function that takes no parameters and returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, asyncMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes parameters and returns a value, while `read(abort, asyncMap)` is a function that takes one parameter and returns a value. Additionally, `asyncMap` is a function that takes two parameters and returns a value, which is different from the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, asyncMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that takes parameters and returns a value, while `map(data, asyncMap)` is a function that takes two parameters and returns a value. Additionally
