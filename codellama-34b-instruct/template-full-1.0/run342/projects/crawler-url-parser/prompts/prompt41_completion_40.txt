  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function expects a string as its first argument, but `baseUrlStr` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof baseUrlStr === 'undefined' ? 'http://example.com' : baseUrlStr;
```
This would result in different behavior because if `baseUrlStr` is undefined, the `parse` function will use a default URL instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr ? baseUrlStr + '/' : 'http://example.com/';
```
This would result in different behavior because if `baseUrlStr` is not null or undefined, it will be concatenated with a forward slash, which may change the result of the `parse` function.

DONE.
