 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'goose'.concat('', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the ternary operator to conditionally choose between 'goose' and 'geese', it concatenates an empty string to 'goose', which would always return 'goosegoose' as the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the original function that checks for specific conditions before appending 'es', it would blindly append 'es' to any input word, which may not always result in the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/o$/, 'x') }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of checking if the word ends with a vowel before replacing the 'o' with 'es' or
