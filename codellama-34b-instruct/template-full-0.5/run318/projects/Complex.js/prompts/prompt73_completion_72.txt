  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the program to terminate with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a string argument, which would cause the program to terminate with an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("parser error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the program to terminate with an error message.

DONE.
