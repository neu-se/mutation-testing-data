  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as an argument to the `fulfilled` callback, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an argument to the `fulfilled` callback, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
