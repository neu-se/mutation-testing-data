  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `substr` method being called with a negative value, which would return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `substr` method being called with a zero value, which would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the `substr` method being called with a negative value, which would return the last character of the string.

DONE.
