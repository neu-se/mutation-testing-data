Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!opts.stripWWW && /^www\.([a-z\-\d]{2,63})\.([a-z\.]{2,5})$/.test(urlObj.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `opts.stripWWW`, causing the `www.` to be removed when `stripWWW` is `false`, and not removed when `stripWWW` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opts.stripWWW && /^www\.([a-z\-\d]{1,63})\.([a-z\.]{1,5})$/.test(urlObj.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the character classes in the regular expression have been modified to allow for shorter domain names and extensions, which could lead to incorrect removal of `www.` from hostnames that do not meet the original criteria.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opts.stripWWW && urlObj.hostname.startsWith('www.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
