  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is not set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the non-deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` option, so if it was set to `true`, it would become `false`, and if it was set to `false`, it would become `true`.

DONE.
