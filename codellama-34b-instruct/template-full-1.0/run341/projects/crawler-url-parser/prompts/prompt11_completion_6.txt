  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a single forward slash instead of a double forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a single forward slash and then any number of forward slashes instead of a double forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match HTTP or HTTPS URLs with a domain name instead of a file path.

DONE.
