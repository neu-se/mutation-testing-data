  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator checks for the truthiness of the expression, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, if `result[country]` is `undefined`, the `!` operator would return `true`, while `===` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while `!` checks for truthiness. In this case, if `result[country]` is `undefined`, the `!==` operator would return `true`, while `!` would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, while `!` checks for truthiness. In this case, if `result[country]` is `undefined`, the
