  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `pop` would cause the `filterStackString` function to return a different value than the original code, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
