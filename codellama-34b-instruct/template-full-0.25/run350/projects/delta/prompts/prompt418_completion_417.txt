  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the last operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to include an extra operation in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to include twice as many operations in the delta.

DONE.
