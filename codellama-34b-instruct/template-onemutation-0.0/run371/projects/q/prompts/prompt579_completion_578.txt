  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `this` context set to `continuer`, which is not the intended behavior. The `bind` method is used to create a new function with a specific `this` context and arguments, but in this case, it is not necessary and could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
