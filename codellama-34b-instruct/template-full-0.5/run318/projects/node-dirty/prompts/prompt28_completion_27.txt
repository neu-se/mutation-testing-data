  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the event listener would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain' - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the event listener would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain' + '_'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be different, and the event listener would not be triggered.

DONE.
