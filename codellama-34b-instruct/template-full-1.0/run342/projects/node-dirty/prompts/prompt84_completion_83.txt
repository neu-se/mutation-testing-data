  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of `\t` instead of `\n` would produce a different output when parsing the database file, potentially leading to incorrect data being loaded into the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of `'\\n'` instead of `\n` would produce a different output when parsing the database file, potentially leading to invalid JSON data being loaded into the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of an empty string instead of `\n` would produce a different output when parsing the database file, potentially leading to invalid JSON data being loaded into the cache.

DONE.
