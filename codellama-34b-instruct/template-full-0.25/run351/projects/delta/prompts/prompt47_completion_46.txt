  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of the variable `a`, while the modified code fragment `a + 1` would return the value of `a` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of the variable `a`, while the modified code fragment `b` would return the value of the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of the variable `a`, while the modified code fragment `a - 1` would return the value of `a` minus 1.

DONE.
