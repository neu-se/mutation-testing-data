  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one, which would cause the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a null value instead of a promise, which would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with a `TypeError` instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive an undefined value instead of a promise, which would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with a `TypeError` instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

DONE.
