  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed function to be called with the rejection reason, rather than the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed function to be called with the fulfillment value, rather than the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed function to be called with no arguments, rather than the fulfillment value or rejection reason.

DONE.
