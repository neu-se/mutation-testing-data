  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<getCountryForTimezone(tzName, { deprecated: true });>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country name, as the `getCountryForTimezone` function is called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<getTimezonesForCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true });>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different list of timezone names, as the `getTimezonesForCountry` function is called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<getAllTimezones({ deprecated: true });>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different list of timezones, as the `getAllTimezones` function is called with different arguments.

DONE.
