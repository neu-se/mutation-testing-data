  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` would return the data passed to the callback, whereas `null` would return null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` would return the data passed to the callback, whereas `undefined` would return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` would return the data passed to the callback, whereas `0` would return zero.

DONE.
