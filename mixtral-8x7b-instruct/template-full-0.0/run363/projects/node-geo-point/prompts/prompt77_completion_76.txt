 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 360 instead of using the provided bearing value. This can cause the calculated destination point to be in a different direction than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the bearing to 0, regardless of the provided value. This can cause the calculated destination point to be in a constant direction, which is not accurate in most cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude value instead of the bearing. This can cause the calculated destination point to be in a wrong direction, as the latitude value is not related to the bearing.

DONE.
