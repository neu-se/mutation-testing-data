  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because `keepNull` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `keepNull` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because `!keepNull` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even if `keepNull` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `keepNull !== false` would always be `true`, even if `keepNull` is `false`.

DONE.
