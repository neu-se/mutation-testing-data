 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'N'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the character 'N' instead of the character represented by the code point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0x00
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the null character instead of the character represented by the code point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String.fromCodePoint
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `fromCodePoint` method instead of the `fromCharCode` method, which could produce different results for certain code points.

DONE.
