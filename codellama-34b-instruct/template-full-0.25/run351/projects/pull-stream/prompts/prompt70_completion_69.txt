  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of `===` to compare `abort` to `false`. This would cause the `abort` function to be called when `op` is truthy and `data` is falsy, instead of when `op` is falsy or `data` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called when `op` is truthy and `data` is falsy, instead of when `op` is falsy or `data` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value is always returned, instead of the result of the `op` function
