  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.exp` function with the argument `-x`, which is different from the replacement code fragment that uses the `Math.exp` function with the argument `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.exp` function with the argument `-x`, which is different from the replacement code fragment that uses the `Math.exp` function with the argument `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.exp` function with the argument `-x`, which is different from the replacement code fragment that uses the `Math.exp` function with the argument `x`.

DONE.
