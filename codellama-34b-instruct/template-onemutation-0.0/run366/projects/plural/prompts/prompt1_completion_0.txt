  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`, but the new code fragment is using the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)`, which is a different substring.

DONE.
