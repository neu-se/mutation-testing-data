  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property, whereas the `!isObject` function checks if the value is an object. In this case, the `point` object may have a `type` property that is not a direct property, and the `!isObject` function would return `false`, while the `!point.hasOwnProperty('type')` would return `true`.
