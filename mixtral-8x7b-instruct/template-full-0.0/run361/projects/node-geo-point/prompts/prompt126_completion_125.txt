 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would always return 0, regardless of the input points. This is because the `calculateDistance` method relies on the `this` keyword to access the coordinates of the current object, but replacing it with 0 would effectively remove that reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
