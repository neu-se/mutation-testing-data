  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different method than `reject`, and would not cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with a different argument, which would affect the value of the rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with a different argument, which would affect the value of the rejected promise.

DONE.
