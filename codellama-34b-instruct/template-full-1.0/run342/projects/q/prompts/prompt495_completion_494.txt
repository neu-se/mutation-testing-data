  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would untrack the rejection, meaning that it would not be able to be handled later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the unhandled rejection, which would cause it to be handled later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ReportUnhandledRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would report the unhandled rejection, which would cause it to be handled later.

DONE.
