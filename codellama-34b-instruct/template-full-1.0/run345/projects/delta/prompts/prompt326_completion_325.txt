  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different property of the `op` object than `op.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op.delete` is the opposite of `op.delete`, so the resulting behavior would be the inverse of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete || op.retain` would always return `op.retain`, even if `op.delete` is true, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
