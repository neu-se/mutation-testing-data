  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` array has at least one element, whereas the original code fragment checks if the `ops` array is not null and is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && typeof ops.ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` object has an `ops` property that is an object, whereas the original code fragment checks if the `ops` array is not null and is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `ops` array has no elements, whereas the original code fragment checks if the `ops` array is not null and is an array.

DONE.
