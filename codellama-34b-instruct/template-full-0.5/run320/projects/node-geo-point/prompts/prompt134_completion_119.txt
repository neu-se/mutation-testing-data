  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of `toFixed()`, which would cause the `adjustPrecision()` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of `toFixed()` by 2, which would cause the `adjustPrecision()` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of `toFixed()`, which would cause the `adjustPrecision()` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
