  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method with a delay of 0 milliseconds would immediately resolve the promise, causing the `timeout` method to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(100)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method with a delay of 100 milliseconds would resolve the promise after 100 milliseconds, causing the `timeout` method to be called after 100 milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method with a delay of 1000 milliseconds would resolve the promise after 1 second, causing the `timeout` method to be called after 1 second.

DONE.
