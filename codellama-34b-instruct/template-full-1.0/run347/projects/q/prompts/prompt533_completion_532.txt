  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the fulfilled function to a new object, rather than the original promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an empty reason, rather than fulfilling it with the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function *() {
    yield fulfilled();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new generator function that yields the result of calling the fulfilled function, rather than simply calling the fulfilled function.

DONE.
