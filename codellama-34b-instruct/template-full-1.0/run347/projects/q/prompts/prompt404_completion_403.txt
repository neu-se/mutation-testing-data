  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to `reason`, whereas the original code simply passes `reason` as-is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` would convert `reason` to a string, whereas the original code passes a reference to `reason` as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of `reason` as a array, whereas the original code passes a reference to `reason` as-is.

DONE.
