  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(done || function () {})(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `done` argument is a function and if so, calls it with no arguments. This replacement calls the `done` function with the argument `null`, which may cause a type error or unexpected behavior in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(done || function () {})(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `done` argument is a function and if so, calls it with no arguments. This replacement calls the `done` function with the argument `true`, which may cause a different type error or unexpected behavior in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(done || function () {})('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `done` argument is a function and if so, calls it with no arguments.
