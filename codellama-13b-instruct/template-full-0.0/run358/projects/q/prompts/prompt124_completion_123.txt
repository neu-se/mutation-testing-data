  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the object has an own property with the given key, while the buggy code fragment would check if the object has an own property with the given key, regardless of whether it is an own property or inherited from a prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, "key")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the object has an own property with the given key, while the buggy code fragment would check if the object has an own property with the key "key", regardless of whether it is an own property or inherited from a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, "key" + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the object has an own property with the given key, while the
