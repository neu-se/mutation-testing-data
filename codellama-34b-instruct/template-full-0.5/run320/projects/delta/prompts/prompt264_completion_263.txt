  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object to be used instead of the `attributes` property, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object to be used instead of the `attributes` property, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` property of the `otherOp` object to be used instead of the `attributes` property, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
