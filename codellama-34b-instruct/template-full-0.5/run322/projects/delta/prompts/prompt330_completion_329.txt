  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the length of the operation, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract an extra character from the length of the operation, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
