  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is a negation of the `end` variable, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `end` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && data` is a logical AND operation that checks if both `end` and `data` are truthy. If `end` is `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, even if `data` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || data` is a logical OR operation that checks if either `end` or `data` are truthy. If `end` is `false`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if `data` is falsy.
