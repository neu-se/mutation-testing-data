  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(cos(φ1) + cosφ1) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated expression would include the value of `cosφ1` twice, which would cause the whole expression to be twice as large as the original one. This would change the resulting longitude value and make the test case fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(cos(φ1) - cosφ1) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated expression would subtract the value of `cosφ1` from `cos(φ1)`, which would cause the resulting longitude value to be different from the original one. This would make the test case fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log(cos(φ1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated expression would use the natural logarithm of the value of `cos(φ1)`, which would result in a completely different longitude value. This would make the test case fail.
