 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver()();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is immediately invoked, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected before the Node.js-style callback is added to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is directly resolved, bypassing the Node.js-style callback mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('Error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is directly rejected, bypassing the Node.js-style callback mechanism.

DONE.
