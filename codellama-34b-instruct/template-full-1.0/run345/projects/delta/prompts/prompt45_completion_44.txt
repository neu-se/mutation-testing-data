  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b && typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` would return `true` if `b` is any falsy value, such as `0`, an empty string, or `false`. In the original code, `typeof b !== 'object'` would only be executed if `b` is truthy, which means it can never be evaluated as `false` if `b` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(b)` would return `true` if `b` is an array, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `!b` would also return `true` if `b` is an array, because arrays are objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in
