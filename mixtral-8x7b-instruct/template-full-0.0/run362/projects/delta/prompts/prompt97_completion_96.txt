 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the newOp to the last index of the ops array instead of pushing it to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an out-of-bounds error when trying to access the lastOp variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it overwrites the existing op at the specified index instead of inserting a new op.

DONE.
