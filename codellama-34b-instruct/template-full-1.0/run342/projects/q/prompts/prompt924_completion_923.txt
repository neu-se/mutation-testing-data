  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```java
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `nodeArgs` as an array of arguments to pass to the `q.fapply()` method, while `undefined` would result in a error as it is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```java
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `nodeArgs` as an array of arguments to pass to the `q.fapply()` method, while `null` would result in a error as it is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```java
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `nodeArgs` as an array of arguments to pass to the `q.fapply()` method, while `[]` would result in a different array being passed to the method, potentially causing a different behavior.

DONE.
