Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a recursive call to the same function instead of calling the intended `getCountriesForTimezone`, potentially leading to a stack overflow or infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `getTimezone` instead of `getCountriesForTimezone`, which means it will return timezone data instead of the list of countries associated with that timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone(tzName)
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `options` parameter, which may lead to different results if the function relies on options for filtering or modifying the output.

DONE.
