  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than checking if the property exists on the object. This could cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` even if the object has the `latitude` and `longitude` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than checking if the property exists on the object. This could cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` even if the object has the `latitude` or `longitude` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
