  Option 1:
```
pageurl_path.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` will return a part of the string starting from the index specified in the first argument, whereas `replace` will replace a portion of the string with another string.

Option 2:
```
pageurl_path[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl_path[0]` will return the first character of the string, whereas `pageurl_path.replace` will replace a portion of the string with another string.

Option 3:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\//g, '_')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` will replace all occurrences of `/` with `_`, whereas the original code only replaces the `pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')` removes the last component of a URL path.

DONE.
