  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a null value instead of the expected object with a `filename` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: 'wrong_file.txt' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a different filename than the expected one.

DONE.
