  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + str
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string `str` with the number `1`, resulting in a string that is different from the original `str` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string `str` to uppercase, resulting in a different string than the original `str` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the string `str` into an array of individual characters, resulting in a different data structure than the original `str` value.

DONE.
