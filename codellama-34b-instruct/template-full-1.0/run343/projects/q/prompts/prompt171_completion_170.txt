  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function check if an object is an instance of `QReturnValue`, but in the original code, the check is done on the `StopIteration` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function check if an object is promise-like (i.e. has a `then` method), but in the original code, the check is done directly on the `value` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function always returns false, so the code within the `if` block would never be executed, but in the original code, the condition is checked before executing the code within the `if` block.

DONE.
