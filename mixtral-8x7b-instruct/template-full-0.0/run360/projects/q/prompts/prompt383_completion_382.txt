 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the callback in an arrow function, which may affect how 'this' is bound or how arguments are passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of 'this' inside the callback, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a default empty function as a second argument to the 'fcall' method, which may cause the 'thenResolve' method to always return a resolved promise.

DONE.
