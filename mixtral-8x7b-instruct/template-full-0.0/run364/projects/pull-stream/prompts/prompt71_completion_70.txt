 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` value will always be falsy, which might not be the intended behavior in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + op
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of `op` to a number, which might not be expected in the original code. This could lead to unexpected results if the rest of the code assumes `op` is a boolean or another type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes `op` is a string and tries to convert it to uppercase, which might not be expected in the original code. This could lead to errors or unexpected results if the rest of the code assumes `op` is a boolean or another type.

DONE.
