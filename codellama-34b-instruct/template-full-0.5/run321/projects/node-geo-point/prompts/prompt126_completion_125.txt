  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would fail with a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the `latitude` and `longitude` properties of the `null` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would return a distance of 0 meters, regardless of the actual distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude + 1, this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would return a distance that is 1 degree of latitude and 1 degree of longitude greater than the actual distance between the two points.

DONE.
