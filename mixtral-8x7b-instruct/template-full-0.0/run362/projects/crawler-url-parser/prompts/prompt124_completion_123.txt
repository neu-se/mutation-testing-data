 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator, not an array. The `Array.from()` method would not be able to convert it, and the `map()` method would not be available to process the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of URL objects instead of an array of objects with `url`, `text`, and `type` properties. The `map()` method would not be able to process the URL objects correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap.values()).map(el => ({ url: el.url, text: el.text, type: el.type }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object for each element in the array, which may cause issues if the original objects have methods or other
