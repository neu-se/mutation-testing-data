  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error when attempting to call `apply` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and would not have a `length` property, which is used in the `switch` statement to determine the number of arguments to pass to `pull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and would not have a `length` property, which is used in the `switch` statement to determine the number of arguments to pass to `pull`.

DONE.
