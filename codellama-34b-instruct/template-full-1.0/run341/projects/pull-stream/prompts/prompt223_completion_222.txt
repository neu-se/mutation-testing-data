  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tester
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester` is a function that takes a parameter and returns a boolean value, while `!tester` is a negation operator that returns the opposite boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester` is a function, and `tester.prop` is a property access, which would return the value of the `prop` property of the `tester` object, whereas the original code fragment was just a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester()
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester()` is a function call, which would execute the `tester` function and return its return value, whereas the original code fragment was just a function reference.

DONE.
