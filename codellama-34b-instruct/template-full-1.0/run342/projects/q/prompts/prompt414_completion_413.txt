  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object && object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `isPromiseAlike` checks if `object` is an object and if it has a `then` method. In this variant, the `&&` operator is used to check if `object` is truthy and if `object.then` is defined. If either of these conditions is not met, the function will return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `isPromiseAlike` checks if `object` is an object and if it has a `then` method. In this variant, the `instanceof` operator is used to check if `object` is an instance of the `Promise` class. If it is not, the function will return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then && object.then instanceof Function
```
This would result in
