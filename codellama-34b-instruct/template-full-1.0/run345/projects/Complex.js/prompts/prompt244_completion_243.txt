  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
This would result in different behavior because it would be computing the sine of the complex number instead of the cosine.
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``Math.abs(this['re'])
This would result in different behavior because it would be computing the absolute value of the real part of the complex number instead of the cosine.
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
This would result in different behavior because it would be computing the arc tangent of the real part of the complex number instead of the cosine.
```

DONE.
