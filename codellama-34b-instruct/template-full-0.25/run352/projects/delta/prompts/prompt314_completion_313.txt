  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(new Op('delete', Op.length(op)))
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the document.

DONE.
