  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the thrown error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, while `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
