  Option 1:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` returns `true` if the object is a promise, whereas `isPromise` returns `true` only if the object is a native promise.

Option 2:
```
!isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromiseAlike` returns `true` if the object is not a promise, whereas `isPromise` returns `true` only if the object is a native promise.

Option 3:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` returns `true` if the object is a fulfilled promise, whereas `isPromise` returns `true` only if the object is a native promise.

DONE.
