  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument order is swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name is incorrect, as there is no Math.atan method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument order is swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
