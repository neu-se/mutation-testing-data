  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, which would cause the callback to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the callback with the `this` value set to `null`, which would cause the callback to be called with the wrong context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the callback with the `this` value set to `null`, which would cause the callback to be called with the wrong context.

DONE.
