  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are passed in the opposite order, which could cause unexpected results or errors if the function or method being called expects them in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is set to 0, which could cause the function or method being called to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because null is added as a leading argument, which could cause the function or method being called to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

DONE.
