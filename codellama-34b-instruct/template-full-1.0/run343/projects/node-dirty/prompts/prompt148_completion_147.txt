  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment iterates over the `cbs` array and calls each callback function, while `cb.shift()` would only call the first callback function in the array and ignore the rest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment iterates over the `cbs` array and calls each callback function, while `cb.pop()` would only call the last callback function in the array and ignore the rest.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment iterates over the `cbs` array and calls each callback function, while `cb()` would attempt to call the `cb` function itself, which is not a callback function and would likely result in an error.

DONE.
