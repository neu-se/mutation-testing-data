  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a fragment with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a fragment with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a fragment with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a fragment with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '\\w+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a fragment with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a fragment with a word character.

DONE.
