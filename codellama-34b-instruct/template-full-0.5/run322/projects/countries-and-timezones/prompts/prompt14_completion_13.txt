  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` arrays would be initialized with the same value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` array would be initialized with an empty array, while the `all` array would be initialized with the `id` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` array would be initialized with the `id` value, while the `all` array would be initialized with an empty array.

DONE.
