  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would emit the `'drain'` event even if the write stream is not closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would emit the `'write'` event even if the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'_writesFinished'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would emit the `'drain'` event after all writes have finished, but it would not take into account if the write stream is closed.

DONE.
