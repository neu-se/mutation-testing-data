 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the subtraction operation to addition, which would lead to incorrect offset calculations in the `transformPosition` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(index - offset)
