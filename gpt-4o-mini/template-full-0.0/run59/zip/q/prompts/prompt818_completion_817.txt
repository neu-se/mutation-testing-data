Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the fulfillment handler instead of handling the rejection, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore the rejection handler, meaning that any rejection would not be handled, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Forced error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force an error to be thrown regardless of the promise's state, causing the promise chain to reject with a new error instead of propagating the original rejection.

DONE.
