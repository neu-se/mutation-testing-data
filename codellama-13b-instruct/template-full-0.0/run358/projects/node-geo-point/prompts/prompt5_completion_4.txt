  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function is called with the `point` argument, which is an object with a `type` property and a `coordinates` property. The original code fragment only checks if the `point` argument is an object, but this code fragment also checks if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` property of the `point` object is compared to the string `'Point'`. The original code fragment only checks if the `point` argument is an object, but this code fragment also checks if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty
