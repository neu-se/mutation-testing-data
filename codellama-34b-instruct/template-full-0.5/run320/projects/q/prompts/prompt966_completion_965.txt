  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `null` is a distinct value that is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `undefined` is a distinct value that is not the same as `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `this` is a keyword that refers to the current execution context.

DONE.
