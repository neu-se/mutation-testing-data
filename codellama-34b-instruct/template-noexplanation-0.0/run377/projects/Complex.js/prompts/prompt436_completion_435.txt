  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This will ensure that the `places` variable is never equal to zero, which could cause the `floor` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || -1
```
This will ensure that the `places` variable is never equal to zero, and will also cause the `floor` function to return negative results for negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.PI
```
This will ensure that the `places` variable is never equal to zero, and will also cause the `floor` function to return results that are offset by a factor of pi.

DONE.
