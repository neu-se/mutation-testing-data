  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` method returns the index of the first match, while `match` method returns the matched string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` method returns the index of the first match, while `match` method returns the matched string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` method returns a boolean indicating whether the string contains the specified substring, while `match` method returns the matched string.

DONE.
