  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'array' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable, and an array is not an object. Therefore, this code would always evaluate to `false`, even if `stream` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable, and a function is not an object. Therefore, this code would always evaluate to `false`, even if `stream` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'number' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable, and a number is not an object. Therefore, this code would always evaluate to `false`, even if `stream` is a number.

DONE.
