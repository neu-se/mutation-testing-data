  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to skip the first operation in the `other` delta, which may result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to skip the last operation in the `other` delta, which may result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, -1)
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to skip the first and last operations in the `other` delta, which may result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
