  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write to the write stream instead of the read stream, which could cause data corruption and break the functionality of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the size of the queue, causing it to grow much faster and potentially leading to memory issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write an empty string to the write stream, which could cause data corruption and break the functionality of the program.

DONE.
