  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const dummyAttribute = new AttributeMap();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `attributes` object with an empty attribute map, effectively removing any attributes that may have been present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `attributes` object with `null`, which would cause any subsequent code to fail if it tries to access or modify the attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const attributes = new AttributeMap({ dummy: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `attributes` object with a new attribute map containing a single attribute named `dummy` with a value of `true`, which would be different from the original code.

DONE.
