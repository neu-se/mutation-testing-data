  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy before assigning `data`, while this new code fragment always assigns `null` to `data`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy before assigning `data`, while this new code fragment always assigns `undefined` to `data`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy before assigning `data`, while this new code fragment always assigns `data` to `end`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
