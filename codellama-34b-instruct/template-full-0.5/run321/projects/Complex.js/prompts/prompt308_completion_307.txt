  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number instead of multiplying it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the imaginary part of the complex number instead of multiplying it by 2.

DONE.
