  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original `read` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original `read` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would cause the function to return a different value than the original `read` variable.

DONE.
