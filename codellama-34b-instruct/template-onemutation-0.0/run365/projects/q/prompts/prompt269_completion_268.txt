  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise. Using `throw` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with an unhandled exception, which would result in different behavior.
