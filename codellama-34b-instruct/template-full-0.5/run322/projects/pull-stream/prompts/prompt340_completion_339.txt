  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `filter` function, while `null` is a literal value that does not reference any variable or parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `filter` function, while `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `filter` function, while `'data'` is a string literal that does not reference any variable or parameter.

DONE.
