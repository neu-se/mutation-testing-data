  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(false)` returns a fulfilled promise with the value `false`, whereas `Q` returns a fulfilled promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` returns a fulfilled promise with the value `null`, whereas `Q` returns a fulfilled promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
