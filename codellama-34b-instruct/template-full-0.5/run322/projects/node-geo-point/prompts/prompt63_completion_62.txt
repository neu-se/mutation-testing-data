  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value of the second point would be used instead of the latitude value of the first point, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value of the first point would be used instead of the latitude value of the second point, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value of the second point would be used instead of the latitude value of the second point, leading to an incorrect calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
