  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is only checking if the base is infinite and the exponent is zero, but the original code fragment also checks if the base is zero and the exponent is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is only checking if either the base or the exponent is infinite or zero, but the original code fragment checks if both the base and the exponent are infinite or zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
