 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of rules will be reversed, potentially changing the output of the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
var rules = [match, result]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rules` array will be overwritten with the current `match` and `result`, discarding all previous rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it resets the `rules` array, discarding all previously added rules, and thus affecting the output of the `plural` function.

DONE.
