  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush()` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `flush` is a reference to the `flush` function that is called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout()` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `flush` is a reference to the `flush` function that is called later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate()` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `flush` is a reference to the `flush` function that is called later.

DONE.
