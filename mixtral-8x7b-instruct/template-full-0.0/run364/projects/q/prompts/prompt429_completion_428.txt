 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the string 'rejected' instead of checking the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 'rejected' instead of checking the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}['state']
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 'undefined' instead of checking the state of the promise.

DONE.
