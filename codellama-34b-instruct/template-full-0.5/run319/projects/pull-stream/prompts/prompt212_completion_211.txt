  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is just a reference to the `abortCb` function, while the modified code fragment calls the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is just a reference to the `abortCb` function, while the modified code fragment calls the function with `this` as the context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is just a reference to the `abortCb` function, while the modified code fragment calls the function with `this` as the context and `arguments` as the arguments.

DONE.
