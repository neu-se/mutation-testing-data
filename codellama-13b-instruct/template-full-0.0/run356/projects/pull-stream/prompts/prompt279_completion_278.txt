  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is not defined in the current scope, and the `id` property is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is not defined in the current scope, and the `id` property is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.id()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is not defined in the current scope, and the `id` property is not a function.

DONE.
