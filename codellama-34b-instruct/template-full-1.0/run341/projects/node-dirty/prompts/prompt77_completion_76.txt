  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value (1) would be emitted in the 'load' event instead of the expected 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._inFlightWrites
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value (the number of in-flight writes) would be emitted in the 'load' event instead of the expected 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value (the size of the data) would be emitted in the 'load' event instead of the expected 0.

DONE.
