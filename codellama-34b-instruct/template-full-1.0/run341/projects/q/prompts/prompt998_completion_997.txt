  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the argument to `dispatch` to be an object instead of a function, which would likely cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foobar"
```
Thia would result in different behavior because it would cause the argument to `dispatch` to be a string instead of a function, which would likely cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
Thia would result in different behavior because it would cause the argument to `dispatch` to be null, which would likely cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
