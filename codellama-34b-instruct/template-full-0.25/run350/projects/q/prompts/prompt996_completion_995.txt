  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that resolves the promise, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that resolves the promise, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that resolves the promise, while `() => {}` is a function that does not resolve the promise.

DONE.
