  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` if the number is not NaN or infinity, whereas `isNaN` returns `true` if the number is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` returns `true` if the number is NaN or infinity, whereas `isNaN` returns `true` if the number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is infinity, whereas `isNaN` returns `true` if the number is NaN.

DONE.
