 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enforce strict mode for the entire script, which could potentially cause issues with existing code that relies on implicit behavior or global variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an unnecessary statement, potentially causing confusion or unexpected behavior in the code that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete process;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete the `process` object, which could cause issues with any code that relies on it (such as the Node.js-specific code later in the script).

DONE.
