  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both numbers and objects, while this new code fragment only checks for strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both numbers and objects, while this new code fragment only checks for null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both numbers and objects, while this new code fragment only checks for objects that are not null.

DONE.
