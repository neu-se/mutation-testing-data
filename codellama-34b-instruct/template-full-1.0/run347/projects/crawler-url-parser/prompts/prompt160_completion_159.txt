  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
([./])
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character, including periods and forward slashes, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
([\S])
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any non-whitespace character, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
([^\/])
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any character that is not a forward slash, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
