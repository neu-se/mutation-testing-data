  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, while `next` returns the next operation and advances the iterator. Using `peek` would cause the code to enter an infinite loop, as the iterator would always be pointing to the same operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more operations in the iterator, while `next` returns the next operation. Using `hasNext` would cause the code to enter an infinite loop, as the iterator would always be pointing to the same operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the number of operations in the iterator, while `next` returns the next operation. Using `length
