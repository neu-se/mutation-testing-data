  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments)` would return an empty array, whereas `array_slice` would return the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(arguments)` would return an empty array, whereas `array_slice` would return the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(this)` would return the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function, whereas `array_slice` would return the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function.

DONE.
