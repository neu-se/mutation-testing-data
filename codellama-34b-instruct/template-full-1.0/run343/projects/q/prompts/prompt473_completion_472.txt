  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
repliedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not a  function and cannot be invoked with `()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[atReport]
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and it would result in  an `undefined` value being passed to the `array_indexOf` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not always the same as the `length` of the underlying data structure, and it would result in an incorrect index being used to access the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
