  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reduce` is a method that reduces the elements of an array to a single value, while `parts.reverse` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reduce` reduces the elements of an array to a single value, while `parts.slice(1)` returns a new array with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.concat(parts)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reduce` reduces the elements of an array to a single value, while `parts.concat(parts)` returns a new array with the elements of `parts` concatenated with itself.

DONE.
