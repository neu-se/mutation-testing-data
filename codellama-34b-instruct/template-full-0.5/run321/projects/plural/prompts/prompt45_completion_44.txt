  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a y at the end of the word, while this code fragment checks for the presence of a vowel followed by o.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ie' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'es' to the end of the word, while this code fragment appends 'ie' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length
