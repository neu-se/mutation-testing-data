  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because now the concatenated stack traces will not have any new lines between them, making it harder to read and understand the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because now the concatenated stack traces will have carriage return and line feed characters between them, making it harder to read and understand the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because now the concatenated stack traces will not have any separation between them, making it harder to read and understand the stack trace.

DONE.
