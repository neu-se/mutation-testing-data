 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of all enumerable properties of the current object, not an empty array. This change would cause the `keys()` method to return an array of keys of the current object's properties instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor.prototype.keys
