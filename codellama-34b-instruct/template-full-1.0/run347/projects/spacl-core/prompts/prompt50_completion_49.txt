  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would always return the entire string instead of a subset of it, depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` and `join` methods would create a new string with no characters, effectively removing the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt` method would always return the first character of the input string, regardless of its length or content.

DONE.
