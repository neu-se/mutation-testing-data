  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.host` is a string representing the hostname of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object representing the URL as a whole.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object representing the URL as a whole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.pathname` is a string representing the pathname of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object representing the URL as a whole.

DONE.
