  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function returns a value between -π/2 and π/2, whereas the `acos` function returns a value between 0 and π.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function returns the sine of the input value, whereas the `acos` function returns the inverse cosine of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1/x` expression will produce a different result than the `acos` function for most inputs.

DONE.
