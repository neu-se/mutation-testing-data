  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'close'` event is emitted when the archive is fully read, while the `'finish'` event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system. Replacing `'close'` with `'finish'` would cause the program to exit before all data is written to the output stream, potentially resulting in a corrupted archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is emitted when the archive is fully read and the output stream is closed. Replacing `'close'` with `'end'` would cause the program to exit before the output stream is closed, potentially resulting in a corrupted archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs during the archive creation process. Replacing `'close'` with `'error
