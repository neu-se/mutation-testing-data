  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which returns `true` if either operand is truthy. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which returns `true` if both operands are truthy. This means that the new code fragment will only return `true` if both `this._queue.size` and `this._inFlightWrites` are truthy, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if either operand was truthy.

DONE.
