 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject.bind(deferred));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would have a fixed `this` value, which might not be the desired behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(null, deferred.reject);
