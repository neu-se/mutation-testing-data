 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('url').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly specifies the `url` module, while the original code relies on the implicit `global.URL` object. This might cause issues if a custom `URL` object is defined in the codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.URL.parse
