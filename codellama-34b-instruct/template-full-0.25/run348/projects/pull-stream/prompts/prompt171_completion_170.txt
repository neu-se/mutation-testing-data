  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `false` would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `null` would always return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `array[i++]` would return the value of the array at the current index `i`, and then increment `i` by 1.

DONE.
