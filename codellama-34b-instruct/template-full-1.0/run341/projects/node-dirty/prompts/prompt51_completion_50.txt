  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the size of the value retrieved from the database, rather than the size of the value stored in the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set('key', 'value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set a new value in the database, rather than retrieving the value stored in the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the value stored in the cache, rather than retrieve it.

DONE.
