Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to push the current operation into the `line` even when the index is negative, which is not the intended logic of processing lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the current operation into the `line` when the index is exactly zero, potentially skipping valid operations that should be processed when the index is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to push the current operation into the `line` for all non-negative indices, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that should only be processed for positive indices.

DONE.
