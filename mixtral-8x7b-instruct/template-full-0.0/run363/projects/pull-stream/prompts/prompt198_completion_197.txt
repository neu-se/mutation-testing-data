 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete or handle any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with a null error, even if an error occurred in the read or map functions. This could hide potential issues and make it harder to debug the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Skipping...')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would print a message instead of calling the callback, effectively skipping the error handling for the async operation. This could lead to unexpected behavior and make it harder to find and fix issues.

DONE.
