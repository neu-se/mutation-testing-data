  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic would be inverted, and the function would return timezones even if they are deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(deprecated === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic would be inverted twice, and the function would return timezones even if they are not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic would be different, and the function would return timezones even if they are deprecated.

DONE.
