  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb === null` checks whether the `cb` argument is null, while `!cb` checks whether `cb` is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, NaN, 0, or an empty string).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof cb === 'function'` checks whether `cb` is a function, while `!cb` checks whether `cb` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.length > 0` checks whether the `cb` argument is a non-empty function, while `!cb` checks whether `cb` is falsy.

DONE.
