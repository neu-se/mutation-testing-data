  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the newOp to the end of the ops array, instead of inserting it at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp at the specified index, but it would also remove the existing op at that index, instead of replacing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing op at the specified index with the newOp, but it would not insert the newOp if there was no existing op at that index.

DONE.
