  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which is the argument passed to the `read` function. In the original code, `ended` is set to `end` if `end` is truthy, but in the mutated code, `ended` is set to the opposite of `end`. This could cause the function to behave differently in certain situations, such as if `end` is a boolean value.

DONE.
