  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + deg2rad(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of λ1 would cause the resulting longitude value to be offset from the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - deg2rad(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of λ1 would cause the resulting longitude value to be offset in the opposite direction of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * deg2rad(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by λ1 would cause the resulting longitude value to be scaled relative to the original value.

DONE.
