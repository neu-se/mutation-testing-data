  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "fulfilled") {
    return inspected.value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise only if it is fulfilled, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of the promise regardless of its state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "rejected") {
    return inspected.reason;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason of the promise only if it is rejected, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of the promise regardless of its state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "pending") {
    return inspected.value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise only if it is pending, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of the promise regardless of its state.
