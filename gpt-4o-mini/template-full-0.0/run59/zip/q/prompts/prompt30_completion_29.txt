Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element from the array instead of the last, which would change the order in which tasks are executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing the `length` property does not modify the array or retrieve a task, leading to no tasks being executed from the `laterQueue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing the first element of the array does not remove it, meaning the same task would be executed repeatedly without progressing through the queue.

DONE.
