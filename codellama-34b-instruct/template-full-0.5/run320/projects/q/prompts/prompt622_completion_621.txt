  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, potentially causing a different result to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `value` argument would be passed to the `set` method, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the value argument, potentially causing the `set` method to behave differently.

DONE.
