  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` is a function call, while `otherIter.peekType` is a property access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType + 1` is a different value than `otherIter.peekType()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType - 1` is a different value than `otherIter.peekType()`.

DONE.
