  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` would return the length of the current operation in the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` would return the length of the current operation in the `this` delta, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` would return the length of the next operation in the `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength() + thisIter.peekLength()` would return the sum of the lengths of the next operations in both deltas, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER
