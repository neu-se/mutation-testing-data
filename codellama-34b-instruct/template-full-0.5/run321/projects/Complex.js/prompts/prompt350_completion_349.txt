  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which is a simple variable reference, while the replaced code fragment is `a + 1`, which is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the function to behave differently when the value of `a` is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which is a simple variable reference, while the replaced code fragment is `b`, which is a different variable reference. This change would cause the function to behave differently when the value of `b` is not equal to the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which is a simple variable reference, while the replaced code fragment is `a * 2`, which is an expression that
