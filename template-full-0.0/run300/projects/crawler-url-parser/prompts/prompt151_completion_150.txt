  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` includes the port number, while `pageurl.hostname` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host == linkurl.host && pageurl.port == linkurl.port
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for equality of the port numbers, which may not be necessary or desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host == linkurl.host && pageurl.protocol == linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for equality of the protocols, which may not be necessary or desirable in all cases.

DONE.
