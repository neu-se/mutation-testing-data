  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `a` is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the sum of `a` and `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
