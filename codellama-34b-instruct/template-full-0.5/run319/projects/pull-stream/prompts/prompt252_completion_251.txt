  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `_read`, potentially causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `_read` would change its value, potentially causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `_read` to `null` would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called with a null value, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
