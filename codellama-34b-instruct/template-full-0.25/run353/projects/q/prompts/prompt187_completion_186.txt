  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with the first element being the string before the first occurrence of "at ", which would likely be the function name and file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace("at ", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the first occurrence of "at " from the string, which would likely change the function name and file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.slice(stackLine.indexOf("at ") + 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a substring starting from the index of the first occurrence of "at " plus 3 characters, which would likely be the function name and file path.

DONE.
