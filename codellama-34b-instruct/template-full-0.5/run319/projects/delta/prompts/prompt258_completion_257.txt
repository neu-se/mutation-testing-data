  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is not defined for the `thisOp` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
