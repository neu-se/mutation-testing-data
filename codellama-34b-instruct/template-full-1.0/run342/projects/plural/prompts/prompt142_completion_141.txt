  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule[0] instanceof String) && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `type` function to check if `rule[0]` is a string, while the replacement code fragment uses the `instanceof` operator, which checks if `rule[0]` is an instance of the `String` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule[0] is String) && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `type` function to check if `rule[0]` is a string, while the replacement code fragment uses the `is` operator, which checks if `rule[0]` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule[0].constructor === String) && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `type` function to check if `rule[
