 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation would cause the fallback function to always be used, even if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof fallback === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the type of fallback being undefined, rather than just checking for its existence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if fallback is equal to null, which might not be the case if fallback is undefined.

DONE.
