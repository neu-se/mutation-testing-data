  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || !priority)) {
  index += length;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize insertions over deletions, which could lead to incorrect offset calculations and transformed positions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (offset < index && nextType === 'insert') {
  index -= length;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not prioritize insertions over deletions, which could lead to incorrect offset calculations and transformed positions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || priority)) {
  index -= length;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prioritize insertions over deletions, which could lead to incorrect offset calculations and transformed positions.

DONE.
