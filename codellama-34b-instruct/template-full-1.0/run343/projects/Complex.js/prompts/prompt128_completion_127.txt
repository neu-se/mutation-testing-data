  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition is checking if the divisor is infinite, but replacing it with `isNaN(c)` would check if the divisor is NaN, which could cause different behavior if the divisor is actually NaN and not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(c === Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition is checking if the divisor is infinite, but replacing it with `!(c === Infinity)` would check if the divisor is not equal to Infinity, which could cause different behavior if the divisor is actually equal to Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the condition is checking if the divisor is infinite, but replacing it with `z['isFinite']()` would check if the
