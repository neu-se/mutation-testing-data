  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.race` is a function that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the first promise in an array of promises to be settled.

DONE.
