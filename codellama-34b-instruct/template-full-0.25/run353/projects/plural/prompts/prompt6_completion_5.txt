  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different method than `Object.prototype.valueOf`, which is called by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, which is called by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toLocaleString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, which is called by the original code fragment.

DONE.
