  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number `a + bi`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a - b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the difference of the squares of `a` and `b`, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number `a - bi`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b) / 2
```
This code fragment calculates half of the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number `a + bi` divided by 2.

DONE.
