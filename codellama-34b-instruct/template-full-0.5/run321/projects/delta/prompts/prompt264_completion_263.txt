  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to use the wrong attributes when comparing the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to use the wrong attributes when comparing the two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to use `null` instead of the correct attributes when comparing the two objects.

DONE.
