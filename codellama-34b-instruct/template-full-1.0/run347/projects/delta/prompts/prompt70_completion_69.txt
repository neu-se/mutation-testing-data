  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof attributes !== 'undefined' &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code ensures that `attributes` is not null, but the modified code only checks that it is not undefined. This could cause the code to produce different results when `attributes` is null, which could be a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks that `attributes` has at least one key, but the modified code checks that it has more than one key. This could cause the code to produce different results when `attributes` has only one key, which could be a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes
