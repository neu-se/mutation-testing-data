  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in the `while` loop only running once, because `length` is always evaluated to `1` and the loop condition is always `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the `while` loop never running, because the condition is always `false` and the loop body is never executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in the `while` loop running indefinitely, because `length` is always evaluated to `-1` and the condition is always `true`.

DONE.
