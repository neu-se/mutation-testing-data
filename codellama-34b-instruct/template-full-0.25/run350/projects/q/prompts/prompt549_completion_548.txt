  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.fail` is a method that is called when a promise is rejected, whereas `result.done` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a property that contains the resolved value of a promise, whereas `result.done` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.isRejected` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether a promise is rejected, whereas `result.done` is a method that is called when a promise is resolved.

DONE.
