  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none()
```
This would result in different behavior because `none()` is not a function in the code, and it would cause a crash or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `all()` is a function in the code, but it is not the correct function to use in this context. It would not cause an error, but it would not provide the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
first()
```
This would result in different behavior because `first()` is a function in the code, but it is not the correct function to use in this context. It would not cause an error, but it would not provide the expected result.

DONE.
