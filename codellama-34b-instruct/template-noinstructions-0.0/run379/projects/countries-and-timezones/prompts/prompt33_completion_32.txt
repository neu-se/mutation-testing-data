  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round the minutes down to the nearest hour, whereas the original code fragment rounds the minutes to the nearest minute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round the minutes up to the nearest hour, whereas the original code fragment rounds the minutes to the nearest minute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round the minutes to the nearest hour, whereas the original code fragment rounds the minutes to the nearest minute.

DONE.
