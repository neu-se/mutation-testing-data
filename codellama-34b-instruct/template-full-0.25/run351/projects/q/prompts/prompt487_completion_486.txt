  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledRejections` array to an empty array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove any rejections from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledReasons` array to an empty array, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to not add any reasons to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to `false`, which would cause the `trackRejection` and `untrackRejection` functions to not add or remove any rejections from the `unhandledRejections` array.
