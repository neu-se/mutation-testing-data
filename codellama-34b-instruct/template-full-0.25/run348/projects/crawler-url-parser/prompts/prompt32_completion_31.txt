  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while the replacement code uses 'https://' which would result in a different protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while the replacement code uses 'http://www.' which would result in a different domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while the replacement code uses 'http://localhost' which would result in a different domain.

DONE.
