  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the base URL to all capital letters, which could result in a different URL being parsed and potentially a different set of results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would change the protocol of the base URL to HTTPS, which could result in a different URL being parsed and potentially a different set of results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + '?query=value'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate a query string to the end of the base URL, which could result in a different URL being parsed and potentially a different set of results.

DONE.
