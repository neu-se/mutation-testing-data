  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, whereas `exec` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches, whereas `exec` returns an array of matches and the index of the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the index of the first match, whereas `exec` returns an array of matches and the index of the match.

DONE.
