  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, which may not be the same as the type of the operation that is being peeked at.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, which may not be the same as the length of the operation that is being peeked at.

DONE.
