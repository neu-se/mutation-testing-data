  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the compression level is not equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression > COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code fragment checks if it is greater than `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `
