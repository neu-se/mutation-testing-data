  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.endsWith('/') && string.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `string.startsWith('/')` check would cause the code to only match strings that start with a forward slash, whereas the original code would match any string that ends with a forward slash.

DONE.
