  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the variable `definition` to `0`, which would likely cause the code that uses it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the variable `definition` to `false`, which would likely cause the code that uses it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the variable `definition` to the string "undefined", which would likely cause the code that uses it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
