 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.process.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event at the global process level instead of the current instance of Dirty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('invalid_event')
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an 'invalid\_event' that is not handled by the Dirty class, and therefore, would not trigger any expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event on the `_writeStream` object instead of triggering the 'drain' event handler function in the Dirty class.

DONE.
