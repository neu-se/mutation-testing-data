  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "e", while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "i".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'o') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "e", while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'u') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of
