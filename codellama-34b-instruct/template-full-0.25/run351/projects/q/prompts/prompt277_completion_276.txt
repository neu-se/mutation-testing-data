  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different number of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different number of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different number of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the promise.

DONE.
