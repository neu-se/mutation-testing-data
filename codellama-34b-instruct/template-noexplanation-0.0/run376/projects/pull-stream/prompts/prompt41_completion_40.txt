  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This change will cause the `pull` function to be called with the `this` context set to `null`, which may result in unexpected behavior if the function relies on the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This change will cause the `pull` function to be bound to a specific context, which may result in unexpected behavior if the function relies on the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This change will cause the `pull` function to be called with the `this` context set to `null` and the arguments set to the elements of the `ref` array, which may result in unexpected behavior if the function relies on the `this` context or the arguments.

DONE.
