  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '*'
```
This code fragment will cause the glob pattern to match all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '?'
```
This code fragment will cause the glob pattern to match all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, but it will also match any file that has a name that starts with the same characters as the glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '**'
```
This code fragment will cause the glob pattern to match all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, but it will also match any file that has a name that starts with the same characters as the glob pattern, and it will also match any file that is in a subdirectory of the current directory.

DONE.
