  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is used to retrieve a country from the `data` object, and adding 1 to it would cause the function to return a different country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is used to retrieve a country from the `data` object, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the function to return a different country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is used to retrieve a country from the `data` object, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the function to return a different country.

DONE.
