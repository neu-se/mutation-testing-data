  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, and the `error` event would be emitted instead, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, and the `close` event would be emitted instead, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, and the `drain` event would be emitted instead, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
