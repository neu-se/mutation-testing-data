  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2.longitude` is a different value than `point2.latitude`, and would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `point2.latitude` would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random() * point2.latitude` would return a random value between 0 and `point2.latitude`, and would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different result.

DONE.
