 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'isNaN' function checks if the value is not a number, but here it is used to check if the imaginary part is exactly equal to the Not-a-Number value, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] > 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is greater than 1000, instead of checking if the complex number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Number.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because 'Number.NaN' is a read-only property representing the Not-a-Number value, but it is not used to check if a complex number is not a number.

In conclusion, the PLACEHOLDER should be replaced with a proper check for Na
