  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument passed to the function, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the last argument passed to the function, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra argument at the end of the argument list, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
