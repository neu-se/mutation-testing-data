  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `parse` method to not parse the query string, which could result in different URLs being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `parse` method to not parse the path, which could result in different URLs being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `false` parameters would cause the `parse` method to not parse the query string or the path, which could result in different URLs being generated.

DONE.
