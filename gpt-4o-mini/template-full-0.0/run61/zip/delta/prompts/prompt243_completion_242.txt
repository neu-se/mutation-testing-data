Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the first 0 characters, effectively making the delete operation a no-op, which could lead to incorrect results when comparing the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more character than available, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or unexpected behavior in the delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than the current length of the operation, which could lead to incorrect state in the delta and potentially cause data loss or corruption in the resulting delta.

DONE.
