 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a constant `GeoPoint` with latitude 0 and longitude 0, instead of calculating the distance to the provided point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
