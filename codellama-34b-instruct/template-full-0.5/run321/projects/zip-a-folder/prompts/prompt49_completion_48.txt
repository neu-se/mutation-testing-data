  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the archive to be created with different settings or options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a null argument, which could cause the archive to be created with different settings or options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with an undefined argument, which could cause the archive to be created with different settings or options.

DONE.
