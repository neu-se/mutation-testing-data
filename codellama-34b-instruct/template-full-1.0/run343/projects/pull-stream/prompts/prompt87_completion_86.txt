  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb || !test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!cb) || !test`, which is always true if `cb` is not a function or `test` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(cb && test) || !cb`, which is always true if `cb` and `test` are both truthy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than `&&`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(cb || test) && !cb`, which is always true if `cb` or `test` is a truthy value and `cb` is a
