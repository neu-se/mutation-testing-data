  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory, while `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync(file, options)` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory, while `fs.readFile(file, options)` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync(file, options).toString()` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory and then converts it to a string,
