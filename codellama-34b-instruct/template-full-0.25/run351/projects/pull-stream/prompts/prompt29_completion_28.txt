  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the value at that index may be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value at the index is different, and the addition of 1 may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value at the index is different, and the multiplication by 2 may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
