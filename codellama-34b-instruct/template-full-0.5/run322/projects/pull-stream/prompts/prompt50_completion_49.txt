  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is a function, while this replacement checks if `s` is not a function. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is a function using the `typeof` operator, while this replacement checks if `s` is a function using the `constructor` property. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is a function using the `typeof` operator, while this replacement checks if `s` is a function using the
