  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` is a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

DONE.
