  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `!Number.isFinite` checks if a value is not a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), while `!Number.isFinite` checks if a value is not a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if a value is a safe integer, while `!Number.isFinite` checks if a value is not a finite number.

DONE.
