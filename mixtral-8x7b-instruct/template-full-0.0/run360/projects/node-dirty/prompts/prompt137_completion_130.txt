 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.has` checks if a key exists in the map, but it doesn't return the value associated with the key. The original code fragment `this._data.get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
