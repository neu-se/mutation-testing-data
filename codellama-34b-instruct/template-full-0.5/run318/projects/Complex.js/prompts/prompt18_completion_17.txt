  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `b`, which is a different operation than multiplying `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `b`, which is a different operation than multiplying `a` and `-b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `b`, which is a different operation than adding `a` and `b`.

DONE.
