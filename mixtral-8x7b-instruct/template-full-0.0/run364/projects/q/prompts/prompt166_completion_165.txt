 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the loop variable instead of incrementing it, which can change the order of iteration and potentially skip or repeat elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always increments the loop variable by 2, which can skip every other element and potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of incrementing the loop variable, which can cause the loop to terminate early or run indefinitely, depending on the random value generated.

DONE.
