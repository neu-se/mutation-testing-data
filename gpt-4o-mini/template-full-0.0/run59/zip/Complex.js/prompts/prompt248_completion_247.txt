Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the real part of the complex exponent without subtracting 1, which changes the expected output of the `expm1` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) * Math.cos(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the result, which is not the intended behavior of the `expm1` function that should subtract 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine function instead of the cosine function for the real part, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex exponent.

DONE.
