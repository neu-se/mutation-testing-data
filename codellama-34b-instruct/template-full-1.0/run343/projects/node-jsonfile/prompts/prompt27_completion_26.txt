  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, "xyz"
```
This would result in different behavior because another argument is passed to the `JSON.parse()` function, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver | (x => x * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is modified to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, x => "abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is modified to return a different value.

DONE.
