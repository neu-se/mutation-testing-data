  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `tap` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, while `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the original value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `tap` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, while `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the original value of the promise. In this case, the callback function returns the original promise, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw new Error("error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `tap` is a method that returns a new promise
