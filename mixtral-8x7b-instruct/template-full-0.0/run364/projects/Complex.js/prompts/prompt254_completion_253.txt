 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp` raises e to the power of the input, while `Math.exp(2)` always raises e to the power of 2, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp` raises e to the power of the input, while `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(Math.E, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.exp` raises e to the power of the input, while `Math.pow(Math.E, a)` raises e to the power of the variable `a`, which may not always be the same as the input.

DONE.
