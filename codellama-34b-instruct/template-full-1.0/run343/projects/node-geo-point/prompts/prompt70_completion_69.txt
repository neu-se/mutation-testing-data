  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ - 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original formula calculates the angle between two points in a clockwise direction, while this modified formula calculates the angle in a counterclockwise direction. As a result, the bearing calculation would return a different value, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original formula calculates the angle between two points in a clockwise direction, while this modified formula calculates the angle in a counterclockwise direction. As a result, the bearing calculation would return a different value, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(θ) * Math.cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original formula uses the sine and cosine functions to calculate the bearing, while this modified formula
