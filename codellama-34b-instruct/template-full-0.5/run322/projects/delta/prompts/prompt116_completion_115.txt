  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be initialized to 0, and the predicate function would not be used to determine the value of the accumulator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be initialized to 0, and the predicate function would not be used to determine the value of the accumulator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum * curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be initialized to 0, and the predicate function would not be used to determine the value of the accumulator.

DONE.
