  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is checking for the specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same as the original code, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be the same as the original code, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

DONE.
