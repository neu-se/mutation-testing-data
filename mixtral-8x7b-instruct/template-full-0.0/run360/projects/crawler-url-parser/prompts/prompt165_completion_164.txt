 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `path` property of the `pageurl` object instead of using the `pageurl_path` variable. This change could cause issues if the `pageurl` object doesn't have a `path` property or if its value is different from the `pageurl_path` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `pageurl_path` string using the `slice()` method. This change could cause issues if the original `pageurl_path` string is modified later in the code, but the copied string remains unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `pageurl_path` string to lowercase using the
