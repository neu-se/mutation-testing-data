  Sure, here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+1` would cause the `substr` function to return one more character than the original code, potentially leading to a different set of retained characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*2` would cause the `substr` function to return twice as many characters as the original code, potentially leading to a different set of retained characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length % 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `%2` would cause the `substr` function to return only the characters that are at even indices, potentially leading to a different set of retained characters.

DONE.
