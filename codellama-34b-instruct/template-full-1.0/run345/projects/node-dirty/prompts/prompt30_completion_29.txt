  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `undefined` key instead of the value associated with the `key` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `null` key instead of the value associated with the `key` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key `1` instead of the value associated with the `key` argument.

DONE.
