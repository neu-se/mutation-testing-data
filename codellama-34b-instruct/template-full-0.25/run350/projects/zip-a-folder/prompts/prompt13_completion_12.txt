  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string "src" with the number 1, resulting in the string "src1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the string "src" by 2, resulting in the string "srcsrc".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property would return the length of the string "src", which is 3.

DONE.
