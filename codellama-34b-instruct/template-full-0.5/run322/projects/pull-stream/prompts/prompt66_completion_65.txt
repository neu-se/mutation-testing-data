  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `end` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks whether `end` is loosely equal to `true`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when `end` is a non-boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `end` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks whether `end` is not strictly equal to `true`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when `end` is a non-boolean value.
