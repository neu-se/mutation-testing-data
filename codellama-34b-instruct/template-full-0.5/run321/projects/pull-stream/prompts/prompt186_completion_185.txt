  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `false`, even if the `array` parameter is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the value of the `array` parameter at the current index, rather than the value of the `array` parameter at the next index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the value of the `array` parameter at the previous index, rather than the value of the `array` parameter at the current index.

DONE.
