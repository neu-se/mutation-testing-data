  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `null` if the regular expression does not match the input string, and the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `undefined` if the regular expression does not match the input string, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns `undefined` if the regular expression does not match the input string, and the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality.

DONE.
