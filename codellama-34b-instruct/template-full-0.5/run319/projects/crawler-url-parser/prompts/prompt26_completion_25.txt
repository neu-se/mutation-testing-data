  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the hash and everything after it from the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the hash being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the hash and everything after it with a question mark, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the hash being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '$&'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the hash and everything after it with the entire matched string, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the hash being present.

DONE.
