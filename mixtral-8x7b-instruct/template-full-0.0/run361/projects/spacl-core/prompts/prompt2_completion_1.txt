 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp(spec).exec(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` returns the first match of the regex in the input string, while `match` returns all matches. In this case, if the `spec` contains a regex with a global flag, `match` will return all matches, but `exec` will only return the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match of the regex in the input string, while `match` returns the matches. In this case, if the `spec` contains a regex with a global flag, `match` will return all matches, but `search` will only return the index of the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]/)
```
