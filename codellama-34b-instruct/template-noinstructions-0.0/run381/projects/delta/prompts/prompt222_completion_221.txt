  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the wrong strings, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the wrong strings, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be comparing the wrong strings, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
