  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `===` checks for both value and type equality, whereas `==` only checks for value equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `!==` checks for both value and type inequality, whereas `!=` only checks for value inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object, and `length` is a property of the object, not the object itself.

DONE.
