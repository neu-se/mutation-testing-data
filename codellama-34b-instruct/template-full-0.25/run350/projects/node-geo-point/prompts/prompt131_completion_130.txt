  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would use a different zoom level than the original code, which could affect the resulting tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would use a different zoom level than the original code, which could affect the resulting tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would use a different zoom level than the original code, which could affect the resulting tile coordinates.

DONE.
