  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the string "promise" as an argument, rather than the expected function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the string "Q" as an argument, rather than the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the string "undefined" as an argument, rather than the expected function.

DONE.
