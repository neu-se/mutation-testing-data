  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different regular expression pattern and a different replacement function. The new pattern would match words that end in "o" and the replacement function would return the word with "es" appended to the end, while the original pattern matches words that end in "o" and the replacement function returns the word with "s" appended to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a different regular expression pattern and a different replacement function. The new pattern would match words that end in "o" and the replacement function would return the word with "ies"
