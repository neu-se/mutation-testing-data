Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return `{ retain: Infinity }` when the index is out of bounds, instead of returning the next operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the iterator's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat a `null` operation as a valid condition to skip processing, which could lead to unexpected results when the operations array contains `null` values, causing the method to return `{ retain: Infinity }` instead of processing the next valid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly trigger the condition to return `{ retain: Infinity }` when a negative length is provided, which is not a valid scenario for the `next` method, leading to incorrect behavior in the iterator's operation handling.

DONE.
