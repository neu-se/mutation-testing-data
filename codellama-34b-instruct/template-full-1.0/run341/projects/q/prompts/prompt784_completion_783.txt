  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject()` will always reject the promise, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected. This would cause the test suite to fail, as the expected behavior is for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for a promise. This would cause the test suite to fail, as the expected behavior is for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for a promise. This would cause the test suite to fail, as the expected behavior is for the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
