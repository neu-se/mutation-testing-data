  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, and if so, it is pushing the first element of `other.ops` to `delta.ops`. If `other.ops.length` is 0, it would push `undefined` to `delta.ops`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `other.ops.length` is greater than 0, and if so, it is pushing the first element of `other.ops` to `delta.ops`. If `other.ops.length` is -1, it would push the last element of `other.ops` to `delta.ops`, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `other
