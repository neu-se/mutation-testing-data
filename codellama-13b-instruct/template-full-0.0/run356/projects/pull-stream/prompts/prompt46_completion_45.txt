  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, since the condition `i < length` would be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one more time than the original code, since the condition `i < length` would be true for one more iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one less time than the original code, since the condition `i < length` would be false for one iteration.

DONE.
