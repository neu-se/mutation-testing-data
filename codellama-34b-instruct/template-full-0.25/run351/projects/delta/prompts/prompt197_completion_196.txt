  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is set to 0, which would cause the `retain` operation to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is set to a negative value, which would cause the `retain` operation to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is set to `null`, which would cause the `retain` operation to be skipped.

DONE.
