  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(reason) {
    untrackRejection(promise);
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally untrack the rejection, regardless of whether it has been handled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(reason) {
    return reason;
}).then(untrackRejection(promise));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally untrack the rejection, regardless of whether it has been handled or not, and it would also execute the `untrackRejection` function immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(reason) {
    if (reason instanceof Error) {
        untrackRejection(promise);
    }
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it
