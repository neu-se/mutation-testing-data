  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` is a method that returns a function that wraps a NodeJS-style callback function in a promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a method that returns a function that wraps a NodeJS-style callback function in a promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

DONE.
