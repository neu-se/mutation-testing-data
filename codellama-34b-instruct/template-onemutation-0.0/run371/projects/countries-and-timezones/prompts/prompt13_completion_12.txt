  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the `current` array, even if it was already present, and it would always add the current timezone to the `all` array, even if it was already present.

DONE.
