  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `a` variable, which would change the resulting angle and potentially cause errors in the calculation of the complex number's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting angle and potentially cause errors in the calculation of the complex number's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the `a` variable, which would change the resulting angle and potentially cause errors in the calculation of the complex number's properties.

DONE.
