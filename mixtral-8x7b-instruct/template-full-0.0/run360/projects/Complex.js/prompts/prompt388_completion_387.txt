 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior when `a` is 0, making it undefined instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2) * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the scale of the result, affecting the magnitude of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the imaginary part to the real part, changing the complex number's representation.

DONE.
