  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because `channel.port1.onmessage` would be set to the return value of `flush()`, which is `undefined`, instead of the `flush` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function() { return flush(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because `channel.port1.onmessage` would be set to a function that returns the return value of `flush()`, which is `undefined`, instead of the `flush` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function() { flush(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because `channel.port1.onmessage` would be set to a function that calls `flush()`, but does not return its return value, which could cause the `setImmediate` function to not work as expected.

DONE.
