 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new empty array, whereas the original code uses an array with a single key, which might cause issues if the key is expected to be truthy or used in further operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to null, which might cause issues if the code expects an array-like object or if any array methods are called on the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to an empty object, which might cause issues if the code expects an array-like object or if any array methods are called on the result.

DONE.
