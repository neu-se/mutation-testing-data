  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index], index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `index` variable, which is used to access the array elements, resulting in different values being passed to the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index] + 1, index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `index` variable, which is used to access the array elements, resulting in different values being passed to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index] * 2, index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `this[index]` by 2, which would result in different values being passed to the `callback` function.

DONE.
