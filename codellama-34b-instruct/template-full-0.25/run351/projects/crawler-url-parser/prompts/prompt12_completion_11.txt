  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` protocol, while the replacement code fragment uses the `https` protocol. This could cause the URL parsing to behave differently, especially if the URL being parsed contains a protocol-relative URL (e.g. `//example.com`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` protocol, while the replacement code fragment uses the `http` protocol with a specific hostname (`example.com`). This could cause the URL parsing to behave differently, especially if the URL being parsed contains a different hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` protocol, while the replacement code fragment uses the `https` protocol with a specific hostname (`example.com`). This
