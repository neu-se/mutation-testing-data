Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the value of `end`, causing the callback to be invoked with `true` when `end` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the callback would lead to unexpected results, as it does not match the expected type of the `end` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the boolean value of `end` with a numeric constant, which may lead to incorrect handling in the callback logic, as it does not represent a valid state for `end`.

DONE.
