  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `err` and `data`, while `null` is a constant value that is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `err` and `data`, while `undefined` is a constant value that is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `err` and `data`, while `function() {}` is a different function that is called with no arguments.

DONE.
