 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the native Array.prototype.slice method, while `array_slice` is an alias used in the provided code. Changing it could cause issues if the code relies on the non-standard `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and attempting to call it would throw a TypeError. This would expose potential issues in error handling within the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.slice` does not exist in the provided code. Attempting to call it would throw a TypeError, exposing potential issues in error handling within the test suite.

DONE.
