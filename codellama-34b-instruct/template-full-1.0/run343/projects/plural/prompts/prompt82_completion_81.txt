  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[mouse, 'mice']```
This would result in different behavior because 'mouse' is a single noun and not a plural noun, so it would not fit the associated trigger rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```":{"mouse", "mice"]}```
This would result in different behavior because of the incorrect placement of the '{' character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```[(mouse, 'mice')]```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are unnecessary and argument is already passed in the function.

DONE.
