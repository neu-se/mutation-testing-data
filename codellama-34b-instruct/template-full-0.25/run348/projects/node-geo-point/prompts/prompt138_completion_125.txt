  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the correct values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would always be zero, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the correct values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be a random number, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the correct values.

DONE.
