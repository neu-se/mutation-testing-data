  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if both are infinite. This would cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` in cases where the original code would have returned `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if either `this`, `z`, or `this` is zero. This would cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` in cases where the original code would have returned `Complex['NAN']`, and also in cases where `this` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACE
