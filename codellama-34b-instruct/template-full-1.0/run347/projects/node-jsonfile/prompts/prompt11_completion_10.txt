  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse a null value, while the original code would parse a null value as an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse an empty string, while the original code would parse an empty string as an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse the number 0, while the original code would parse 0 as an empty object.

DONE.
