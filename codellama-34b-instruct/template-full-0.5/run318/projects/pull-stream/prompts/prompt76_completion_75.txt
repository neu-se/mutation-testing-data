  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `abort && true` expression would be evaluated first, and the result of that expression would be used as the first argument to the `read` function. In the original code, the `abort || true` expression is used as the first argument, which has a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `abort || false` expression would be evaluated first, and the result of that expression would be used as the first argument to the `read` function. In the original code, the `abort && true` expression is used as the first argument, which has a different behavior.
