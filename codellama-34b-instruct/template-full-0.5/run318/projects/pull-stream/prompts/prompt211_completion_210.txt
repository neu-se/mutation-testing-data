  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a reference to the `aborted` variable, which is defined as a boolean value. Replacing it with `null` would change the type of the value, which could potentially cause errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a reference to the `aborted` variable, which is defined as a boolean value. Replacing it with `undefined` would change the type of the value, which could potentially cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a reference to the `aborted` variable, which is defined as a boolean value. Replacing it with `false` would change the value of the variable, which could potentially cause errors in the code.
