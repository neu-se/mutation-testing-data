  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different replacement pattern, and could potentially cause the regex to match different substrings in the `pageurl` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\<'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different replacement pattern, and could potentially cause the regex to match different substrings in the `pageurl` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'///'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different replacement pattern, and could potentially cause the regex to match different substrings in the `pageurl` string.

DONE.
