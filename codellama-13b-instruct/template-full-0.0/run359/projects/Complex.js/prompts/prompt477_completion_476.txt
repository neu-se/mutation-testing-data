  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the real part of the complex number would change the result of the `isFinite` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the real part of the complex number would change the result of the `isFinite` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be used instead of the real part, which would change the result of the `isFinite` method.

DONE.
