Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `process.toString()` invokes the method and returns a string representation, which would be `"[object process]"`, but it could potentially throw an error if `process` is not defined or if the method is not available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.version
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing `process.version` retrieves the Node.js version as a string, which would not match `"[object process]"`, leading to the `isNodeJS` check failing in environments where the version is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.env` is an object containing environment variables, which would not return a string representation like `"[object process]"`, causing the `isNodeJS` check to fail.

DONE.
