  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, so this replacement would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not defined in the original code, so this replacement would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, so this replacement would cause a reference error.

DONE.
