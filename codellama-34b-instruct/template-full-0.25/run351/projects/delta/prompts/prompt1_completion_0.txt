  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` would only be true if `a` is null, whereas `typeof a !== 'object'` would be true for any value that is not an object, including null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` would only be true if `a` is undefined, whereas `typeof a !== 'object'` would be true for any value that is not an object, including undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null || a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null || a === undefined` would only be true if `a` is null or undefined, whereas `typeof a !== 'object'` would be true for any value that is not an object, including null and undefined.

DONE.
