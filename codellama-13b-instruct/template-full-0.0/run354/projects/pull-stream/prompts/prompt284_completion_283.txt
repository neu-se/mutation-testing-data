  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `try` block would not be executed, and the `catch` block would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `try` block would not be executed, and the `catch` block would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `try` block would not be executed, and the `catch` block would be triggered.

DONE.
