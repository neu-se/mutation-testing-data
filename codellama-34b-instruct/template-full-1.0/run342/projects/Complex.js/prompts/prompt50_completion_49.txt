  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` changes the arithmetic operation and could cause the method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` changes the arithmetic operation and could cause the method to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` changes the arithmetic operation and could cause the method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
