  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which is the argument passed to the function. In the original code, `ended` is set to `end` if `end` is truthy, but in the mutated code, `ended` is set to the opposite of `end`. This could cause the function to behave differently in certain cases, such as when `end` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
