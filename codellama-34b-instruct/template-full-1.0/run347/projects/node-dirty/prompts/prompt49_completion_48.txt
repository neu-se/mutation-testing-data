  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be trying to reference the `key` property of the `updater` function, which does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater.call(this, this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calling the `updater` function with the value of `key` as its parameter, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calling the `updater` function with the value stored in the `_data` Map under the `key` property, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
