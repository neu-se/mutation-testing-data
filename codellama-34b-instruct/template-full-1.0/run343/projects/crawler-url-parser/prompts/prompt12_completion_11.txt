  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'what is this sorcery'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid protocol for a URL, while the new fragment is nonsensical and would cause the `parse` method to fail.
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://1.2.3.4'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid protocol for a URL, while the new fragment is a valid IP address but not a valid domain name, which would cause the `parse` method to fail.
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid protocol for a URL, while the new fragment is a different protocol and would cause the `parse` method to fail.

DONE.
