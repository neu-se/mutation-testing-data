  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w + 'es'
```
 This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the string 'es', regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace('es', 's')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always replace 'es' with 's', regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace(/(y|x|ch|s)$/i, function(str, regex) { return regex.substr(0, 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would replace the ending of the word with 'ies' if it ends with 'y', 'x', 'ch', or 's'.

DONE.
