  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an object in JavaScript, and `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would produce a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, -1)` would produce a new array containing only the last element of `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)` would produce a new array containing only the first two elements of `arguments` starting from the second element.

DONE.
