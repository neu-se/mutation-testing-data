  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which means that it will return `true` if the operand is `false`, and `false` if the operand is `true`. In the original code, the `!cb` expression is checking if the `cb` function is not defined, but in the mutated code, the `!test` expression is checking if the `test` function is not defined, which is a different check.
