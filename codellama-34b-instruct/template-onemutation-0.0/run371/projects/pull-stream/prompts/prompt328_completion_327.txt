  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator checks if the `end` variable is falsy, while the `end` variable itself checks if the `end` event has been emitted. Using `end` instead of `!end` would cause the `op` function to be called even if the `end` event has been emitted, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the stream.

DONE.
