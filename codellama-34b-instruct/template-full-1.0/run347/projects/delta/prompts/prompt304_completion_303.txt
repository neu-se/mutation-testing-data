  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return basisIter.next() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the return value of `next()` by 1, which would cause the `forEach()` loop to access and modify the wrong elements in the `delta.ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return basisIter.next() * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the return value of `next()` by 2, which would cause the `forEach()` loop to access and modify every other element in the `delta.ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return basisIter.next().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the length of the return value of `next()`, which would cause the `forEach()` loop to iterate over the characters in the strings instead of the elements in the `delta.ops` array.

DONE.
