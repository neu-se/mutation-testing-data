  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undef, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undef` is not a valid argument to `nodeback`, but `null` is, and the resulting error would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, and the resulting error would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because only one argument is passed to `nodeback`, but it expects two. The resulting error would be different.

DONE.
