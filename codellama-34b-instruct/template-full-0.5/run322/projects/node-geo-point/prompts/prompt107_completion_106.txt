  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the x coordinate would be incorrect, leading to a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the y coordinate would be incorrect, leading to a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the x and y coordinates would be incorrect, leading to a different tile being returned.

DONE.
