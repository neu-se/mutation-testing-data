  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is the exact opposite of `true`, meaning that the function `nonUnique` will now always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not. This would break the functionality of the function and demonstrate that the test suite is not fully covering all possible cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true == false` expression always evaluates to `false`, regardless of the value of the `unique` function. This would cause the function `nonUnique` to always return `false`, which would be different from the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1 == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 + 1 == 2` expression always evaluates to `true`, regardless of the value of the `unique` function. This would
