  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is equal to 1, but the replaced code fragment always evaluates to 0, which means the `if` statement will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is equal to 1, but the replaced code fragment always evaluates to -1, which means the `if` statement will always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is equal to 1, but the replaced code fragment checks whether `a` plus 1 is equal to 0, which is a different condition.

DONE.
