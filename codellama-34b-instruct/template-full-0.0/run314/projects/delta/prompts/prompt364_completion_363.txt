  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion, while this replacement checks if the next operation is not an insertion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the next operation in the this delta is greater than the length of the next operation in the other delta, while this replacement checks if the length of the next operation in the this delta is greater than or equal to the length of the next operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the this delta is an insertion and the next operation in
