  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different values for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different values for the same input, and `tan` is not commutative with `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different values for the same input.

DONE.
