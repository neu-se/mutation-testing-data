  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack frame is internal to Q, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack frame is from Node.js.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if a value is promise-like, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack frame is from Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_defineProperty` is a different function that defines a property on an object, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack frame is from Node.js.

DONE.
