  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the `rejected` function as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `void 0` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`.

DONE.
