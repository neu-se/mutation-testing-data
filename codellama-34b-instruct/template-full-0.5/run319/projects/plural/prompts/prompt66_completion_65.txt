  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call that adds a rule to the pluralization rules, while this code fragment is a function call that adds a rule to the singularization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memoes')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call that adds a rule to the pluralization rules, while this code fragment is a function call that adds a rule to the singularization rules with a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos', true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call that adds a rule to the pluralization rules, while this code fragment is a function call that adds a rule to the pluralization rules with a different third argument (the "force" argument
