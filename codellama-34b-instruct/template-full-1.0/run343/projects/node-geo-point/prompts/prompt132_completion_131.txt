  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` parameter is increased by one, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` parameter is decreased by one, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.fromLngLatArray([this.longitude, this.latitude]), zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint.fromLngLatArray` function is called with the longitude and latitude reversed, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile.

DONE.
