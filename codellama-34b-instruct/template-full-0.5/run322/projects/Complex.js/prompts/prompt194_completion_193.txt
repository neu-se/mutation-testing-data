  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `a` and `z['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `b` and `z['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `a` and `z['im']`.

DONE.
