  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, deferred.reject, deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different, which could cause the promise to be notified or rejected when it should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify, deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the end of the list, which could cause the promise to be rejected twice.

DONE.
