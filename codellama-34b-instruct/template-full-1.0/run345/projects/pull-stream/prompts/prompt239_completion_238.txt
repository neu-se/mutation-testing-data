  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 NULL
```
This would result in different behavior because the tester function would receive null instead of the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the tester function would receive undefined instead of the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the tester function would receive NaN instead of the expected data.

DONE.
