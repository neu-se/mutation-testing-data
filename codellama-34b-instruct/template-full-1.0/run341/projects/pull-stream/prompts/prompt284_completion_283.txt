  Sure! Here are three possible answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `data` to `cb`, but this replacement code fragment passes `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `data` to `cb`, but this replacement code fragment passes `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `end` to `cb`, but this replacement code fragment passes `abort`.

DONE.
