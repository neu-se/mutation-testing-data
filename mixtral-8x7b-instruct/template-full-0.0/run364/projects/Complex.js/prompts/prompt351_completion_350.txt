 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when the input is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would raise `e` to the power of the input instead of calculating the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine instead of the cosine.

DONE.
