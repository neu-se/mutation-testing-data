  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the element at the index `at`, which is the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the element at the index `at`, which is the behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than the element at the index `at`, which is the behavior of the original code.

DONE.
