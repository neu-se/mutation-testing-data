 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would receive `null` as its argument instead of an options object, possibly causing unexpected behavior or errors in the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect({state: 'custom'})
```
This would result in different behavior because an invalid `state` value would be provided to the `inspect` method, potentially causing the method to return incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect(this)
