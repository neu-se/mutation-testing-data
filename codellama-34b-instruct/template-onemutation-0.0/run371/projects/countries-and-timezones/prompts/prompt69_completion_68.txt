  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if the `timezones` object has a property with the given `name`, while the new code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if the property is `undefined`. If the property is not defined, the original code fragment would return `true`, while the new code fragment would return `false`.
