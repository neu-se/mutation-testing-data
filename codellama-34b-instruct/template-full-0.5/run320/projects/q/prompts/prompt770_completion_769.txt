  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises, but `undefined` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises that are all fulfilled, but `Promise.reject()` creates a promise that is rejected.

DONE.
