  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, progressListeners]
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners` is not a valid argument for the `promiseDispatch` method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, 'undefined']
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `promiseDispatch` is expected to be a function, but `'undefined'` is a string and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, 'isFulfilled']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is not a valid argument for the `promiseDispatch` method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
