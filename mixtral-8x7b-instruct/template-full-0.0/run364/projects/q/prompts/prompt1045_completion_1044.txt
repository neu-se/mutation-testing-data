 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return `undefined` instead of rejecting the promise with an error when there's no more value to get from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop when there's no more value to get from the queue, as it keeps resolving the same promise over and over again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to always return a new promise, even if there's no more value to get from the queue. This could cause issues if the caller is expecting the same promise to be returned, as it would break the contract of the `get` method.

DONE.
