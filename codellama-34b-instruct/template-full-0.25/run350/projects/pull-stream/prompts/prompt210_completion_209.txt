  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an error as its first argument, but `aborted` is not an error object. This would cause the function to be called with an invalid argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an error as its first argument, but `null` is not an error object. This would cause the function to be called with an invalid argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
