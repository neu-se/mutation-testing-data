  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `aborted` is `true`. This would cause the `cb(aborted)` call to be skipped, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
