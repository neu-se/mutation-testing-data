  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is being accessed with the `id` property, which is not the same as the `prop` function. This could cause the test to fail if the `prop` function is not properly mocked or stubbed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is being accessed with the `id` property, which is a function, and is being called with no arguments. This could cause the test to fail if the `prop` function is not properly mocked or stubbed, or if the `id` function is not properly implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.id(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` object is being accessed with the `id` property, which is a function, and is being called with the argument `1`. This could cause the test to fail
