  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object from the end instead of from the beginning, which could potentially return a different subset of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and slice the `arguments` object from the second argument instead of from the beginning, which could potentially return a different subset of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object from the beginning to half of its length instead of from the beginning to the end, which could potentially return a different subset of arguments.

DONE.
