 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(resolve => resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise is created instead of resolving the existing deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfill(new Value(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Value` object is created and resolved, instead of resolving the existing deferred promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve = function () {}
deferred.reject = function (reason) { deferred.promise.reject(reason) }
deferred.fulfill = function (value) { deferred.promise.reject('Fulfillment is not supported') }
deferred.notify = function (progress) { deferred.promise.notify(progress) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve`, `reject`, and `fulfill` methods are overridden, preventing
