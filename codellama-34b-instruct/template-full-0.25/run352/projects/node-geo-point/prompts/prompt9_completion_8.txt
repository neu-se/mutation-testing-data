  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator `+` would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of the value of `point.type`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of the value of `point.type`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of the value of `point.type`.

DONE.
