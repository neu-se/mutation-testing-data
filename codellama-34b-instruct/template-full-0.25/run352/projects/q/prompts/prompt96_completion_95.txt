  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var index = 0; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to execute one more time than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var index = 
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a different index, potentially causing the loop to execute a different number of times than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var index = length - 1; index >= 0; index--) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, potentially causing the loop to execute a different number of times than intended.

DONE.
