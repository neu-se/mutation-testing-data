  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would only contain the first argument passed to `dispatch`, rather than all of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would only contain the second argument passed to `dispatch`, rather than all of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would only contain the third argument passed to `dispatch`, rather than all of the arguments.

DONE.
