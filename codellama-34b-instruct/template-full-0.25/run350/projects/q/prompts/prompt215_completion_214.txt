  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.then()` is a promise that resolves to `value`, whereas `value` is a non-promise value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(value)` is a promise that resolves to `value`, whereas `value` is a non-promise value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(value)` is a promise that resolves to `value`, whereas `value` is a non-promise value.

DONE.
