  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 'people', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return the same output regardless of the input, since it always returns the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'people', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to add an extra unnecessary item to the `rules` array, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to return `null` as the plural form of "person", which could cause errors if the function is used in a context where a plural form is expected.

DONE.
