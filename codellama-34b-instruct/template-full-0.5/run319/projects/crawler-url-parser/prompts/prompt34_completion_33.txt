  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `URL.parse()` method to interpret the `currentUrlStr` as a host, which would result in a different URL object being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `queryString` parameter would cause the `URL.parse()` method to ignore any query string in the `currentUrlStr`, which would result in a different URL object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because both `slashesDenoteHost` and `queryString` parameters are set to `false`, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method to interpret the `
