 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `value` and `value.then` exist, but doesn't verify if `value.then` is a function. The original code uses `instanceof Promise` to ensure `value.then` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `value.then` is a function, but doesn't perform the correct behavior for thenables that are not Promises. The original code uses `instanceof Promise` to handle thenables correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && value.constructor.name === 'Promise'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor's name is 'Promise', which may not be reliable across different environments or when minification is used. The original code uses `
