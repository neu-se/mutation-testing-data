  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` keyword is used as a parameter to the `bind` method, which would cause an error to be thrown instead of the intended behavior of calling the `continuer` function with the `"throw"` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is passed as the second argument to the `bind` method, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `"throw"` argument and `undefined` as the second argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is passed as the second argument to the `bind` method,
