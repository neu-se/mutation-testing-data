  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior if there are any inherited properties on the array, as they would be missed by the comparison using `in`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior if the desired outcome is to iterate over a reduced set of array elements, as the modified code would iterate over additional elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === ' '.repeat(this.length)
```
This would result in different behavior if the goal is to perform string manipulation using the `repeat` method, rather than array iteration.

DONE.
