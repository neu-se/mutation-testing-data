  Sure, I can do that. Here are three options for each of the three functions:

### Option 1 for 'sin':
'sin' can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) * sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce the opposite of the intended result, with the cosine of `a` being multiplied by the hyperbolic sine of `b`.

### Option 2 for 'sin':
'sin' can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) * cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different expression, with the sine of `a` being multiplied by the cosine of `b`.

### Option 3 for 'sin':
'sin' can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b) * cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different expression, with the sine of `b` being multiplied by the cosine of `a`.

DONE.
