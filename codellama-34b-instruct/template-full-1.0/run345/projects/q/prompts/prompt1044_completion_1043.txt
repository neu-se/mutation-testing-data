  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` is used to retrieve the value of the promise, while `resolve()` is used to resolve the promise with a new value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` is used to retrieve the value of the promise, while `reject()` is used to reject the promise with a new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then(function(value) {
    return Q.resolve(value);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` is used to retrieve the value of the promise, while `then()` is used to chain the promise with a new value.

DONE.
