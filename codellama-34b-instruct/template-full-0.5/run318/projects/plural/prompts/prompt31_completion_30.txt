  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation starts from a different index, resulting in a different output for words like "thesis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation ends at a different index, resulting in a different output for words like "crisis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation ends at a different index, resulting in a different output for words like "thesis".

DONE.
