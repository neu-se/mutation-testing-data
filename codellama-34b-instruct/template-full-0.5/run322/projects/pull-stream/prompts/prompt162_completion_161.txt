  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to true, while the new code fragment `false` would always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to true, while the new code fragment `!value` would evaluate to true if `value` is falsy and false if `value` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to true, while the new code fragment `value === null` would evaluate to true if `value` is null and false otherwise.

DONE.
