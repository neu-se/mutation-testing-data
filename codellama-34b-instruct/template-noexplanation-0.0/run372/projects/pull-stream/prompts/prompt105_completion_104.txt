  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to receive `undefined` as its first argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to receive `0` as its first argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This change will cause the `drain` function to receive an empty string as its first argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when it receives `null`.

DONE.
