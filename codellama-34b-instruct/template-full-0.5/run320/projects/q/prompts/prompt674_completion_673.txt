  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which would not be the same as the original `this` context of the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would call the `dispatch` method with `this` as the `this` context, but it would not return a new function with the `this` context bound to `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would call the `dispatch` method with `this` as the `this` context, but it would not return a new function with the `this` context bound to `this`.

DONE.
