  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to ignore the case of the input string, so it would match both "ch" and "Ch", and "s" and "S".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gi` flags at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, regardless of case, and to ignore the case of the input string.
