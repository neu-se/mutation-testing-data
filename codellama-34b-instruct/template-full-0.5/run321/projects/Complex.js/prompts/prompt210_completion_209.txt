  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is less than or equal to zero, but the replaced code fragment is checking if `a` is greater than or equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is less than or equal to zero, but the replaced code fragment is checking if `b` is less than or equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is less than or equal to zero, but the replaced code fragment is checking if `a + b` is less than or equal to zero.

DONE.
