  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is short-circuiting, meaning that if the first operand is falsy, the second operand is not evaluated and the whole expression is falsy. Therefore, the `&&` operator would prevent the `predicate` function from being called, which could affect the outcome of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical negation operator, and it would invert the result of the `predicate` function. The `!predicate` expression would be `true` if `predicate` returns `false`, and it would be `false` if `predicate` returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is also the logical OR operator, but it would
