  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the entire stack trace, rather than starting from the current function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the first character of the stack trace, which could be important information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the first two characters of the stack trace, which could be important information.

DONE.
