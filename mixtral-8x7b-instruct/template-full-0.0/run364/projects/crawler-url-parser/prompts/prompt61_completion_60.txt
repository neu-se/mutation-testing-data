 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://' + parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.pathname + parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the 'http' protocol, whereas the original code uses the same protocol as the input URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` includes the fragment identifier (#), which might not be desired in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'//' + parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.pathname + parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses double slashes (`//`) instead of the protocol (http: or https:), which might cause issues in certain contexts.

DONE.
