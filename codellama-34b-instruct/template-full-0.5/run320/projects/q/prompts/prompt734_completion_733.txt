  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `[]` is an empty array. This would cause the `all` method to resolve immediately with an empty array, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `null` is a null value. This would cause the `all` method to reject immediately with a `TypeError`, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is an array of promises, while `new Error('foo')` is an error object. This would cause the `all` method to reject immediately with the error object, rather than waiting for the promises to settle.
