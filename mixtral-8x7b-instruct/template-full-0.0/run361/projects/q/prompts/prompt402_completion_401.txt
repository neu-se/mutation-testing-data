 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { /* do nothing */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would not reject the promise with the given reason, and instead, it would do nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would not reject the promise with the given reason, but instead, it would return the reason as the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would reject the promise with a new error object instead of the original reason. The new error object would have a message containing the original reason.

DONE.
