  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This could cause the `readFileSync` function to behave differently if the `options` argument is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is equal to `'utf8'`. This could cause the `readFileSync` function to behave differently if the `encoding` property is not equal to `'utf8'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding !== 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new
