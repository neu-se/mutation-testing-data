  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "node.js:" appears anywhere in the line, not just at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string "module.js:" appears anywhere in the line, not just at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("(node.js:") !== -1 || line.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either of the strings "node.js:" or "module.js:" appear anywhere in the line, not just at the beginning.

DONE.
