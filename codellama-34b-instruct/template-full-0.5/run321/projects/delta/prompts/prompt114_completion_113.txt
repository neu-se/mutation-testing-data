  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be updated with the index of the current element instead of the current element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be updated with the current element instead of the index of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + index + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the accumulator would be updated with the sum of the index of the current element and the current element itself.

DONE.
