  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is uncurried, meaning it takes all its arguments as a single array. However, `Array.prototype.slice` is not a function, so passing it to `uncurryThis` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.map)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.map` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new array with the results of calling that function on each element of the original array. However, `uncurryThis` would return a new function that takes an array as an argument and applies the original function to each element of the array, which is not the same as `Array.prototype.map`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
