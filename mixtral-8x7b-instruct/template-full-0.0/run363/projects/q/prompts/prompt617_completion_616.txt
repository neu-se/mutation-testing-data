 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the promise to always reject instead of correctly handling the "get" operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
symbol("get")
```
This would result in different behavior because `symbol("get")` creates a new symbol, which is different from the string `"get"`. The `dispatch` method expects a string, so it would not be able to handle the symbol correctly, causing the promise to always reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, "get", [key])
