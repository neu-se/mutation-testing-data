 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the index of '\n' from the beginning of the string instead of the end, potentially causing incorrect handling of chunk data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\\n') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a double backslash instead of a single one, which would not match the newline character, causing the condition to always be true and affecting the processing of chunk data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the buffer has any content, rather than checking if the last chunk processed had a newline character. This could lead to incorrect handling of chunk data and affect the overall functionality of the code.

DONE.
