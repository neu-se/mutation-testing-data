Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to slice the base array with an invalid range, potentially resulting in an empty slice or an error, rather than the intended slice of one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it shifts the slice range, effectively retrieving a different element from the base array than intended, which could lead to incorrect operations being performed on the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the slice length, potentially retrieving more elements than intended, which could lead to incorrect processing of the operations in the `invert` function.

DONE.
