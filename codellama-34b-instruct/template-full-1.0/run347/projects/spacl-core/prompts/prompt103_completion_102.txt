  My apologies for the confusion. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path, verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the path, which could cause the policy to return the incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, !ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the query context, which could cause the policy to return the incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"example.com", verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a hardcoded path instead of the actual path being used in the query.

DONE.
