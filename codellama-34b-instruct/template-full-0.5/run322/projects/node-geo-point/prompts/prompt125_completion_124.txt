  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(this.latitude - point.latitude) + Math.abs(this.longitude - point.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points, which is not the same as the Haversine distance used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the Euclidean distance between the two points, which is not the same as the Haversine distance used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 3) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 3));
```
