Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback to `err`, which would indicate an error condition, while the original code indicates a successful operation by passing `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument to `undefined`, which means that the callback would receive no valid data, whereas the original code passes the actual `data` received.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, passing `data` as the first argument instead of `null`, which would imply that there was an error (since the first argument is typically reserved for the error) and would confuse the callback's intended usage.

DONE.
