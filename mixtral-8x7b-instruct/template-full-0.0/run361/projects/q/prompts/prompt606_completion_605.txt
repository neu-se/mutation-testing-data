 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the successful resolution of the promise is replaced with its rejection, which could cause the test suite to fail if it does not properly handle rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is used to update the progress of a promise, and replacing `deferred.resolve` with it would cause the promise to be updated with a progress notification instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` returns the promise itself, which would cause an infinite recursion when the promise is resolved, as the `resolve` method would be called again and again.

DONE.
