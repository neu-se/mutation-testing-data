  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise-like object, while this replacement always returns true, indicating that the value is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise-like object, while this replacement always returns false, indicating that the value is not a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return !isPromiseAlike; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise-like object, while this replacement checks if the value is not a promise-like object.

DONE.
