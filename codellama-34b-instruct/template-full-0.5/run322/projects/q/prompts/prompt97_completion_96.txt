```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would terminate too early.

DONE.
