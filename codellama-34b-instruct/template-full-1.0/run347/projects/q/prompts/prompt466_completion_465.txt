  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atReport` variable, which contains the index of `promise` in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array. If `atReport` is not found in the array, it will be `-1`, and the code will not emit the `"rejectionHandled"` event.

By replacing `atReport` with `reportedUnhandledRejections.length`, the code will always emit the `"rejectionHandled"` event, regardless of whether `promise` is in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `at` variable, which contains the index of `promise` in the `unhandledRejections` array. If `at` is not found in the array, it will be `-1`, and the code will not
