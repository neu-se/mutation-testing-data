 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code block that checks if `options.dest` has an extension would not execute, and the `options.dest` value would not be updated with the decoded basename from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always evaluate to `true`, causing the code block that checks if `options.dest` has an extension to always execute, and potentially updating the `options.dest` value with the decoded basename from the URL even when it already has an extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on `options.url` instead of `options.dest`, potentially causing the code block that checks if `options.dest` has an extension to always execute, and potentially
