  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` value would be computed differently, potentially leading to a different value for `φ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const λ2 = λ1 + atan2(sinθ * sinδ * cosφ1, cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` value would be computed differently, potentially leading to a different value for `φ2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = asin(sinφ2) - backshift.latitude;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` value would be computed differently, potentially leading to a different value for `φ2`.

DONE.
