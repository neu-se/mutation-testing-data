  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder is used to calculate the ceiling of a number, and using 0 as the value would cause the function to always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder is used to calculate the ceiling of a number, and using 100 as the value would cause the function to always return 100, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder is used to calculate the ceiling of a number, and using Math.PI as the value would cause the function to always return a different number than expected, depending on the input.

DONE.
