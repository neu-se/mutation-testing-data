 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation changes the behavior of the function, and if there are no tests checking for the correct output, it would not be caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the test object to a string, rather than invoking the `test` method. If there are no tests checking for the correct method invocation, this would not be caught.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the function with a null value, which would cause a runtime error if the code attempts to invoke it. If there are no tests checking for null values, this would not be caught.

DONE.
