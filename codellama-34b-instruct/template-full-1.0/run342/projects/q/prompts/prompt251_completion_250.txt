  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `hasStacks` causes the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator causes the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator causes the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`.

DONE.
