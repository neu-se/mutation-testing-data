  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b && a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` would be evaluated first, and then `b` would be evaluated. In the original code, `b` is evaluated first, and then `a` is evaluated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` would be evaluated first, and then `b` would be evaluated. In the original code, `b` is evaluated first, and then `a` is evaluated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b && a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` would be evaluated first, and then `a` would be evaluated. In the original code, `a` is evaluated first, and then `b` is evaluated.

DONE.
