  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `rejected`, so if `rejected` is true, the condition will now be false, and if `rejected` is false, the condition will now be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates both operands and returns the second operand if both are true, otherwise it returns the first operand. Since `rejected` is already a boolean value, adding `&& false` will always return `false`, regardless of the value of `rejected`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates both operands and returns the first operand if it
