  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `num`, which would return the number of characters in the string, while `1` would always return 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `num`, which would return the number of characters in the string, while `"1"` would always return the string "1".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `num`, which would return the number of characters in the string, while `null` would always return null.

DONE.
