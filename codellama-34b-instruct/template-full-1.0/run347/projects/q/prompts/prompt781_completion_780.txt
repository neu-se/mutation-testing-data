  Sure, here are three different options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same value as `Q.all`, which is the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the same reason as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a fulfilled promise with the same value as the original promise.

DONE.
