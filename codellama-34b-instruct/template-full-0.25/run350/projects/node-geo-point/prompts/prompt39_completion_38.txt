  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different mathematical operation than `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different mathematical operation than `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is a different mathematical operation than `a`.

DONE.
