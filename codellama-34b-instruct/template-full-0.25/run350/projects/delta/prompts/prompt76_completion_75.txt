  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is now null, which would cause the `if` statement that checks for an empty string to evaluate to false, even if the inserted value is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is now undefined, which would cause the `if` statement that checks for an empty string to evaluate to false, even if the inserted value is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is now an empty string, which would cause the `if` statement that checks for an empty string to evaluate to true, even if the inserted value is not an empty string.

DONE.
