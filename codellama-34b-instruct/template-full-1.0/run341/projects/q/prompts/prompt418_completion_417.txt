  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 <>
```
This would result in different behavior because "<<" and ">>" are not valid operators in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<
```
This would result in different behavior because "!" is a boolean operator and will inverse the value of the condition within the parentheses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~<>
```
This would result in different behavior because "~" is a bitwise operator that inverts the value of the expression within the parentheses.

DONE.
