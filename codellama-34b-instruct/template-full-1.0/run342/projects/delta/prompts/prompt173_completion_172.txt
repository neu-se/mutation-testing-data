  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length variable to decrement instead of increment, leading to the loop never ending or not executing as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
+length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length variable to increment twice instead of once, leading to the loop executing more or less times than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
length++;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length variable to increment twice instead of once, leading to the loop executing more or less times than intended.

DONE.
