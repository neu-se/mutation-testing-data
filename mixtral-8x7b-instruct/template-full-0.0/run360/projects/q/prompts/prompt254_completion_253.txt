 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed as the arguments to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which might cause unexpected results if the method expects a non-empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages
```
This would result in different behavior because the `messages` array would be passed as the arguments to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which would cause the new promise to behave differently as it would be processing the `messages` array instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because a fixed array of numbers would be passed as the arguments to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which would cause the new promise to behave differently as it would be processing this fixed array instead of the actual arguments.

DONE.
