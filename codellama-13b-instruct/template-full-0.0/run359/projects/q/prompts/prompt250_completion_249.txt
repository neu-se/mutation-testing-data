  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer include the newline character, which is used to separate the stack trace from the rest of the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would include a space character in the stack trace, which would make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would include a period character in the stack trace, which would make it more difficult to read and understand.

DONE.
