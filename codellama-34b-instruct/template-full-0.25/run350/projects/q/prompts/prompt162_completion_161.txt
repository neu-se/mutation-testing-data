  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of words, rather than an array of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, but with an extra empty string at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack string into an array of lines, and then filter out any empty strings.

DONE.
