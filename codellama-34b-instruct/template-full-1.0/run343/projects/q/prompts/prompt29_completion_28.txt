  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.shift()` method removes the first element of the `laterQueue` array, whereas the `.length` property returns the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.pop()` method removes the last element of the `laterQueue` array, whereas the `.length` property returns the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.push()` method adds a new element to the end of the `laterQueue` array, whereas the `.length` property returns the length of the array.

DONE.
