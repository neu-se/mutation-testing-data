  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different character (NULL) instead of the Byte Order Mark (BOM) character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the BOM character followed by the NULL character, which is not the same as just matching the BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\u0001/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the BOM character followed by the Start of Heading (SOH) character, which is not the same as just matching the BOM character.

DONE.
