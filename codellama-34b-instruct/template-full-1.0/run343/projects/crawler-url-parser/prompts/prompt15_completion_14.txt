  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:^|\.)\s*#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match inline comments that are not at the end of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#[a-z0-9]$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match comments that start with a letter or number, and ignore other characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\S\r\n]#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match comments that have leading whitespace, and ignore other characters.

DONE.
