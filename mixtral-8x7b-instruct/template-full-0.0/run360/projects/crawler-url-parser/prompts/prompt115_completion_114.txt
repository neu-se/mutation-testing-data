 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the map's values, whereas the original code uses the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of keys instead of an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(urlMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of values using Object.values instead of using the Map object's built-in iterator.

DONE.
