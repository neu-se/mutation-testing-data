   Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to slice the input argument list from the first index to the end, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to slice the input argument list from the first index to the end, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to slice the input argument list from the first index to the end, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
