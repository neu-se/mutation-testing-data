  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of i would be 1, causing the loop to start from the second index instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var j = i
```
This would result in different behavior because j would be assigned the value of i, which would cause the loop to iterate over the same index twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of i would be equal to the length of the array, causing the loop to exit immediately without iterating over any elements.

DONE.
