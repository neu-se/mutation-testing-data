  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with an error argument, which would cause the `find` function to return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of rejecting with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an error argument, which would cause the `find` function to return a promise that rejects with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an error argument, which would cause the `find` function to return a promise that rejects with an error.

DONE.
