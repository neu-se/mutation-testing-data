  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test checks if the imaginary part of the exponent is zero, while the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the base is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test checks if the real part of the exponent is zero, while the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the base is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the test checks if the real and imaginary parts of the exponent are equal, while the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the base is zero.

DONE.
