  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of calling `mapper` on `data`, while this new code fragment returns the result of adding 1 to that result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of calling `mapper` on `data`, while this new code fragment returns the result of multiplying that result by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of calling `mapper` on `data`, while this new code fragment returns the result of subtracting 1 from that result.

DONE.
