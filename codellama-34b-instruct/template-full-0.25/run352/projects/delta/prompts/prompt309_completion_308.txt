  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation onto the line, rather than the current operation, which could result in a different final state of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next two operations onto the line, rather than the current operation, which could result in a different final state of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(3));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next three operations onto the line, rather than the current operation, which could result in a different final state of the line.

DONE.
