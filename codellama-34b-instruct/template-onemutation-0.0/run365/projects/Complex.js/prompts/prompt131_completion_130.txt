  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. In this case, the `isNaN` check would always return `false`, even if the value is infinite, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
