  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pipes the `zipArchive` to the `output` stream, but this new code fragment also adds an error event listener to the `output` stream. If an error occurs while piping the `zipArchive` to the `output` stream, the `reject` function will be called, which will cause the promise to be rejected. In contrast, the original code fragment does not handle errors that occur while piping the `zipArchive` to the `output` stream.

DONE.
