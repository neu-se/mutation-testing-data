  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return a value, while the new fragment `null` would return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return a value, while the new fragment `undefined` would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return a value, while the new fragment `aborted.message` would return the message property of the `aborted` object.

DONE.
