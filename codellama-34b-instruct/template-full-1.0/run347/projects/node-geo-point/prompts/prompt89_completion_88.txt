  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cosδ = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosδ` variable is always set to 0, regardless of the value of `δ`. This would cause the `y` and `x` variables to also be set to 0, resulting in the `λ2` variable being always set to 0, regardless of the value of `θ`. This would cause the `λ2` variable to be always set to 0, regardless of the value of `θ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const sinδ = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinδ` variable is always set to 0, regardless of the value of `δ`. This would cause the `sinφ2` variable to be always set to 0, regardless of the value of `φ1` and `sinθ`. This would cause the `λ2` variable to be always set to 0, regardless of the value of `θ`.

Option 3: The PLACEH
