  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.nextType` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `iter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength` would return the length of the current operation, whereas `iter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.nextLength` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `iter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation.

DONE.
