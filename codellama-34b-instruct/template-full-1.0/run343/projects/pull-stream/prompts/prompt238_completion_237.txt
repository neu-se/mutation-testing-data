  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would pass the incorrect argument to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would pass `null` as the `data` argument to the `cb` function, instead of the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would pass `undefined` as the `data` argument to the `cb` function, instead of the expected data.

DONE.
