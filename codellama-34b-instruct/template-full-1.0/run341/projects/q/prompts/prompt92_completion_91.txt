  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the check for the number of arguments passed to the function, causing the function to behave differently when called with a different number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the number of arguments passed to the function is greater than 1, causing the function to behave differently when called with a different number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the number of arguments passed to the function is less than 1, causing the function to behave differently when called with a different number of arguments.

DONE.
