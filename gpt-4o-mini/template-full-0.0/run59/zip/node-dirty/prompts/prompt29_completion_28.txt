Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the key in the map instead of returning the value associated with the key, which would lead to incorrect results when trying to retrieve stored data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) || 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a default value (a string 'default') when the key does not exist, instead of returning `undefined`, which could mislead users into thinking that a value is present when it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to set a value in the map instead of retrieving it, which would cause the `get` method to modify the state of the `_data` map instead of simply returning a value.

DONE.
