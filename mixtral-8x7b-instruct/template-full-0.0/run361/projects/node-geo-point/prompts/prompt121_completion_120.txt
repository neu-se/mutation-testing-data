 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(Math.sin(θ), Math.cos(θ) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(φ1) + Math.sin(φ1) * Math.sin(φ2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the wrong order of arguments for the `atan2` function, which can lead to incorrect bearing values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(Math.sin(Δλ) * Math.cos(φ2) / (Math.cos(φ1) * Math.sin(φ2) - Math.sin(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2) * Math.cos(Δλ)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `atan` function instead of the `atan2` function, which can lead to incorrect bearing values due to the loss of information about the signs of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
