  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable would be set to `true` immediately, causing the `deferred.resolve` function to be called immediately, which would result in the promise being resolved with the original value, rather than waiting for the `fallback` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable would be set to `false` immediately, causing the `deferred.resolve` function to be called immediately, which would result in the promise being resolved with the original value, rather than waiting for the `fallback` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable would be set to `undefined` immediately, causing the `deferred.resolve` function to be called immediately, which would result in the promise being resolved with the original
