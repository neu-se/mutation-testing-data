  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a promise, and `reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason. In the original code, `deferred.makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is used to pass the `error` to the `onUnhandledError` function, which may handle it in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` is used to notify the promise's deferred that something has happened, but it does not affect the promise's resolution. In the original code, `deferred.makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is used to pass the `error` to the `onUnhandledError` function, which may handle it in a different way.
