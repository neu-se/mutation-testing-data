Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the exception instead of rejecting it, leading to a fulfilled promise state instead of a rejected one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a generic string message instead of the original exception, potentially losing the context of the actual error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the original value instead of handling the rejection, which could lead to incorrect promise state management and unexpected behavior in promise chaining.

DONE.
