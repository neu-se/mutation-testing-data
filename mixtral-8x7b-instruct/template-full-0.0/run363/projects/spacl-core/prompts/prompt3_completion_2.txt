 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a negative character set (`[^/]`) which is replaced with a positive character set, removing the negation. This change would allow paths to contain forward slashes (`/`), which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greedy quantifier (`*`), while the replacement uses a possessive quantifier (`*+`). This change would cause the regular expression to fail to match paths that contain a sequence of characters that can be matched by the quantified pattern followed by a character that should not be matched by the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
