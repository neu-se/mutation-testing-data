  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed an item to the unhandledReasons array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed an item to the unhandledReasons array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed an item to the unhandledReasons array.

DONE.
