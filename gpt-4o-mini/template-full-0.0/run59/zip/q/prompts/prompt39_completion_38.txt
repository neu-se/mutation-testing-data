Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the domain to exit unconditionally, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the task execution flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `exit` method on the domain, which could lead to resource leaks or incorrect domain management during task execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also skip the domain exit call, similar to using `null`, but could introduce confusion as `undefined` is often used to indicate the absence of a value, potentially leading to silent failures in domain management.

DONE.
