  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `array_slice` which creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_splice` removes and replaces the specified elements from an array, returning the deleted elements. This would lead to the `become` function being called with a different `newPromise` argument, which might result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_push(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `array_slice` which creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_push` adds one or more elements to the end of an array. This would lead to the `become` function being called with a different `newPromise` argument, which might result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_shift
