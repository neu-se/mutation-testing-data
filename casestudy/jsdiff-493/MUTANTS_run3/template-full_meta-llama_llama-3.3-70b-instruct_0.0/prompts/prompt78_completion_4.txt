Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` check would only consider the object's own properties, ignoring the key, which could lead to incorrect results if the object has inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` check would only consider the key, not the object, which would always return false and prevent any properties from being added to the `sortedKeys` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
canonicalizedObj
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` check would be performed on the `canonicalizedObj` instead of the original object, which could lead to incorrect results if the canonicalization process modifies the object's properties or structure.

DONE.
