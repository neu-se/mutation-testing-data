  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js-"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "js:" substring is now missing, which would break the regex pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(MODULE.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the case of the words "MODULE" and "js" have been changed, which would break the regex pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "-" character has been added, which would break the regex pattern.

DONE.
