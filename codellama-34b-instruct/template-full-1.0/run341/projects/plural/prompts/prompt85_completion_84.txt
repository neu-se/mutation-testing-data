  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "mouses" has a different plural form than "mice". The plural form "mice" would be returned for both "mouse" and "mouses" which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'eles', 'elves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "eles" has a different singular form than "elves". The singular form "elves" would be returned for both "ele" and "eles" which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'houses', 'čouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "čouses" has a different plural form than "houses". The plural form "houses" would be returned for both "house" and "čouses" which is incorrect.

DONE.
