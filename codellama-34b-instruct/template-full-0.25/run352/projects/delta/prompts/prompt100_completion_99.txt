  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the condition, so the `if` statement would be executed even if `lastOp.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is checking for strict equality, so the `if` statement would be executed only if `lastOp.attributes` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is checking for strict equality, so the `if` statement would be executed only if `lastOp.attributes` is `null`.
