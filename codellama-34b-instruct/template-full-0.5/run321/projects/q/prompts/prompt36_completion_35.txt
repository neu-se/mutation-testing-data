  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `isNodeJS`, so the code inside the `if` statement would be executed even if `isNodeJS` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, so the code inside the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof isNodeJS === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if `isNodeJS` is defined, and if it is not defined, the code inside the `if` statement would be executed.

DONE.
