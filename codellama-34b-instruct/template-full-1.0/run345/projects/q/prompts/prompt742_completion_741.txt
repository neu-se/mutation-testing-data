  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(promise.then(), onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then()` returns a promise, but the original code uses `.when()` which takes a function that returns a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(promise.inspect()?, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.inspect()` returns a promise with a different set of states than `.when()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(promise.spread(), onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.spread()` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of resolved values.

DONE.
