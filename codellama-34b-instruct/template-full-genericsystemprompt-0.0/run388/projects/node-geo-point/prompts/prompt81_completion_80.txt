  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value instead of the longitude value, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude value, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude value, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
