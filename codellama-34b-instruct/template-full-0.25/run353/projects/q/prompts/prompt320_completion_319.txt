  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op]` is a function that takes two arguments, but `descriptor[op].apply` is a method that takes three arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op].call` is a method that takes two arguments, but `descriptor[op].apply` is a method that takes three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `descriptor[op].bind` is a method that returns a new function with a bound context and arguments, but `descriptor[op].apply` is a method that takes three arguments.

DONE.
