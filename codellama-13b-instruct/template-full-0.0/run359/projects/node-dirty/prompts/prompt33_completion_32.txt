  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not set the value for the given key, and the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value for the given key to `0`, and the `get` method would return `0` instead of the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value for the given key to an empty string, and the `get` method would return an empty string instead of the actual value.

DONE.
