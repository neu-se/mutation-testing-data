  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to terminate earlier or later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to increment `i` by a factor of 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to terminate earlier or later than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to terminate earlier or later than expected.

DONE.
