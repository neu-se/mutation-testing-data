  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `next` advances the iterator and returns the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `next` advances the iterator and returns the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[0]` returns the first operation in the delta, whereas `thisIter.next` returns the next operation in the delta.

DONE.
