  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with a fixed value of `1`, which would cause the function to always return the same value regardless of the arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with an empty array, which would cause the function to always return an empty array regardless of the arguments passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is replaced with a `null` value, which would cause the function to always return `null` regardless of the arguments passed to it.

DONE.
