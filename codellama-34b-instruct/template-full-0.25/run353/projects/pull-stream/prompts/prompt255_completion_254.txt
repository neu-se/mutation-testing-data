  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` is a function call, whereas `nextStream` is a reference to the function itself. In the original code, `nextStream` is called later in the code, but with this change, it would be called immediately, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to `nextStream`. In the original code, `nextStream` is called with no arguments, but with this change, it is called with `null` and a function that takes `err` and `data`
