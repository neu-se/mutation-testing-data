  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the array `nodeArgs` to be emptied, which would likely cause an error in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the first element of the array `nodeArgs` with the value `0`, which would likely cause an error in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array `nodeArgs`, which would likely cause an error in the code that uses it.

DONE.
