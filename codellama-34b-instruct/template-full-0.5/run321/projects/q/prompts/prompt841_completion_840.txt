  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called immediately with a `null` value, rather than being passed as the second argument to `then` and called only if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` value would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called immediately with a `void 0` value, rather than being passed as the second argument to `then` and called only if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to
