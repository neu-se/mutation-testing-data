  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the calculated value of φ2 instead of φ1, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of λ2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of φ1 and φ2, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of λ2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of φ1 and φ2, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of λ2.

DONE.
