  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(err)` to reject the promise with the error object `err`, while this modified code fragment uses `deferred.reject(rejection)` to reject the promise with the rejection object `rejection`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.resolve(promises)` to resolve the promise with the array of promises `promises`, while this modified code fragment uses `deferred.reject(rejection)` to reject the promise with the rejection object `rejection`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify(promises)` to notify the promise with the array of promises `promises
