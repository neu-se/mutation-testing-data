  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, causing the `for` loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by 1, causing the `for` loop to start at the second element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be multiplied by 2, causing the `for` loop to iterate over every other element in the array.

DONE.
