  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed `promise` to `unhandledRejections`, while this alternative pushes `reason`. This change could potentially cause a scenario where `promise` is pushed more times than intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed `reason` to `unhandledReasons`, while this alternative pushes `promise`. This change could potentially cause a scenario where `reason` is pushed more times than intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed `promise` and `reason` to `unhandledRejections` in separate steps, while this alternative pushes both values in
