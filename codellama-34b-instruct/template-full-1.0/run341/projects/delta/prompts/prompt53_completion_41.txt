  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(`no handlers for embed type "${embedType}"`) // This will always throw an error, regardless of whether a handler is defined or not, because the condition is always true.
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only throws an error if no handler is defined, while the modified code always throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof handler !== 'function') // This will only throw an error if the handler is not a function, rather than always throwing an error if the handler is not defined.
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the handler is defined, while the modified code also checks if the handler is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!handler || typeof handler !== 'function') // This will only throw an error if the handler is not defined or not a function, which is more explicit and specific than the original code.
```
This would result in different behavior because the
