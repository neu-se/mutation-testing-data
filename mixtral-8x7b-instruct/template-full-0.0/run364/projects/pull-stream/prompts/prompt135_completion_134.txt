 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the process would be terminated immediately, rather than invoking the callback function `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be printed to the console instead of invoking the callback function `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would enter an infinite loop, and the callback function `cb` would never be invoked.

DONE.
