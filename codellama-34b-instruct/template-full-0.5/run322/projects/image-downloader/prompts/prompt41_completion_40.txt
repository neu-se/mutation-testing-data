  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise. If `resolve` is used instead of `reject`, the promise will be resolved with the `TimeoutError` object, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Timeout')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise. If `throw` is used instead of `reject`, the promise will be rejected with a new `Error` object, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that represents the absence of a value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise. If `null` is used instead of `re
