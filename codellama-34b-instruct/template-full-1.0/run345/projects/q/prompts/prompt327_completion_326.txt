  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fallback` function to be called with a `null` value, which could lead to a different outcome than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fallback` function to be called with an `undefined` value, which could lead to a different outcome than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fallback` function to be called with a `true` value, which could lead to a different outcome than the original code.

DONE.
