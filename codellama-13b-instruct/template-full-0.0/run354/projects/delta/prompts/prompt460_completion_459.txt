  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return the next operation in the list, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return the previous operation in the list, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would return the last operation in the list, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
