  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "put", [key, value]
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a method of an object that is not a promise, whereas "post" is a method of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "get", [key]
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a method of a promise that returns a value associated with a key, whereas "post" is a method of a promise that updates the value associated with a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "delete", [key]
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a method of a promise that removes a key-value pair, whereas "post" is a method of a promise that updates the value associated with a key.

DONE.
