  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in an object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in an object. In the code fragment, `Object.keys(data.timezones)` is used to extract the timezones from the `data` object, so replacing it with `Object.values(data.timezones)` would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of [key, value] pairs for an object, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` return arrays of keys and values separately. In the code fragment, `Object.keys(data.timezones)` and `Object.values(data.timezones)` are used to extract the timezones and their corresponding IDs from the `data` object, so replacing them with `Object.entries(data.timezones)` would
