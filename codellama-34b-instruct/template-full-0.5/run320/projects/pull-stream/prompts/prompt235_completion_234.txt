  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return sync ? loop = true : loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would always terminate after one iteration, causing the function to return early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return early if `sync` is true, but continue to the next iteration if `sync` is false.

DONE.
