  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, while the new code fragment captures the last group of non-slash characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the trailing slash, while the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+?)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greedy quantifier, while the new code fragment uses a lazy quantifier.

DONE.
