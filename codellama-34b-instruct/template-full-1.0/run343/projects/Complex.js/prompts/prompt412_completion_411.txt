  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `===` operator to check for equality, while the new code fragment uses the `>` operator to check for greater than.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `===` operator to check for equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!=` operator to check for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tested for equality with `0`, while the new code fragment tests for equality with `1`.

DONE.
