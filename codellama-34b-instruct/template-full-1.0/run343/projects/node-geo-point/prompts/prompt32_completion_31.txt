  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + deg2rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would be added to `1`, causing a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used as the argument to `deg2rad`, causing a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the argument to `deg2rad`, causing a type error.

DONE.
