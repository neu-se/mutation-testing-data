  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing a subset of the elements from the original array, starting from the specified index. In this case, it would skip the first element in the array, which could cause the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, it would remove any `undefined` elements from the array, which could cause the callbacks to be called in a
