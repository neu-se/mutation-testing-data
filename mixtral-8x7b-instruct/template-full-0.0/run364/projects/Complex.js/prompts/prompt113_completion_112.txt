 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor !== Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor of `this` is equal to `Complex`, rather than checking if `this` is an instance of `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor !== Function.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor of `this` is not equal to the default constructor of `Function`, which is not equivalent to checking if `this` is an instance of `Complex`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.prototype === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` has a `prototype` property that is equal to `undefined`, which is not a valid check for an instance of `Complex`.

DONE.
