  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of the matched pattern, while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.*/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches a single character, while this new code fragment matches zero or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.+/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches a single character, while this new code fragment matches one or more characters.

DONE.
