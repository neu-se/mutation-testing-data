 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `plural` expects a string as the first argument, but it would receive a number instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `plural` would check if the second argument is not equal to 1, but it would always be false since 'foo' is a string and cannot be equal to a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the regular expression or string used to match the word, not the word itself.

DONE.
