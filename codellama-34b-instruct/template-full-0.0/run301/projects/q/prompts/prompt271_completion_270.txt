  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to the boolean value `true`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is not equal to the boolean value `false`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is not equal to the value `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
