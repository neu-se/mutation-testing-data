  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the argument to `Math.sqrt` to be negative, which would result in a complex number being returned instead of a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the square of the argument to `Math.sqrt` would be a positive number, which would result in a real number being returned instead of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to `Math.sqrt` would be increased by 1, which would result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
