  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `any` method a property of the `Promise.prototype` object, which could cause issues with inheritance and unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
promise.then(() => Promise.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise that resolves to the `Promise.prototype` object, which could cause issues with error handling and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
function() { return Promise.prototype; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that returns the `Promise.prototype` object, which could cause issues with expected return values and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
