  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` property would be set to null for all tasks, regardless of their original domain values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` property would be set to undefined for all tasks, regardless of their original task values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, {domain: "myDomain"}
```
This would result in different behavior because all tasks would be assigned to the `myDomain` domain, regardless of their original domains values.

DONE.
