  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the end of the `src` variable, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `src` variable, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `src` variable to uppercase, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

DONE.
