 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always be called with `abort` set to `false`, even if `abort` was set to `true` before. This could cause the function to continue processing data even when it was supposed to abort.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always be called with `abort` set to `null`, which is a falsy value. This could cause the function to continue processing data even when it was supposed to abort.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always be called with `abort` set to `1`, which is a truthy value. This could cause the function to abort processing data even when it was not supposed to.

DONE.
