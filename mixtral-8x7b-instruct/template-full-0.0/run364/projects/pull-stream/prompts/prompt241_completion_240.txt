 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function might not accept `null` as an argument, causing potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the data type of the returned value, which might cause issues if the consuming code expects a specific data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an infinite loop, as the `read` function is called again inside the callback, causing the `while` loop to never terminate.

DONE.
