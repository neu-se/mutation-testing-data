  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/z/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would no longer match any words in the English language, resulting in incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(b|f|p|v)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would no longer match words that end in "y" or "x" but do match words that end in "b", "f", "p", or "v".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would no longer match words that end in "o", "i", "u", "y" but does match words that end in any of the letters in the character class.

DONE.
