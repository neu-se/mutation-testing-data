  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof exports` check would fail, causing the `typeof module` check to be evaluated, which would return `true` if `module` is an object, but not if it's a function or any other type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof exports` check would pass, causing the `typeof module` check to be evaluated, which would return `false` if `module` is not an object, but not if it's a function or any other type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" || typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof exports` check would fail, causing the `typeof module` check to be evaluated, which would return `true` if
