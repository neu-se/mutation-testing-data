  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it would change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `b`, which would change the result of the `cosh` function.

DONE.
