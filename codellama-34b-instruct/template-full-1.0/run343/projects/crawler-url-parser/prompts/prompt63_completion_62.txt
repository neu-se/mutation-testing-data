  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.domain` is a different value than `ret.host`, and it would lead to a different outcome in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.search` is a different value than `ret.host`, and it would lead to a different outcome in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.path` is a different value than `ret.host`, and it would lead to a different outcome in the `parse` function.

DONE.
