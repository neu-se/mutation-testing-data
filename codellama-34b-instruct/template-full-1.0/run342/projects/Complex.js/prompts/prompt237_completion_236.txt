  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `b` being non-zero, but replacing it with 0 would cause the conditional to always be false, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `a` being non-zero, but replacing it with 1 would cause the conditional to always be true, resulting in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a+b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `a` being non-zero, but replacing it with `a+b` would cause the conditional to depend on both `a` and `b`, which would change the outcome.

DONE.
