Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `null` instead of `undefined`, which means that if `fallback` is explicitly set to `null`, the code would not assign a new fallback function, potentially leading to unhandled operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `fallback` is not `undefined`, which would allow the code to execute the fallback function even if it is set to a falsy value like `0` or `false`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fallback === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator to check for `undefined`, which is a different approach than directly comparing to `void 0`. This could lead to inconsistencies if `fallback` is reassigned in a way that changes its type.

DONE.
