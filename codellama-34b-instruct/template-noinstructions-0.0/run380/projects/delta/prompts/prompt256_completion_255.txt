  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality instead of deep equality, which could cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert == otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for loose equality instead of deep equality, which could cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.equals(otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `equals` method on the `insert` property, which could have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
