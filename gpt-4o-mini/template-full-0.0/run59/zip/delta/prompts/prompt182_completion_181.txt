Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the length used for the operation, potentially causing the `next` method to retrieve more elements than intended, leading to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the length of the `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations that require a specific length, resulting in unexpected behavior in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation instead of the other operation, which could lead to mismatched operations being composed together, potentially altering the intended outcome of the `compose` method.

DONE.
