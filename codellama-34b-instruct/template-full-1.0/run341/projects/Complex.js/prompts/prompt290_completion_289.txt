  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would calculate the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment would calculate the negative cosine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would calculate the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment would calculate the reciprocal of `b` and then the cosine of that result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would calculate the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment would calculate the cosine of `b` squared.

DONE.
