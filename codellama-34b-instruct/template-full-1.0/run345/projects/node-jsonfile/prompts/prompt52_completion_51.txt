  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toISOString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object in ISO format, which is not the same as the original behavior that returns the object as a string using JSON.stringify().

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toLocaleString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object in the current locale, which is not the same as the original behavior that returns the object as a string using JSON.stringify().

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object using the toString() method of the object, which is not the same as the original behavior that returns the object as a string using JSON.stringify().

DONE.
