  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the domain of the hostname, rather than the domain of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the subdomain of the hostname, rather than the subdomain of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host).domain.split('.').reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last part of the domain name, rather than the full domain name.

DONE.
