  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the promise being resolved or rejected, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the error instead of being resolved or rejected, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error.

DONE.
