 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Function && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `instanceof` operator instead of `typeof`, and checks if `a` is an instance of the `Function` constructor instead of checking if `a` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first argument is equal to the number 1, instead of checking if `a` is a function with a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length !== 1
