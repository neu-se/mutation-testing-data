  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always remove one character from the end of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in a consonant or a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always add one character to the end of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in a consonant or a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always double the length of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in a consonant or a vowel.

DONE.
