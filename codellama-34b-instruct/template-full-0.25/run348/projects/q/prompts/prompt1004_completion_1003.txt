  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called on the object would change from `post` to `get`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument would be passed to the method, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the method would be different, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
