  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the latitude and longitude values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a constant value, regardless of the latitude and longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude * Math.PI) / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiple the longitude value by a constant value, potentially changing the calculated distance.

DONE.
