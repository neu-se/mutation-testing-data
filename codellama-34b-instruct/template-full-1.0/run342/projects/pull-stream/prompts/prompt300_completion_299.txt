  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of `ended`, instead of returning `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of `ended`, instead of returning `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `ended` as `false`, instead of returning `ended`.

DONE.
