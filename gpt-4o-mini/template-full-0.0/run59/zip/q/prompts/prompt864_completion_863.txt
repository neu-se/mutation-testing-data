Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the provided `object`, rather than returning a promise that resolves after the specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a promise that is immediately rejected with the provided `object`, instead of delaying the resolution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves immediately with the value of `object`, rather than waiting for the specified timeout before resolving.

DONE.
