  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new operation at the end of the delta, whereas `push` appends the operation to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is a property of the `other` delta object, and `push` would append the operation to the end of the `other` delta's operations, rather than to the end of the current delta's operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Delta` constructor expects an array of operations to be passed in, and `null` would result in an empty delta being created, which would not be correct.

DONE.
