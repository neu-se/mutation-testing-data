  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the reason as the message, whereas the original code would simply reject with the reason as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason + "!")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject with a string that is the reason concatenated with an exclamation mark, whereas the original code would simply reject with the reason as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject with the reason in uppercase, whereas the original code would simply reject with the reason as is.

DONE.
