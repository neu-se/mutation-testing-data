  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the `y` variable instead of the `x` variable, which could lead to unexpected results if the `y` variable has a different value than the `x` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the `x` variable, which could lead to unexpected results if the `x` variable is not a number or if the addition operation is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the `x` variable by 2, which could lead to unexpected results if the `x` variable is not a number or if the multiplication operation is not intended.

DONE.
