  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `err === true`, which means that the `nextStream` function will not be called if `err` is `false`. However, if we replace the code fragment with `if (err === false)`, the `nextStream` function will be called even if `err` is `false`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `err === true`, which means that the `nextStream` function will not be called if `err` is `null`. However, if we replace the code fragment with `if (err === null)`, the `nextStream` function will be called even if `err` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err !== true)
```
This would result in
