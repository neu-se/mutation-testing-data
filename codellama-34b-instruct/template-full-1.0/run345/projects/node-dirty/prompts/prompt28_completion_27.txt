  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'flush' is a different event emitted by the `Dirty` class, and it may not be handled by the code that listens to the 'drain' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because ' ' is not a valid event name, and it may cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'close' is a different event emitted by the `Dirty` class, and it may not be handled by the code that listens to the 'drain' event.

DONE.
