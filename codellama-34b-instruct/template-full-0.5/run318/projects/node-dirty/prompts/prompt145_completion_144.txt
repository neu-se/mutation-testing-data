  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the current object, whereas `this.emit` simply calls the `emit` method on the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.call(null)` calls the `emit` method on the `null` object, whereas `this.emit` calls the `emit` method on the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit.apply(null)` calls the `emit` method on the `null` object, whereas `this.emit` calls the `emit` method on the current object.

DONE.
