  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. Replacing it with `-b` would negate the imaginary part, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. Replacing it with `b + 1` would add 1 to the imaginary part, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. Replacing it with `b * 2` would double the imaginary part, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
