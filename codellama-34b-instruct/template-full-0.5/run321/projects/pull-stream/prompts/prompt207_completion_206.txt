  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply returns the `aborted` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument only if `abortCb` is truthy. The original code calls `abortCb` regardless of its truthiness.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb || abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument only if `abortCb` is falsy. The original code calls `abortCb` regardless of
