  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh(b)` is a different function than `sinh(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is a different function than `sinh(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(b)` is a different function than `sinh(b)`.

DONE.
