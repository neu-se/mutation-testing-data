  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could potentially break the code that relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.map(func)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are now being transformed by the `map` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the code that relies on the original arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.filter(func)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are now being filtered by the `filter` function, which could potentially remove some arguments that were previously passed to the function.

DONE.
