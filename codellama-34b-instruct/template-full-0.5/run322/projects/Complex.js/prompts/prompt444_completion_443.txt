  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1`, even if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `1` instead of `0`, leading to a different result in the `round` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `-1`, even if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `-1` instead of `0`, leading to a different result in the `round` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `Math.PI`, even if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `Math.PI
