Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value returned from the generator by adding 1 to it, which changes the expected output of the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done ? Q(result.value) : when(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `result.value` instead of `result`, potentially leading to an error if `result` is not a promise, thus altering the flow of promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(result.done, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `result.done` (a boolean) as the first argument to `when`, which expects a promise, leading to unexpected behavior in promise handling.

DONE.
