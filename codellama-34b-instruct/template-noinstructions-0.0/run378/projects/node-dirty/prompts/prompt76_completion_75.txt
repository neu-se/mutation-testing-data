  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the database is empty, while the new code fragment returns 1, indicating that the database contains one key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the database is empty, while the new code fragment returns -1, indicating that the database contains one key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the database is empty, while the new code fragment returns null, indicating that the database contains no keys.

DONE.
