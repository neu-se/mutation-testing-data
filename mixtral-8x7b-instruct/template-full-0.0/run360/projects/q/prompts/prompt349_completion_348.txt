 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("New error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error message is created instead of using the original exception object. This change would affect any error handling or logging that relies on the original error object's stack trace or other properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is returned instead of a rejection. This change would cause any error handling code to not execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Rejection message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new rejection is created instead of propagating the original exception. This change would affect any error handling or logging that relies on the original error object's stack trace or other properties.

DONE.
