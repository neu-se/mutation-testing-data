  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(min < 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
