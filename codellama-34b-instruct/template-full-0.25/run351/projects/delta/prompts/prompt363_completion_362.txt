  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext()` is a method call that returns the result of the method, which is a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext === true` is a boolean expression that checks whether the result of the method call is equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext !== false` is a boolean expression that checks whether the result of the
