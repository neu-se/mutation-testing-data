  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would be replaced with the number `1`, which would cause the code to fail because it would no longer be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would be replaced with the result of adding `1` to the `Q` function, which would cause the code to fail because it would no longer be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would be called with the argument `1`, which would cause the code to fail because it would no longer be a function.

DONE.
