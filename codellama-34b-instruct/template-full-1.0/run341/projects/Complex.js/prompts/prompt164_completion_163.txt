  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && (a !== 0 || b !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this` is infinite, while this version also checks if `z` is infinite and if `a` and `b` are not both 0, which is a more comprehensive check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || (z['isZero']() && a !== 0 && b !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this` is infinite, while this version also checks if `z` is zero and if `a` and `b` are not both 0, which is a more comprehensive check.
