  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to be called with a function as the first argument, which would likely result in the function being called and the promise being resolved or rejected based on the function's return value, rather than the expected behavior of resolving or rejecting the promise.

DONE.
