  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is in the progress state instead of the fulfilled state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, and the mutation test would not be able to find any weaknesses in the test suite.

DONE.
