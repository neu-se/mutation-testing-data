  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` would be incorrect, and the correct operation is `b * Math.sin(a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a / Math.sin(b)` would be incorrect, and the correct operation is `b * Math.sin(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * Math.cos(b)` would be incorrect, and the correct operation is `b * Math.sin(a)`.

DONE.
