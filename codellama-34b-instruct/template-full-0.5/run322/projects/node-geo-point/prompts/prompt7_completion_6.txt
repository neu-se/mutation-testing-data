  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with 2 elements, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is actually an array or if it has the correct number of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'`, if the `coordinates` property is an array, and if the `coordinates` property has 2 elements. However, it would still not check if the `coordinates` property is actually an array or if it has the correct number of elements.
