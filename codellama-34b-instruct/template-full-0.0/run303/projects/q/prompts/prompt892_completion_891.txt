  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a different function than `Q`, and it may have different behavior or side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different function than `Q`, and it may have different behavior or side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(callback, this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a different function than `Q`, and it may have different behavior or side effects.

DONE.
