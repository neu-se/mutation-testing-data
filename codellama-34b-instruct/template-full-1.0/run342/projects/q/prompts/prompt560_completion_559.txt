  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be always truthy, causing the `if` statement to always be executed, regardless of whether the iterator has reached its end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always be truthy, causing the `if` statement to always be executed, regardless of whether the iterator has reached its end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always be falsy, causing the `if` statement to never be executed, even when the iterator has reached its end.

DONE.
