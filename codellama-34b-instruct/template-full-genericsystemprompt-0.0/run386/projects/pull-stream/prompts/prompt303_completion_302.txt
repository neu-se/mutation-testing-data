  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `ended`, causing the `read` function to be called with `end` set to `true` even if `ended` is already `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `read` function to be called with `end` set to `true` only if `ended` is already `true` and `end` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `read` function to be called with `end` set to `true` if either `ended` is already `true` or `end` is `false`.

DONE.
