  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be settled.

DONE.
