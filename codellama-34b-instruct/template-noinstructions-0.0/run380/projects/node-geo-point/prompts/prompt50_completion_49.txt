  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse of `deg2rad`, so it would convert radians to degrees instead of degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and it would be used as a substitute for the `deg2rad` function, which is used to convert degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, and it would be used as a substitute for the `deg2rad` function, which is used to convert degrees to radians.

DONE.
