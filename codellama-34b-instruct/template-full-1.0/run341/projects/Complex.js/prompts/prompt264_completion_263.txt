  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `a` is a variable representing the real part of a complex number. Using `Math.cos` instead of `a` would result in the computation of the complex cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, while `b` is a variable representing the imaginary part of a complex number. Using `Math.sin` instead of `b` would result in the computation of the complex sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex(a, b)` creates a new complex number with real part `a` and imaginary part `b`, while `a` and `b` are already components
