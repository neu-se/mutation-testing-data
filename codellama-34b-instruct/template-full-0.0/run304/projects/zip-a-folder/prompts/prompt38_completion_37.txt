  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called even if the `src` parameter is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called twice, which could cause performance issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').some(isGlob)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `some()` method checks if any element in the array returned by `src.split(',')` matches the `isGlob` function, which could cause the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called even if the `src` parameter is not a glob.

DONE.
