  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && !z['isZero']()) || (!this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return NaN instead of Infinity in certain cases, such as when the base is Infinity and the exponent is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

(this['isZero']() && !z['isInfinite']()) || (!this['isZero']() && z['isZero']())
