  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with the `promise` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `promise` object as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.reject` function would be called with the `promise` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `promise` object as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would be called with the `promise` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `promise` object as the reason.

DONE.
