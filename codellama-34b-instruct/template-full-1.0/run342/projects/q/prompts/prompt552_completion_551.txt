  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is expected to be called with a generator function, not a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(result.value, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is expected to be called with an object and operation name, not a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(result.value, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects to be called with a promise, not a value.

DONE.
