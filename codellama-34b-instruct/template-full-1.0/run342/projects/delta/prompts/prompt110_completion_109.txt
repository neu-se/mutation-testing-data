  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is never defined, so this expression always returns `false`. In the original code, `newOp.insert` is only defined when the `insert` property is an object with a `name` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` is never defined, so this expression always returns `false`. In the original code, `newOp.retain` is only defined when the `retain` property is an object with a `name` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.retain` is never defined, so this expression always returns `false`. In the original code, `lastOp.retain` is only
