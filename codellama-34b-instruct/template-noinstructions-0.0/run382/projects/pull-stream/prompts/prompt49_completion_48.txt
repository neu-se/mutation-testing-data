  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the first argument to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, which could cause an error if the function is not designed to handle that extra iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, which could cause the arguments to be processed in a different order than expected.

DONE.
