  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, it would become `false`, and if `abort` is `false`, it would become `true`. This would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could result in a different behavior or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `abort` is not a boolean value, it would return `false`, even if the value of `abort` is truthy. This could cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could result in a different behavior or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort != true
```
This would result in different behavior
