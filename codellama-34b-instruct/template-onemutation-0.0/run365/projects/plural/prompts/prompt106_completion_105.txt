  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman" with an optional "wo" prefix, while the buggy code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman" with an optional "wo" prefix and replaces the first "a" with "e".

DONE.
