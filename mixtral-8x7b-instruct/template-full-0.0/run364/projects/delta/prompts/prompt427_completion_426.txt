 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact value `undefined` instead of the type `'number'`. This would make the function return `undefined` when the `retain` property is not present, instead of checking for other types like `number`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the negation of the original condition. This would make the function skip the `retain` check entirely when the `retain` property is a number, and instead proceed to the next condition, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.retain && typeof op.retain === 'number'
