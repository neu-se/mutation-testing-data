  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character is different.

DONE.
