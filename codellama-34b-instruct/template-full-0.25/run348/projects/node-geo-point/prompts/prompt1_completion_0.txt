  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this code checks if they are null. If the `latitude` or `longitude` is null, the constructor will throw an error, even if they are valid numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === 0 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this code checks if they are zero. If the `latitude` or `longitude` is zero, the constructor will throw an error, even if they are valid numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < 0 || longitude < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers, while this
