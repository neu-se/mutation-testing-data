  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `id` to the `current` array instead of the `all` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `a` variable to the `all` array instead of the `id` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `tz.r` property to the `all` array instead of the `id` variable.

DONE.
