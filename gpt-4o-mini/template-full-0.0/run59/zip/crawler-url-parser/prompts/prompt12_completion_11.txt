Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol from HTTP to HTTPS, potentially causing issues if the original URL is not intended to be accessed securely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set the protocol to FTP, which is not suitable for web URLs and could lead to failures in URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the URL to a specific domain, ignoring the original URL structure and potentially leading to incorrect parsing and resolution of the intended URL.

DONE.
