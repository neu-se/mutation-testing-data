Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[country.id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the country in the `countries` object to `null`, which means that subsequent calls to `getCountry` for the same `id` will return `null` instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry({ id: 'unknown' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it memoizes a country with an `id` of `'unknown'`, which does not exist in the data, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to retrieve the actual country data later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[country.id] = { ...country, deprecated: true };
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the country object being memoized by adding a `deprecated` property set to `true`, which could affect how the country is delivered later, especially if the test suite checks for deprecated countries.

DONE.
