  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promises` array would not be spread into the values of its elements, leading to a different outcome in the code that uses the resulting promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promises` array would be rejected, leading to a different outcome in the code that uses the resulting promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(array_map(promises, Q));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promises` array would be resolved with a different set of values, leading to a different outcome in the code that uses the resulting promise.

DONE.
