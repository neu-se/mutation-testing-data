  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the modified code fragment is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `makeNodeResolver()` method, while the modified code fragment passes `null` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `makeNodeResolver()` method, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined` as an argument.

DONE.
