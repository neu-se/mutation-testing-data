  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Number.isFinite` to check if `a['arg']` is finite, but this replacement code uses the greater-than operator to check if `a['arg']` is greater than 0. This could cause the code to behave differently if `a['arg']` is a non-finite value, such as `NaN` or `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Number.isFinite` to check if `a['arg']` is finite, but this replacement code uses the not-equal operator to check if `a['arg']` is not equal to 0. This could cause the code to behave differently if `a['arg']` is a non-finite value, such as `NaN` or `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
