  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * ref.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using a random element of the `ref` array instead of the first one.

DONE.
