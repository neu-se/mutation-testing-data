  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the word itself, while the new code fragment is checking the length of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the first character of the word, while the new code fragment is checking the last character of the word.

DONE.
