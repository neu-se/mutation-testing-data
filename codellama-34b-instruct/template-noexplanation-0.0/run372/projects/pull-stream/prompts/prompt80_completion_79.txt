  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This code fragment is a simple replacement for the original `!cbed` code fragment. It has the same behavior as the original code, but it is a different code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed || abort
```
This code fragment is a more complex replacement for the original `!cbed` code fragment. It adds an additional condition to the `if` statement, which checks if the `abort` variable is truthy. If `abort` is truthy, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true`, even if `cbed` is falsy. This can cause the code to behave differently than the original code, depending on the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed && !abort
```
This code fragment is similar to the original `!cbed` code fragment, but it uses the `&&` operator instead of the `!` operator. This can cause the
