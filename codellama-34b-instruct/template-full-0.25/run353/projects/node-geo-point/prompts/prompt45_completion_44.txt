  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 1 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, while this replacement uses the less-than operator. This would cause the function to return a value of 1 if the distance is less than 1 meter, rather than the original behavior of returning the original distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the multiplication operator, while this replacement uses the power operator. This would cause the function to return a value that is twice the original distance, rather than the original behavior of returning the original distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the addition operator, while this replacement uses the subtraction operator. This would cause the function to return a value that is one meter less than the original distance, rather than the original behavior of returning the
