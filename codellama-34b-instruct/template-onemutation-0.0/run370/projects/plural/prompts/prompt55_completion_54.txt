  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string as arguments, while the new code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a function as arguments. The function in the new code fragment would not be called, and the string "ves" would not be replaced in the original code fragment.
