  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a country object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, even if it was not intended to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return an array of timezone objects, even if it was not intended to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects, even if it was not intended to be returned.

DONE.
