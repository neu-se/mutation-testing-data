  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
