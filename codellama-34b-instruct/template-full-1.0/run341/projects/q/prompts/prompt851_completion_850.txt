  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because deferred.resolve will resolve the promise with the value passed as an argument, whereas deferred.reject will reject the promise with the value passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a proper argument for the reject method and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a proper argument for the reject method and will cause an error.

DONE.
