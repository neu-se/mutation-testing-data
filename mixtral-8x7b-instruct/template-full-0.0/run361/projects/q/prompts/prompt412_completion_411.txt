 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the state is "rejected" instead of "fulfilled", which would cause the wrong branch of the condition to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the value is not undefined instead of checking the state, which would cause the code to consider a promise that is still pending as fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.hasOwnProperty("value")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check if the value property exists in the inspected object instead of checking the state, which would cause the code to consider a promise that is still pending as fulfilled.

DONE.
