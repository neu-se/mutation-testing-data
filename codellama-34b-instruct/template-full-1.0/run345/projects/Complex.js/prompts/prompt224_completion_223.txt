  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for greater than or equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks for strictly greater than zero. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for greater than or equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks for non-zero. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for greater than or equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks for the absolute value of `a` to be greater than zero. This could potentially cause the function to return a different value for some inputs.

DONE.
