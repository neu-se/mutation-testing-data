  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return iter.next() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the element type (ex. `'retain'`, `'insert'`, `'delete'`) and not the actual operation object, which would cause the code to fail when attempting to access the `retain` property of the element type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the element type (ex. `'retain'`, `'insert'`, `'delete'`) and not the actual operation object, which would cause the code to fail when attempting to access the `retain` property of the element type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` would return the element type (ex. `'retain'`, `'insert'`, `'delete'`) and `
