  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id
```
This would result in different behavior because `id` is a function that returns the argument it receives, whereas `abort` is a function that returns a new error with a message derived from the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number, which is not a valid value to pass as an argument to the `abort` function, whereas the original code fragment passes a function reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas the original code fragment passes a function reference.

DONE.
