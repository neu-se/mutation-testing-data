  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(), void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` would be evaluated before the `flush()` function is called, which would cause `requestTick` to be assigned the value `undefined` instead of the function reference `flush`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called immediately after it is returned by the `requestTick` function, without being assigned to the `requestTick` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, function () { return requestTick; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called immediately after it is returned by the `requestTick` function, without being assigned to the `requestTick` variable. Instead, it would return the `requestTick` function reference.

DONE.
