  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always reject the promise, while `thenResolve` will always resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then` would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function(value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then` would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
