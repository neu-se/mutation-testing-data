  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will increment the `inspect` property of the `Promise` object, which may not be intended in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it will delete the `inspect` property of the `Promise` object, which may not be intended in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect = function () { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it will replace the `inspect` property of the `Promise` object with a new function that always returns `false`, which may not be the intended behavior in the original code.

DONE.
