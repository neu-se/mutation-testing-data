  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0, promises.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last promise from the array, which could cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is not fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a rejected promise to the end of the array, which could cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function (promise) { return Q.reject(promise); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map each promise to a rejected promise, which could cause the `allResolved` method to return a promise that is rejected.

DONE.
