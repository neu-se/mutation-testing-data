  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed. Additionally, passing `1` as an argument to `flush` would cause an error because `flush` does not accept any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed. Additionally, passing `undefined` as an argument to `flush` would cause an error because `flush` does not accept any arguments.

DONE.
