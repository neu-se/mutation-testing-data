  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object with the deprecated property set to true, which would affect the behavior of the deliverCountry function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezonesForCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of a single country object, which would affect the behavior of the getCountriesForTimezone function.

DONE.
