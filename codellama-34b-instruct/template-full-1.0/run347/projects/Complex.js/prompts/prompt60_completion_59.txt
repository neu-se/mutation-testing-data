  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the 'r' property of the 'a' object, which would change the calculation of the hypotenuse in the logHypot() function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the 'phi' property of the 'a' object, which is not used in the calculation of the hypotenuse in the logHypot() function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the 'a' variable, which is used in the calculation of the hypotenuse in the logHypot() function.

DONE.
