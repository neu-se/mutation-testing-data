 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `inverted.chop`, is missing the parentheses to actually call the `chop` method, making it a no-op. By adding the parentheses, the `chop` method will be called, potentially changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.pop;
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.pop` is accessing the `pop` property of the `inverted` object, which is likely not defined. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError: inverted.pop is not a function` or similar error, changing the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.prototype.chop.call(inverted);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `ch
