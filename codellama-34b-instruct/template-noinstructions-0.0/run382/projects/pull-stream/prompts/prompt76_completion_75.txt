  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now always `false`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, even if `abort` was originally `true`. This could cause the `read` function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now always `true`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the second argument, even if `done` was originally `false`. This could cause the `read` function to behave differently than expected.
