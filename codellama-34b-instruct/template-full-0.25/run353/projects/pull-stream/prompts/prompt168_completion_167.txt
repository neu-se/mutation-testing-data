  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort()` is a function call. The function call would execute the function and return its result, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort.call(this)` is a function call with a specific `this` context. The function call would execute the function with the specified `this` context, which may not be the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while `onAbort.apply(this, arguments)` is a function
