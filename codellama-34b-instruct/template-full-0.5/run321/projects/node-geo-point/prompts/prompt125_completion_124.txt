  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points using the Pythagorean theorem, which would result in a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(this.latitude - point.latitude) + Math.abs(this.longitude - point.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points by adding the absolute difference in latitude and longitude, which would result in a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude,
