  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```yaml
stream >> 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `>>` is a bitwise right shift operator, which would change the value of `stream` to `0` every time it was called, even if the input stream was not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```yaml
null ?? stream
```
This would result in different behavior because `null ?? stream` is a null coalescing operator, which would return `stream` if it were not null, but return `null` if `stream` were null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```yaml
(() => {throw new Error('stream is not a valid value')})()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always throw an error with the message "stream is not a valid value", even if the input stream was valid.
