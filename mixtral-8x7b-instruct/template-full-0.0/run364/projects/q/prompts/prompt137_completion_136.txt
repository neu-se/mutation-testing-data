 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `ReturnValue` is defined, while the modified version always evaluates to `true`, bypassing the original condition's purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof globalThis.ReturnValue !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified version checks for `ReturnValue` in the global scope, which might not have the desired effect if `ReturnValue` is not defined globally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof someUndefinedVariable !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified version checks for the existence of an undefined variable `someUndefinedVariable`, which would not have the same effect as checking for the existence of `ReturnValue`.

DONE.
