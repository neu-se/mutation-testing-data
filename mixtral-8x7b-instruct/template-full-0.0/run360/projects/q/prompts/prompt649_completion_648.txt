 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, eval(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval(args)` executes the string `args` as JavaScript code, which can lead to unexpected results or errors, unlike the original code which treats `args` as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [window[name], args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `window` object's property with the name of `name` instead of the method of the object, which can cause a `TypeError: Cannot read property 'post' of undefined` if the property does not exist on the `window` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "POST" is not equal to "post", which can cause the `dispatch` method to fail to find the correct operation, leading to
