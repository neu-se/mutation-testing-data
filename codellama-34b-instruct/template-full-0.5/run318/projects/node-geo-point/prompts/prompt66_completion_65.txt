  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function is used to calculate the arctangent of `y` and `x`, which is the bearing between the two points. Replacing it with `cos(θ)` would give the cosine of the bearing, which is not the same as the bearing itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function is used to calculate the arctangent of `y` and `x`, which is the bearing between the two points. Replacing it with `sin(θ)` would give the sine of the bearing, which is not the same as the bearing itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function is used to calculate the arctangent of `y` and `x`, which is the bearing
