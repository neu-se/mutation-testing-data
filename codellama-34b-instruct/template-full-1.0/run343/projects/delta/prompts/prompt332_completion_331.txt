  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(null)
```
This would result in an error because `AttributeMap.invert` expects an `AttributeMap` object as its first argument, but `null` is not an object and does not have any properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is treated as an empty `AttributeMap` object, whereas `null` is treated as a non-existent `AttributeMap` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert({})
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty `AttributeMap` object has no attributes and cannot be inverted, whereas a non-empty `AttributeMap` object can be inverted.

DONE.
