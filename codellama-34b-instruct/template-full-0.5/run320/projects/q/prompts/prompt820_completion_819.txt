  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause issues if the callback function expects the arguments to be in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first element of the `progress` array as the third argument to the callback function, which could cause issues if the function expects an array of progress values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a copy of the `progress` array as the third argument to the callback function, which could cause issues if the function expects a reference to the original array.

DONE.
