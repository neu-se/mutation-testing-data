  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter--;
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be decremented instead of incremented, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be truncated by an additional character, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack = e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be truncated by an additional two characters, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different stack trace.

DONE.
