  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the case where `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement considers the case where `op.attributes` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the case where `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement considers the case where `op.attributes` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the case where `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement considers the case where `op.attributes` is not `undefined`.

DONE.
