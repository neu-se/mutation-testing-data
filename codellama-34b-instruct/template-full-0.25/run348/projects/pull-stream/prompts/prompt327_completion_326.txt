  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the `end` parameter is `false`. In the original code, `end` is returned directly, which would allow the function to return `false` if necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `end` parameter is `true`. In the original code, `end` is returned directly, which would allow the function to return `true` if necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the `end` parameter, which would cause the function to return `true` if `end` is `false`, and `false` if `end` is `true`. In the original code, `end` is returned directly, which would allow the function to return the correct value based on
