  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause it to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http` or `https` prefix would be excluded from the match, allowing for matches to begin with `https` instead of just `http`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:http|https):\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http` or `https` prefix would be included in a non-capturing group, allowing for matches to begin with either `http` or `https`.

DONE.
