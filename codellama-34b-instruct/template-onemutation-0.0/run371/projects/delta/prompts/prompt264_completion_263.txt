  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the attributes of `thisOp` and `otherOp` instead of the attributes of `thisOp` and `otherOp.attributes`, which is the intended behavior.
