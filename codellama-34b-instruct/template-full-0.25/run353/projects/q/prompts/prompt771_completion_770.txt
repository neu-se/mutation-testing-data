  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would not return an array of promises in the same way that `allSettled` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would not return an array of promises in the same way that `allSettled` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would not return an array of promises in the same way that `allSettled` does.

DONE.
