  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is expected to be called with an error object as its first argument, while `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is expected to be called with an error object as its first argument, while `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a callback function that is expected to be called with an error object as its first argument, while `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console and does not take any arguments.

DONE.
