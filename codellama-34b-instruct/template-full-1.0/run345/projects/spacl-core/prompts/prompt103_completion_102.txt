  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path || verb == ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(path || verb) == ctx`, which would always return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb == ctx && path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `verb == (ctx && path)`, which would return `true` only if both `verb` and `path` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 ctx ? path != verb : path
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator `?:` has higher precedence than the equality operators `==` and `!=`, so the expression would be evaluated as `ctx ? (path != verb) : path`, which would return the result of the comparison between `path` and `
