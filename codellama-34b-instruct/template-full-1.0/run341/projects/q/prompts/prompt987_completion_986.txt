  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is not defined in this scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object (in non-strict mode), or `undefined` (in strict mode), which is not an array and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, 42]
```
This would result in different behavior because the number `42` is not an array and would cause an error.

DONE.
