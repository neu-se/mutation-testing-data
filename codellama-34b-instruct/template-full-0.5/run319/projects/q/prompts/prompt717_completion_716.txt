  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "keys" is a valid method that returns the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "keys" is a valid method that returns the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filter"
```
This would result in different behavior because "filter" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "keys" is a valid method that returns the keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
