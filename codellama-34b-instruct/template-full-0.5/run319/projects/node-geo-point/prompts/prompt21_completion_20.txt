  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are `undefined` instead of checking if they are missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === null || object.longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are `null` instead of checking if they are missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') || object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are missing, `undefined`, or `null`.

DONE.
