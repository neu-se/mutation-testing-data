  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the array itself, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, nodeArgs.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `nodeArgs` array that excludes the last element, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
