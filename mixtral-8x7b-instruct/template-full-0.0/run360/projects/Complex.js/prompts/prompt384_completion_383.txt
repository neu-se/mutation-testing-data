 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now have a division operation, which could raise a division-by-zero error if `b` is 0, whereas the original expression would simply return 0 for the `im` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now always return a positive value for the `im` property, whereas the original expression could return a negative value if `b` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now square `b`, whereas the original expression simply returns `b` for the `im` property. This could lead to different results when `b` is a complex number, as the square of a complex number is not the same as the number itself.

DONE.
