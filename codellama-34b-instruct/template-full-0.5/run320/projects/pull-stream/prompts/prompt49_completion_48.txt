  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to iterate over different elements in the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the `arguments` array in reverse order, which could cause the loop to iterate over different elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the `arguments` array in reverse order, but would start from the last element instead of the first.

DONE.
