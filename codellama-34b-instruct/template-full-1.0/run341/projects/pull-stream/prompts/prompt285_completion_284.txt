  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = !end ? mapper(data) : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `end` instead of `null` when `mapper(data)` throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = !end ? null : mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of `mapper(data)` when `!end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = !end && mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` instead of `null` when `!end`.

DONE.
