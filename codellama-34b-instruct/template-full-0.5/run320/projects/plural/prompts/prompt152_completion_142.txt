  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would always return the singular form of the word, regardless of the value of `num`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the value of `num`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `num`.

DONE.
