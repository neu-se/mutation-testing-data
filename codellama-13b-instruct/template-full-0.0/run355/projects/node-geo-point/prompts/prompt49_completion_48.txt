  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values of the second point are swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is calculated based on the longitude values of the two points, rather than their latitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is calculated based on a random value, rather than the latitude and longitude values of the two points.

DONE.
