  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i += 2` increments the value of `i` by 2, whereas `++i` increments the value of `i` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because `i--` decrements the value of `i` by 1, whereas `++i` increments the value of `i` by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because `i = i + 100` sets the value of `i` to 100 more than its original value, whereas `++i` increments the value of `i` by 1.

DONE.
