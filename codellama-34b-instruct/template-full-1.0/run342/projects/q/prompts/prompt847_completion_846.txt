  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `object`, which is an argument to the function, while this replacement uses the number 42, which is a constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `object`, which is an argument to the function, while this replacement uses the string "Hello, world!", which is a constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `object`, which is an argument to the function, while this replacement uses the boolean value `false`, which is a constant.

DONE.
