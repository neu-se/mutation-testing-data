  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is already resolved with the value, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value only after it has been processed by the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).catch(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is already resolved with the value, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value only after it has been processed by the `catch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
