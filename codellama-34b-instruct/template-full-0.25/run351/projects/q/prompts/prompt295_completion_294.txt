  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would not cause the same error as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would not cause the same error as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a different error message to be thrown, which would not be the same as the original error message.

DONE.
