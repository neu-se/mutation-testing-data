 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a division by zero error when r is equal to 1 or -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the result to radians, while the original code returns a value in degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
acos(-r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the negative of the original result, which can lead to incorrect distance calculations.

DONE.
