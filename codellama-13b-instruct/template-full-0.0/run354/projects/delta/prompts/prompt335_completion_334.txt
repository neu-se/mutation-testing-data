  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the same attributes object to the `AttributeMap.invert()` method, which would result in the same attributes being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing the attributes object from the `otherOp` object to the `AttributeMap.invert()` method, which would result in different attributes being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be passing a null value to the `AttributeMap.invert()` method, which would result in an empty attributes object being returned.

DONE.
