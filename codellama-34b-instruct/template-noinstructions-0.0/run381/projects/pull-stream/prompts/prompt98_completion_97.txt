  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment only called the callback function with the error as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment only called the callback function with the error as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with only the error as an argument, whereas the original code fragment called the callback function with both the error and the data.

DONE.
