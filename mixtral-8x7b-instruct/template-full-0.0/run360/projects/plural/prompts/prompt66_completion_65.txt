 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memos' => 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the original addRule, changing the expected 'memos' plural form to 'memo'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'o') }
