  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.id` is a string, while `!country` is a boolean. This would cause the `memoizeCountry` function to always return `undefined`, even if the country is already memoized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.name` is a string, while `!country` is a boolean. This would cause the `memoizeCountry` function to always return `undefined`, even if the country is already memoized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.timezones.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.timezones.length` is a number, while `!country` is a boolean. This would cause the `memoizeCountry` function to always return `undefined`, even if the country is already memoized.

DONE.
