  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calling the `inspect` method on the `promise` object, which would likely return a different value than the `inspect` function on its own.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the `promise` object to the `inspect` function, which would likely return a different value than passing the `inspect` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calling the `inspect` function without any arguments, which would likely return a different value than passing the `promise` object to the `inspect` function.

DONE.
