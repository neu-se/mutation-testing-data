  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Test error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute, while the new code would throw an error and stop execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute, while the new code would return and stop execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute, while the new code would return undefined and stop execution.

DONE.
