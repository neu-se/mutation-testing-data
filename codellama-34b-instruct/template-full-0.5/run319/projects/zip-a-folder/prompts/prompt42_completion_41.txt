This would result in different behavior because `file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, whereas `glob` is a method that adds files to the archive based on a glob pattern. Using `file` would result in a different set of files being added to the archive.

This would result in different behavior because `directory` is a method that adds a directory to the archive, whereas `glob` is a method that adds files to the archive based on a glob pattern. Using `directory` would result in a different set of files being added to the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a method that finalizes the archive, whereas `glob` is a method that adds files to the archive based on a glob pattern. Using `finalize` would result in a different set
