  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct a URL object, and replacing it with a hardcoded URL would cause the `parse` function to use a different URL than the one intended by the developer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path/to/resource"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct a URL object, and replacing it with a URL that includes a path would cause the `parse` function to use a different URL than the one intended by the developer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com?query=param"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct a URL object, and replacing it with a URL that includes a query string would cause the `parse` function to use a different URL than the one intended
