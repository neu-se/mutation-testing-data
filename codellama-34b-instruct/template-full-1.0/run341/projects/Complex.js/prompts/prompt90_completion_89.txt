  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulus operator is now using 3 instead of 2, which would change the resulting operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the plus operator was changed to a minus operator, and the index of the token was changed from `i + 1` to `i - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(tokens[i + 1] % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulus operator was moved to the first token, and the index of the token was changed from `i + 1` to `i - 1`.

DONE.
