  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `country === null` would only be true if `country` is null or undefined, whereas `!country` would be true if `country` is any falsy value, such as an empty object or an empty string.

DONE.
