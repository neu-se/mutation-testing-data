  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the `sinh` and `cosh` functions to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and using it in place of `Math.cos` would cause the `sinh` and `cosh` functions to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, and using it in place of `Math.cos` would cause the `sinh` and `cosh` functions to return incorrect results.

DONE.
