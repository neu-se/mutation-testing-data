 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zipArchive.directory()` method would always include the source directory in the archive, even if it is empty. Originally, it would not include the source directory if it's empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.bulk([{src, dest: ''}])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an empty entry with the source directory name to the archive, even if it is empty. This is different from the original behavior where an empty source directory is not added to the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.glob('**/*', {cwd: src, dot: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include hidden files in the archive, while the original code does not.

DONE.
