  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is incremented by 1, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is multiplied by 2, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` variable is decremented by 1, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

DONE.
