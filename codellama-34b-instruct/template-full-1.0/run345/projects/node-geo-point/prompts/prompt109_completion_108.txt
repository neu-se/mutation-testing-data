  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2,zoom -1)
```
This would result in different behavior, because it would increase the zoom level exponentially.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(zoom >1 ? 2:1)
```
This would result in different behavior, because it would check if zoom is greater than 1 and then apply the correct formula based on the result.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(zoom + 1) % 2 === 0? 2:1
```
This would result in different behavior, because it would check if zoom is odd or even and then apply the correct formula based on the result.
DONE.
