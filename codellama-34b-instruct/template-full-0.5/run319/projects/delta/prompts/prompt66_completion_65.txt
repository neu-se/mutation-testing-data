  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for less than or equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks for strictly less than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for less than or equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks for greater than or equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for less than or equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks for inequality with zero.

DONE.
