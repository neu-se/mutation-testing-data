 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 's' as the plural suffix, regardless of the value of `num`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the actual value of `num`. This could lead to incorrect pluralization based on the value of `num`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the current object, which is the string being pluralized. This could lead to incorrect pluralization if the code relies on the value of `num` being passed as an argument to the `plural` function.

DONE.
