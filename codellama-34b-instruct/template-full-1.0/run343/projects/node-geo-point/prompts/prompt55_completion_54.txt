  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables, and swapping them changes the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
マインナス機
```
This would result in different behavior because `マインナス機` is a valid JavaScript identifier, but it has a different meaning in the context of the `calculateBearing` method. It could potentially cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
180
```
This would result in different behavior because `180` is a hardcoded value, and it would change the calculation of the bearing. It could potentially cause unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
