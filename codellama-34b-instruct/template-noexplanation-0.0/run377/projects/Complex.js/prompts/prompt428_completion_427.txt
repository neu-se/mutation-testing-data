  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This modification will ensure that the `places` variable is never equal to zero, which could cause the `Math.pow` function to return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.PI
```
This modification will ensure that the `places` variable is never equal to zero, and will also introduce a non-integer value that may cause the `Math.pow` function to return a non-integer result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.E
```
This modification will ensure that the `places` variable is never equal to zero, and will also introduce a non-integer value that may cause the `Math.pow` function to return a non-integer result.

DONE.
