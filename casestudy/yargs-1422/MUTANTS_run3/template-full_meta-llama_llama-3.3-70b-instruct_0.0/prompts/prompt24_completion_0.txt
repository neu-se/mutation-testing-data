Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
middleware.applyBeforeValidation === beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the middleware to be skipped when its `applyBeforeValidation` property matches the `beforeValidation` parameter, instead of when they don't match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `middleware.applyBeforeValidation` property and always skips the middleware when `beforeValidation` is false, regardless of the middleware's configuration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof middleware.applyBeforeValidation === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `applyBeforeValidation` property is undefined, instead of comparing its value to the `beforeValidation` parameter, potentially skipping middlewares that don't have this property set.

DONE.
