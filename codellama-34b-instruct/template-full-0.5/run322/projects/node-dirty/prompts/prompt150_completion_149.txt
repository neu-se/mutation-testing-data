  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the callback function `cb` with an error argument, while the new code fragment would not call the callback function at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the callback function `cb` with an error argument, while the new code fragment would throw an error instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { cb() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was calling the callback function `cb` with an error argument, while the new code fragment would call the callback function without any arguments.

DONE.
