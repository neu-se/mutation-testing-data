  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` is a method that replaces all occurrences of a substring in a string, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/#.*/g` matches any character that is not a newline, whereas the original regular expression `/#.*$/` only matches characters up to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^#.*/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^#.*/` matches any character that is not a newline, whereas the original regular expression `/#.*$/` only matches characters up to the end of the string.

DONE.
