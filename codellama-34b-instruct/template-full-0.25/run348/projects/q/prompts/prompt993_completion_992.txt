  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this code fragment passes `null` as the argument to `defer`, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this code fragment passes `undefined` as the argument to `defer`, which would also result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this code fragment passes a new error object as the argument to `defer`, which would also result in an error.

DONE.
