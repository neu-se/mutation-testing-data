  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error in the read stream, whereas the original code emits the `read_close` event when the read stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the original code emits the `read_close` event when the read stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the read stream has reached the end of the file, whereas the original code emits the `read_close` event when the read stream is closed.

DONE.
