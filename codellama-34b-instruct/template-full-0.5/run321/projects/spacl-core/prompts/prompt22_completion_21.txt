  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the superclass, which may not have the same implementation as the subclass's `Symbol.match` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the current object, which may not have the same implementation as the `Symbol.match` method on the superclass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Matcher.prototype[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `Matcher` prototype object, which may not have the same implementation as the `Symbol.match` method on the current object or the superclass.

DONE.
