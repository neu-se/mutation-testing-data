  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the operation, while `peekLength` is a getter that returns the length property of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is iterating over the other delta, while `thisIter` is iterating over the current delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object that contains the operation to be performed, while `thisOp` is an object that contains the current operation.

DONE.
