  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not calling the `peekType` method, and the returned value would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not calling the `peekLength` method, and the returned value would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekOp()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not calling the `peekOp` method, and the returned value would be different.

DONE.
