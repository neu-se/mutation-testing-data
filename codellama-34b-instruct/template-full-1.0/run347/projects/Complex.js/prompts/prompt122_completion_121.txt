  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the check for Infinity in the divisor to only consider the divisor's real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the case where both the dividend and divisor are Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ((this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the case where the dividend is Infinity and the divisor is zero, or vice versa.

DONE.
