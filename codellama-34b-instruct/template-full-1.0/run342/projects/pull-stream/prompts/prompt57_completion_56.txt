  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr[item]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr[item]` would refer to the value of `arr` at the index of `item`, whereas the original code fragment `item` would refer to the value of the variable `item`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.push(item * 2)` would push the value of `item` multiplied by 2 onto the array `arr`, whereas the original code fragment `arr.push(item)` would push the value of `item` onto the array `arr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(item, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice(item, 1)` would remove the element at the index of `item` from the array `arr`, whereas the original code fragment `arr.push(item)` would push the
