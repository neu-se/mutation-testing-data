  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the imaginary part to be negated, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the imaginary part to be incremented, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the imaginary part to be doubled, resulting in a different complex number.

DONE.
