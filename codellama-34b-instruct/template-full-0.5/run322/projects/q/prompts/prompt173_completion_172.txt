  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of an array, whereas the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of an array, whereas the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas the `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
