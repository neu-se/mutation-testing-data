  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"console.log()"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `b` was an object before deleting its `delete` property, but with `"console.log()"`, the `delete` property would be deleted regardless of whether `b` is an object or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `b` was an object before deleting its `delete` property, but with `"null"`, the `delete` property would be deleted regardless of whether `b` is an object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `b` was an object before deleting its `delete` property, but with `"undefined"`, the `delete` property would be deleted regardless of whether `b` is an object or not.

DONE.
