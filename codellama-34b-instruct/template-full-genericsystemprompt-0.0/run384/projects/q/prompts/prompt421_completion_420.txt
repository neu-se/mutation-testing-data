  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `value` is not a promise, and `false` when it is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the `value` is an object with a `then` method, which is a more general check than `isPromise`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for more values, including objects that are not promises but have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function checks if the `value` is a pending promise, which means it has not been resolved or rejected yet.
