  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code had no explicit argument passed to the `next()` method, which means it would advance the iterator by one position by default. However, by passing the argument `1`, the iterator would advance by one position only if the current element is truthy, otherwise it would stay at the same position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code had no explicit argument passed to the `next()` method, which means it would advance the iterator by one position by default. However, by passing the argument `2`, the iterator would advance by two positions only if the current element is truthy, otherwise it would stay at the same position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peek().length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code had no explicit argument passed to the
