Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 for insert operations and 1 for delete or retain operations, leading to an incorrect total length calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert ? Op.length(elem) + 1 : Op.length(elem)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add 1 to the length for every insert operation, inflating the total length count.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete ? Op.length(elem) : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only count the length of delete operations and ignore insert and retain operations, resulting in an inaccurate length calculation.

DONE.
