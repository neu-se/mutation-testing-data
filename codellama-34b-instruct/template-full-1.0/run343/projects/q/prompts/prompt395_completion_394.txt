  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this. thenNotify
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenNotify` is not a method of the `Promise` class, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this. sayRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `sayRejected` is not a method of the `Promise` class, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this. sayResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `sayResolve` is not a method of the `Promise` class, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
