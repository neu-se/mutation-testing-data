  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `read` to a different number, potentially causing the `switch` statement to evaluate to a different case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of `read` to a different number, potentially causing the `switch` statement to evaluate to a different case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `read` to a different number, potentially causing the `switch` statement to evaluate to a different case.

DONE.
