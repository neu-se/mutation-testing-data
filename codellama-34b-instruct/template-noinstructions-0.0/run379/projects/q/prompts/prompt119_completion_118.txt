  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the original function's context. In this case, the original function is `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, which is a method that checks if an object has a property with the given name. By binding this method to the `Object.prototype` context, we can use it as a standalone function that takes an object and a property name as arguments, and returns `true` if the object has the property and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(Object.prototype))
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that is bound to a specific context. In this case, we are binding the `hasOwnProperty` method to the `Object.prototype
