  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, leading to an infinite loop if `max` is not reached.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, leading to a different final value of `i` if `max` is reached.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would set `i` to `max` instead of incrementing it, leading to a different final value of `i` if `max` is reached.

DONE.
