  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of an exception object is not always the same as the exception itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of an exception object is not always the same as the exception itself and may contain additional information about the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of an exception object is not always the same as the exception itself and may return a string representation of the exception.

DONE.
