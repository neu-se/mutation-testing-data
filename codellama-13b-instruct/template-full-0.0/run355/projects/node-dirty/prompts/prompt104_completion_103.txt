  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key in the data map to undefined, while the new code fragment sets the value of the key to undefined directly. This could potentially cause issues if the data map is used for other purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key in the data map to undefined, while the new code fragment deletes the key from the data map entirely. This could potentially cause issues if the data map is used for other purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the key in the data map to undefined, while the new code fragment sets the value of the key to null. This could potentially cause issues if the data
