  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a truthy value to be returned, but `false` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a truthy value to be returned, but `null` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a truthy value to be returned, but `undefined` is a falsy value.

DONE.
