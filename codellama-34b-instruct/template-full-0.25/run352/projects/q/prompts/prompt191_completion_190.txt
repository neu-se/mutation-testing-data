  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the column number in addition to the line number, which could affect the filtering of stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the column and line numbers, as well as the file name, which could affect the filtering of stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):(\d+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would capture the column, line, and file name, as well as an additional number, which could affect the filtering of stack traces.

DONE.
