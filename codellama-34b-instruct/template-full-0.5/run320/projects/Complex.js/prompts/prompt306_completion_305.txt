  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the resulting expression would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now include an additional term, which would change the result of the division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would now include a multiplication term, which would change the result of the division.

DONE.
