  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function `value[name]` with `args` as arguments, rather than applying `args` as an argument to the function `value[name]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that, when called, would call `value[name]` with `args` as its `this` value, rather than calling `value[name]` with `args` as its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name] + args;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `value[name]` and `args` as strings, rather than calling `value[name]` with `args` as its arguments.

DONE.
