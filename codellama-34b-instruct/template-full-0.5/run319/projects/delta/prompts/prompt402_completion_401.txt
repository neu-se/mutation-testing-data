  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the second key of the `otherData` object instead of the first key, which could lead to unexpected results if the object has more than one key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the length of the `otherData` object instead of the first key, which could lead to unexpected results if the object has more than one key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `embedType` is not equal to the first key of the `otherData` object, which could lead to unexpected results if the object has more than one key.

DONE.
