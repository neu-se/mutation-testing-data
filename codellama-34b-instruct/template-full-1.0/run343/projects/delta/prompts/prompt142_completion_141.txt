  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra character to the `firstLeft` variable, potentially causing the loop to run an additional iteration or two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain + firstOther.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `firstOther.delete` to `firstLeft`, potentially causing the loop to run more or fewer iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain - firstOther.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `firstOther.delete` from `firstLeft`, potentially causing the loop to run more or fewer iterations.

DONE.
