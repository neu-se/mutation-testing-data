  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, whereas `null` is a truthy value. If the `end` parameter is `undefined`, the function will return `cb(undefined, generate())`, which is different from the original behavior of returning `cb(null, generate())`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number". If the `end` parameter is `NaN`, the function will return `cb(NaN, generate())`, which is different from the original behavior of returning `cb(null, generate())`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is a truthy value. If the `end` parameter is `{}`, the function will return `cb({}, generate())`, which is different from the original behavior of
