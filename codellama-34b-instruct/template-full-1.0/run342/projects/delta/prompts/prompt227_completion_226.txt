  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!component[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator is being applied to the first element of the `component` array, which is likely not what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `component` array is being referenced instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.component[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because a property named `component` is being referenced using the `this` keyword, which likely does not exist on the `Delta` class.

DONE.
