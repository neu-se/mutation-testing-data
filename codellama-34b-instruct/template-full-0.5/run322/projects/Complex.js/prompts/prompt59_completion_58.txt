  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Number.isFinite`, causing the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed even if the input is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite. This would cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed even if the input is not `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Number.isNaN`, causing the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed even if the input is not `NaN`.

DONE.
