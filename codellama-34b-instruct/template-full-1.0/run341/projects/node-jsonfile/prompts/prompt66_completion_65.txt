  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0001/
```
This would result in different behavior because /u0001/ matches the code point at the beginning of the string, which is different from the original /uFEFF/ that matches the Unicode Byte Order Mark.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/g^\uFEFF/
```
This would result in different behavior because the /g at the beginning of the regex pattern would make it match all occurrences of the Unicode Byte Order Mark, instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF./
```
This would result in different behavior because the . at the end of the regex pattern would match any character after the Unicode Byte Order Mark, instead of just the newline character.

DONE.
