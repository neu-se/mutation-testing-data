  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the decoded basename as-is, while this modified code fragment converts it to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the decoded basename, while this modified code fragment uses the basename of the destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the basename of the destination path, while this modified code fragment uses the directory name of the destination path.

DONE.
