 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `otherOp.attributes` with `null`, which might cause issues if the following code expects an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `insert` property of `otherOp` instead of the `attributes` property, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the values are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
