  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because `close` is not a valid function in the context of the `Dirty` class, and would therefore throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prematurely emit the `drain` event, causing the code to execute with a potentially incorrect state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the number of in-flight writes to 0, causing the code to potentially miss writes that haven't been processed yet.

DONE.
