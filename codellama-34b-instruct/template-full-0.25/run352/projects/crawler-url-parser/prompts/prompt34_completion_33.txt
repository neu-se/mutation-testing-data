  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument passed to `URL.parse` would cause the function to not parse the query string, which would result in the `search` property of the returned object being `null`, even if the URL contains a query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument passed to `URL.parse` would cause the function to not parse the path, which would result in the `pathname` property of the returned object being `null`, even if the URL contains a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `false` arguments passed to `URL.parse` would cause the function to not parse the query string or the path, which
