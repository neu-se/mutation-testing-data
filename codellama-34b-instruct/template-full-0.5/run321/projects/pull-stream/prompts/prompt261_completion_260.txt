  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error object as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment only called the callback function with the error object as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error object as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment only called the callback function with the error object as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error object as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment only called the callback function with the error object as the second argument.

DONE.
