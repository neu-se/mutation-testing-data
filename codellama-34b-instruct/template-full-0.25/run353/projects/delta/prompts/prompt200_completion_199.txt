  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest` method returns the remaining ops in the iterator, starting from the current position, and passing 0 as the argument would cause the method to return an empty array, which would result in the `concat` method returning an empty delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest` method returns the remaining ops in the iterator, starting from the current position, and passing 1 as the argument would cause the method to return an array with the first op removed, which would result in the `concat` method returning a delta with the first op removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest` method returns the remaining ops in the iterator, starting from the current position, and passing 2 as the argument would cause the
