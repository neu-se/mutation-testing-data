  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds `1` to the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `abort` and `true` are `true`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `false`.

DONE.
