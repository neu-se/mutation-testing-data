  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong_dest' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the `dest` variable, which is used to create the write stream. This would cause the downloaded file to be saved to a different location than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to `null`, which would cause the `createWriteStream` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'dest' + '_' + Math.random() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the `dest` variable, which is used to create the write stream. This would cause the downloaded file to be saved to a different location than expected, and the random value would ensure that the file is not overwritten if it already exists.
