Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value from `true` to `false`, which may affect any logic that relies on the truthiness of the value returned by the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `true` could lead to unexpected results in the callback, especially if the callback is designed to handle truthy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `true` may cause the callback to behave differently, particularly if it expects a defined value to process.

DONE.
