  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error and stop the execution of the rest of the code, whereas the original code would simply call the `task` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` function twice, whereas the original code would only call it once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` function with a `null` argument, whereas the original code would not pass any arguments to the function.

DONE.
