  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes the file immediately, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that queues the write operation for later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str, options, callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` takes a callback function as its last argument, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` does not take any callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` takes an options object as its third argument, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` does not take any options object.

DONE.
