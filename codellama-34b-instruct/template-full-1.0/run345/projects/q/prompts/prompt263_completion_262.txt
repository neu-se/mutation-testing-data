  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(anotherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with a different value than the one passed to the `resolve` method.

DONE.
