  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ms` and `error` variables, which are not defined in the scope of the function. Replacing the variables with the same names would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ms` variable to calculate the timeout, while the replaced code uses the `timeout` variable. This could cause the timeout to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `error` variable to pass an error object to the `reject` method, while the replaced code creates a new error object using the `Error` constructor. This could cause the error object to be different from the one originally intended.

DONE.
