  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string representation of the error, while `error.stack` is a string representation of the error stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.toString()` returns a string representation of the error and its properties, while `error.stack` only returns the error stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.name` returns the name of the error, while `error.stack` returns the error stack trace.

DONE.
