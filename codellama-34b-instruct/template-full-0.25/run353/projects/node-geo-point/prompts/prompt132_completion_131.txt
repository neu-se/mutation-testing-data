  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive a `null` value as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an `undefined` value as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an empty object as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
