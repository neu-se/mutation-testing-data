  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `a` before it is used in the `Math.cos` function, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of `a` before it is used in the `Math.cos` function, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `a` before it is used in the `Math.cos` function, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

DONE.
