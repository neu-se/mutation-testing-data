  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would invoke the function with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method than "apply" and would create a new function with a bound context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fapply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "fapply" is a different method than "apply" and would apply the function to a promise, which could have different behavior than applying the function to a resolved value.

DONE.
