  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not a promise, so it would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, promise.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` property of the `promise` object is not the same as the `reason` variable passed to the `trackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array is not the same as the `unhandledRejections` array, so the `promise` object would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

DONE.
