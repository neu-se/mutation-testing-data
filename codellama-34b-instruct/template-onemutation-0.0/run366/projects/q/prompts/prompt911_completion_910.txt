  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by merging two or more arrays, while `slice` creates a new array by copying a portion of an existing array. In this case, `slice` would create a new array containing only the elements of `baseArgs`, while `concat` would create a new array containing the elements of `baseArgs` followed by the elements of `array_slice(arguments)`.
