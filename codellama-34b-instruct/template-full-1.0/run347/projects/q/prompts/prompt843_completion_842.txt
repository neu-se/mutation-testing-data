  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is not a valid timeout value, and it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is falsy, and it would be treated as 0, which would also cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is an invalid timeout value, and it would cause an error.

DONE.
