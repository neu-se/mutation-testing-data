  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function and `onEnd()` would call the function, whereas the original code fragment `onEnd` would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd(true)` would call the `onEnd` function with the argument `true`, whereas the original code fragment `onEnd` would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd(false)` would call the `onEnd` function with the argument `false`, whereas the original code fragment `onEnd` would simply refer to the function without calling it.

DONE.
