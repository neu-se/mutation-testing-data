  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be escaped, which would cause the matcher to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
