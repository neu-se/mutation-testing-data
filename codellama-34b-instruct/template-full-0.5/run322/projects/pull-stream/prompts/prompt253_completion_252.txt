  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream. Using `nextStream` instead of `nextChunk` would cause the code to read the next stream instead of the next chunk, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream, whereas `nextChunk` is a reference to the function itself. Using `nextChunk()` instead of `nextChunk` would cause the code to call the function immediately, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value that is not a function, whereas `nextChunk` is a reference
