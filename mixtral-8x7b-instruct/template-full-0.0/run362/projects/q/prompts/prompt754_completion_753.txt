 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is passed to the `any` function, which would immediately resolve the promise with an empty array instead of waiting for the first resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` is passed to the `any` function, which would immediately resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of waiting for the first resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return "error"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a function returning a string is passed to the `any` function, which would always result in a rejection with an error message instead of waiting for the first resolved promise.

DONE.
