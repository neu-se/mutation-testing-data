  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this instanceof Complex` would always return `true`, even if the object is not an instance of `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof this` would always return `'object'`, even if the object is not an instance of `Complex`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor === Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` would always return `Complex`, even if the object is not an instance of `Complex`.

DONE.
