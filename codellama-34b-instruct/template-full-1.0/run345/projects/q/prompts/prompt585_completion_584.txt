  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[continuer](generator);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which is likely not the intended target for the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer(generator)(generator);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function call was `continuer(verb, arg)`, but now it is called with two arguments, which may cause a different execution path or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer(verb, generator);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function call was `continuer(verb, arg)`, but now it is called with `generator` as the second argument, which may cause a different execution path or error.

DONE.
