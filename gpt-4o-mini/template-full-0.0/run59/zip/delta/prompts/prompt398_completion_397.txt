Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it causes the code to skip the current operation from `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations as it ignores the intended operation from the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation from `otherIter` without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times, leading to unexpected results in the transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the operation with a retain of zero, which effectively removes any content at that position instead of preserving the intended operation from `otherOp`, altering the final output of the transformation.

DONE.
