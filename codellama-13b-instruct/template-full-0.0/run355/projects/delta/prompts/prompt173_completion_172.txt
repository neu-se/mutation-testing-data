  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, but the `+ 1` adds 1 to that length, which could cause the `delta.ops` array to grow by 1 element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, but the `- 1` subtracts 1 from that length, which could cause the `delta.ops` array to shrink by 1 element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` function returns the length of the next operation in the `
