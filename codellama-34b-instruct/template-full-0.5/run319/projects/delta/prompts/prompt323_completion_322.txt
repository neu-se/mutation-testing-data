  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseIndex` is the index of the current line in the `base` Delta, while `baseIndex + 1` is the index of the next line. If the `eachLine` method is called with a `newline` argument that does not match the actual newline character used in the `base` Delta, the method will not correctly iterate over the lines in the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseIndex` is the index of the current line in the `base` Delta, while `baseIndex - 1` is the index of the previous line. If the `eachLine` method is called with a `newline` argument that does not match the actual newline character used in the `base` Delta, the method will not correctly iterate over the lines in the Delta.
