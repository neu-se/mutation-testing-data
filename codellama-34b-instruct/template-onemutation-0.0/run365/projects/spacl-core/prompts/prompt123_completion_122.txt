  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.test(path)` would return a boolean value indicating whether the path matches the regular expression, whereas `this.regex` would return the regular expression object itself.

DONE.
