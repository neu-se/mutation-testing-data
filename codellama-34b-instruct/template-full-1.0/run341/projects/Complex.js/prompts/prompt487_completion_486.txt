  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be replaced with the `1` constant, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be replaced with the `0` constant, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be replaced with the `-1` constant, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to `-1`.

DONE.
