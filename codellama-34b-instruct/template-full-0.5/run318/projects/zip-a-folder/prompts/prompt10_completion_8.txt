  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `isGlob` function, potentially causing the code to archive the wrong files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isGlob` function with the `src` argument, potentially causing the code to archive different files than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isGlob` function with `undefined` as an argument, potentially causing the code to throw an error or archive different files than intended.

DONE.
