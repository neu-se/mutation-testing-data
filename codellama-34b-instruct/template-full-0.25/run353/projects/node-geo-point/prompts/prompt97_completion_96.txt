  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a different variable than `y`, and it is not clear what value `x` holds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(θ)` is a different value than `y`, and it is not clear what value `cos(θ)` holds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(θ)` is a different value than `y`, and it is not clear what value `sin(θ)` holds.

DONE.
