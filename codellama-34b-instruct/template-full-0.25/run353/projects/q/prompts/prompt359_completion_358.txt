  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with `null` instead of `value`, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with `undefined` instead of `value`, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would throw an error instead of returning a value, which could cause the promise chain to reject with an error instead of resolving with a value.

DONE.
