  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to the `θ` variable, which is the bearing in degrees, instead of the `φ1` variable, which is the latitude in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being applied to the `θ` variable, which is the bearing in degrees, instead of the `φ1` variable, which is the latitude in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * cos(δ) * cos(φ1)
