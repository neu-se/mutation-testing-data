  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `false` regardless of the type of `process`, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` if `process` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `process.emit` is not a function, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` if `process.emit` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `process` is undefined, whereas the original code would only evaluate to `true` if `process` is an object.

DONE.
