  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted` variable, which is a boolean value indicating whether the asynchronous operation was aborted or not. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to behave differently, as `null` is not a boolean value and would not trigger the same code path as the original fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted` variable, which is a boolean value indicating whether the asynchronous operation was aborted or not. Replacing it with `!aborted` would cause the code to behave differently, as the `!` operator negates the boolean value, making it `false` if the operation was aborted and `true` if it was not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted
