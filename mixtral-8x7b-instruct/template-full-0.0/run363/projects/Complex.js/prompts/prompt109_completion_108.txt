 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always raise a `DivideByZeroError` instead of checking if `this.re` or `this.im` is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the input is a finite number, even if it's not a valid complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(this.re) === '[object Number]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `this.re` is a number, and not check `this.im`.

DONE.
