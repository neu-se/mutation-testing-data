  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is not equal to 2, while this new code checks if the length is less than 2. This would cause the `TypeError` to be thrown for arrays with length 2 or more, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is not equal to 2, while this new code checks if the length is greater than 2. This would cause the `TypeError` to be thrown for arrays with length 2 or less, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the
