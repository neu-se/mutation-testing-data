  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into individual characters, reverse them, and then join them back into a string, which would effectively reverse the order of the path segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).map(segment => segment.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into individual segments, convert each segment to uppercase, and then return a new array of uppercase segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).filter(segment => segment.match(/[a-zA-Z]/))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into individual segments, filter out any segments that do not contain any letters, and then return a new array of filtered segments.
