  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of removing all elements up to and including the `atReport` index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove zero elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of removing all elements up to and including the `atReport` index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove 100 elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, instead of removing all elements up to and including the `atReport` index.

DONE.
