```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is being checked for being an instance of the `Error` class instead of being a string, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called even if `error` is not an error.

```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` variable is being checked for being a string and having a specific message, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be
