Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always compare `newOp.attributes` with an empty object, which will always return false unless `newOp.attributes` is also an empty object, thus potentially skipping the merging logic for attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it will compare `null` with `lastOp.attributes`, which will always return false, preventing any merging of attributes even when `lastOp.attributes` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes, newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it will compare `newOp.attributes` with itself, which will always return true, leading to incorrect merging logic that may not consider the previous operation's attributes.

DONE.
