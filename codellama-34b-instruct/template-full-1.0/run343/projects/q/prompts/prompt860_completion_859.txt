  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall().then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `fcall` on the `promise` object, but not pass any arguments to it, which could cause an error if the function expects arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall(error).then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `error` object as an argument to `fcall`, which could change the behavior of the function if it expects a specific argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value from the `then` method, which could be used downstream in the promise chain.

DONE.
