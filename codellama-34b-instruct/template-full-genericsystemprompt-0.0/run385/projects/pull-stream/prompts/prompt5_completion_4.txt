  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.map(function(through) { return through.toUpperCase(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would apply the `toUpperCase` method to each element in the `throughs` array, which would change the values of the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.filter(function(through) { return through.length > 5; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would only keep elements in the `throughs` array that have a length greater than 5, which would change the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reduce(function(acc, through) { return acc + through.length; }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function would accumulate the lengths of all the elements in the `throughs` array, which would produce a different result than the original
