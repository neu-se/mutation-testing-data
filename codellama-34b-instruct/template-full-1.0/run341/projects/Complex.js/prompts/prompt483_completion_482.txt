  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']()+false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isInfinite']()` would always return `false` instead of the expected `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` has higher precedence than `||`, so the condition would become `(this['isInfinite']() && true) || (this['isFinite']())`, which would always be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() + this['isFinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` has higher precedence than `||`, so the condition would become `(this['isInfinite']() + this['isFinite']()) || (this['isNT']())`, which would always be `true`.

DONE.
