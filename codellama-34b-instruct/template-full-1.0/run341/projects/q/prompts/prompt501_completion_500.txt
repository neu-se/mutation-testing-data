  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is a string, while void 0 is a special value that represents undefined. Using "undefined" may change the behavior of the code that depends on the typeof operator, as it would now see a string instead of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a different value than void 0. Any code that relies on the value of the placeholder to be void 0 would now see null instead, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1
```
This would result in different behavior because void 1 is a different value than void 0. Any code that relies on the value of the placeholder to be void 0 would now see a different value instead, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.


DONE.
