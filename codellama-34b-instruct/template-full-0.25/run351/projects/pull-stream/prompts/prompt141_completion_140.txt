  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result when called with `undefined` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result when called with `0` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result when called with `NaN` as the first argument.

DONE.
