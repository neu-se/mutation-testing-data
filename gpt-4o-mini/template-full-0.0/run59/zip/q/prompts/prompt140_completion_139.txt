Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to `p`, causing the loop to terminate immediately, whereas the original code checks if `p` is truthy, allowing the loop to continue if `p` is a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `undefined` to `p`, which is falsy, leading to the loop terminating immediately, unlike the original code that checks for truthiness.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns an empty object to `p`, which is truthy, but does not have a `source` property, causing the loop to potentially run indefinitely or throw an error when trying to access `p.source`, unlike the original code that checks for the existence of `p`.

DONE.
