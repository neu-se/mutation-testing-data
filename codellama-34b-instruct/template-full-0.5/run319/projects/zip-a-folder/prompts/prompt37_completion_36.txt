  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is negated, which means that the code will only run if the `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is compared to the boolean value `false`, which means that the code will only run if the `src` is not a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is compared to the boolean value `true`, which means that the code will only run if the `src` is not a glob.

DONE.
