  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the first element of the array to be removed, resulting in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat([null])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is called on the `nodeArgs` array with an extra argument `null`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
