 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(Math.E, this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(Math.E, this['re'])` calculates e raised to the power of `this['re']`, while `Math.exp(this['re'])` calculates the exponential function of `this['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `this['re']` is the real part of the current complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the imaginary part of the complex number, while `this['im']` is the imaginary part of the current complex number.

DONE.
