This would result in different behavior because `arg === ''` would return `true` if `arg` is an empty string, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg.length === 0` would return `true` if `arg` is an empty string or an empty array, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would only return `true` if `arg` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'object' && arg.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof arg === 'object' && arg.length === 0` would return `true` if `arg` is an empty array, while `typeof arg === 'string' &&
