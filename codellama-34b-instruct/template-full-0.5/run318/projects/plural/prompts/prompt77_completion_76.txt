  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the word, but in this case, it would return the same word, making the rule invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the word, but in this case, it would return a different word, making the rule incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `addRule` function is a function that returns the plural form of the word, but in this case, it would return a different function, making the rule incorrect.

DONE.
