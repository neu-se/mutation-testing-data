  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different argument, which would change the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is called with a different argument, which would change the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method is called with a different argument, which would change the resulting string.

DONE.
