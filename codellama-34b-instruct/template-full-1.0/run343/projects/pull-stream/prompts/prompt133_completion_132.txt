  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called, but the code would still execute and call the `cb` function after it, unlike the original code which only calls the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!cb` expression would yield the opposite result of the `cb` function call, potentially causing the stream to be consumed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cbNew = () => { console.log("New callback!"); cb(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function `cbNew` is defined which logs a message to the console before calling the original `cb` function, potentially causing a different behavior in the code that consumes the stream.

DONE.
