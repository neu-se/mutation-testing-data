  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest && typeof options.dest !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `options.dest` property is of type string, which would cause the `request` function to be called even if `options.dest` is not a valid destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest || !options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `options.url` property is not undefined, which would cause the `request` function to be called even if `options.dest` is not a valid destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest || options.url.indexOf('.') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `options.url` property contains a dot ('.') character, which would cause the `request` function to be called even if `options.dest` is not a valid destination
