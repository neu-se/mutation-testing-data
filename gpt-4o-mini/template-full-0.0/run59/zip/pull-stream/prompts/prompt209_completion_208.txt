Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the callback with `aborted` when `aborted` is false, effectively allowing the process to continue instead of stopping, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the callback with `aborted`, regardless of the actual state of the `aborted` variable, causing the function to behave as if it was always aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `data` is `null` instead of checking the `aborted` state, which could lead to incorrect handling of the data and potentially skipping the abort logic when it should be executed.

DONE.
