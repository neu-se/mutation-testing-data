  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object and contains the necessary `then` method, while this replacement only checks if `value` is an object, which may not necessarily be a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null && typeof value !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object and contains the necessary `then` method, while this replacement only checks if `value` is not `null` or `undefined`, which may not necessarily be a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) !== "[object Promise]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is a promise-like object and contains the necessary `then` method, while this replacement only checks if the string representation of `
