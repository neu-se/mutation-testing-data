  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.floor() would round the result down to the nearest integer, which would give a different tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil() would round the result up to the nearest integer, which would give a different tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin() would give a different value for the tile coordinate, potentially outside of the range of valid tile coordinates.

DONE.
