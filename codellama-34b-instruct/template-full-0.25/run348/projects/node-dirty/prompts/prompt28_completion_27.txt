  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be different, and the code that handles the `'drain'` event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be different, and the code that handles the `'drain'` event would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be different, and the code that handles the `'drain'` event would not be triggered.

DONE.
