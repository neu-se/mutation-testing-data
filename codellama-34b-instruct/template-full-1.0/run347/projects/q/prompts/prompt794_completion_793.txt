  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so it would cause the `.then` method to skip the callback function and return a fulfilled promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is also a falsy value, so it would have the same effect as using `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that represents an invalid or undefined numeric value, and it is not equal to any other value, including itself. In this case, it would cause the `.then` method to skip the callback function and return a rejected promise with a value of `NaN`.
