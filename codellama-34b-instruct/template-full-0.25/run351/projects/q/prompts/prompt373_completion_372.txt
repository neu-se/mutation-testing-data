  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.onerror` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `exception` object to the `Q.onerror` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(exception, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `exception` object and the `promise` object to the `Q.onerror` function, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
