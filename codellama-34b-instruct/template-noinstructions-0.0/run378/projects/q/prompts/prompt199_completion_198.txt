  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `captureLine` function to always return `undefined`, which would prevent the `qFileName` and `qStartingLine` variables from being set, and the `isInternalFrame` function would always return `false`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return the entire stack trace, even if it contains internal frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `captureLine` function to always return a value, which would set the `qFileName` and `qStartingLine` variables, and the `isInternalFrame` function would always return `true`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to filter out internal frames from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks && !isInternalFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it
