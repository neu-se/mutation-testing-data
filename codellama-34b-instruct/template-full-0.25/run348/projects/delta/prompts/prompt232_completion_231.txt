  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is one character longer than the original code, which could cause the `diffResult.forEach()` loop to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is one character shorter than the original code, which could cause the `diffResult.forEach()` loop to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is twice as long as the original code, which could cause the `diffResult.forEach()` loop to behave differently.

DONE.
