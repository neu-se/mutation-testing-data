  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause the code to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("Custom error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a custom error message, which could cause the code to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a custom error message, which could cause the code to execute differently.

DONE.
