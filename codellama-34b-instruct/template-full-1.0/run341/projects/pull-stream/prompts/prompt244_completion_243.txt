  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code that passes the `abort` error to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_read` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code that passes the `abort` error to the `_read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(read)(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function using the `once` function and the `read` function, and then call that function with `abort` and `cb` as arguments. This is not the same as the original code that directly calls the `read` function with `abort
