  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, b || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are switched, so the result would be different for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(b, a || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are switched, so the result would be different for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is replaced with addition, which would result in a different output value for certain input values.

DONE.
