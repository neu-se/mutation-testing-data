  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Op.length(thisIter.next(1))
This would result in different behavior because using next with a parameter would result in a different array index being used, leading to the mutated operator having a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Op.length(thisIter.next(2))
This would result in different behavior because using next with a parameter would result in an array out of bounds error, mutating the operator to never match the codepath under test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Op.length(otherIter.next())
This would result in different behavior because using next from another iterator would result in a different array index being used, leading to the mutated operator having a different behavior.

DONE.
