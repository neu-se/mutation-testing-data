Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation from `thisIter` is a delete instead of checking if the current operation from `otherIter` is an insert, which would change the logic of how operations are composed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition, causing the code to execute the block when `otherIter` does not have an insert operation, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations during composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are any operations left in `otherIter` instead of checking the type of the next operation, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the nature of the operations being composed.

DONE.
