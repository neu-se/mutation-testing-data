  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(e.stack.lastIndexOf("@") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.substring(e.stack.lastIndexOf("@") + 1)` would return a string that starts at the last occurrence of `@`, whereas `e.stack.split` returns an array of strings split on `@`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.match(/(.+?)@/)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.match(/(.+?)@/)[1]` would return the first group match of the regular expression `/(.+?)@/`, which is different from the behavior of `e.stack.split`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(e.stack.indexOf("@"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.slice(e.stack.indexOf("@"))` would return a
