  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, potentially causing different errors or exceptions to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be synchronously resolved with the results of `inspect()` instead of asynchronously resolved with the results of `all()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.else
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the results of `else` instead of `all()`, potentially causing different errors or exceptions to be thrown.

DONE.
