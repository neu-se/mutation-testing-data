  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being accessed at index 2, which is the third argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being accessed at index 0, which is the first argument passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being accessed at index 3, which is the fourth argument passed to the function.

DONE.
