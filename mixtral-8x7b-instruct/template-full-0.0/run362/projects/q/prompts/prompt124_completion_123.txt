 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the `key` is a property of the `object` without checking its prototype chain, unlike `object_hasOwnProperty` which checks if the `key` is a direct property of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hasOwnProperty` method directly from the `object`, which may not exist if the `object` is not an actual object or if it has been tampered with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.has(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Reflect.has` method, which is a more recent addition to JavaScript and may not be supported in older environments.

DONE.
