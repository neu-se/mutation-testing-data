  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain) {
  domain.exit();
}
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the exception will be thrown after the domain exit, which will potentially affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain) {
  domain.exit();
}
setTimeout(function() { throw e; }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the exception will be thrown after a timeout, which will potentially affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (domain) {
  domain.exit();
}
setImmediate(function() { throw e; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the exception will be thrown after a setImmediate, which will potentially affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
