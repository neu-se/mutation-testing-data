  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the entire string to uppercase, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first character of the string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the string, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
