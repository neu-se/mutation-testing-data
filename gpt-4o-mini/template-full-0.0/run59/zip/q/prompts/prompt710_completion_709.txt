Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the second argument instead of an empty array, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when the `dispatch` method expects an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [1, 2, 3]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a fixed array `[1, 2, 3]` instead of an empty array, which could cause the method to behave incorrectly if it relies on the second argument being an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("getKeys", []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method name from `"keys"` to `"getKeys"`, which likely does not exist, leading to a failure in the dispatch process and potentially causing an error.

DONE.
