  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect["[object Promise]"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would be called with the string `"[object Promise]"` as its argument, which would return `undefined`. This would cause the condition in the `else` block to be evaluated, which returns a promise that is always rejected with the error `new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.apply(this, [op, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would call the `inspect` function with the `this` context set to the current `Promise` object, and an arguments array containing the `op` and `args` parameters. This would allow the `inspect` function to access the current promise object and its properties, which may be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
