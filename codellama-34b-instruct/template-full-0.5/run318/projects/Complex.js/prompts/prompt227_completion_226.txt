  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and `b * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of `b` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and `a - b` is an expression that subtracts the value of `b` from `a`.

DONE.
