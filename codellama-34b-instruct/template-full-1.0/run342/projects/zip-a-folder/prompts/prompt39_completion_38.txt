  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the character 'a' to the end of the `src` string, which would likely cause the archive to be created in a different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `src` string, which would likely cause the archive to be created with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `src` string to uppercase, which would likely cause the archive to be created with a different name.

DONE.
