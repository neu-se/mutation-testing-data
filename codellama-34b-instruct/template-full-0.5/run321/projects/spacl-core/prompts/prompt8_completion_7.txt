  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would return a different result depending on the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a different method than `match`, and it would return a different result depending on the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a different method than `match`, and it would return a different result depending on the input string.

DONE.
