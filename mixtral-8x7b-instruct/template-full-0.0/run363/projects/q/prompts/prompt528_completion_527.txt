 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would not have the correct behavior when the `inspect` method is called, as it would return `undefined` instead of an object with information about the state and value/reason of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would not have the correct behavior when the `inspect` method is called, as it would return an empty object instead of an object with information about the state and value/reason of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would not have the correct behavior when the `inspect` method is called, as it would return a function instead of an object with information about the state and value/reason of the promise.

DONE.
