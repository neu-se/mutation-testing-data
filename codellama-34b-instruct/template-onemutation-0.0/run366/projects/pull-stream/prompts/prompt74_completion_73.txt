  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && true) || true`, which would always be true regardless of the value of `abort`. In contrast, the original code fragment would evaluate to `abort || true`, which would be true if `abort` is truthy and false if it is falsy.
