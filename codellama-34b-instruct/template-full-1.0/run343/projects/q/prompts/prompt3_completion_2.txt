  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a lowercase "promise" string, while the replaced code has a capitalized "Promise" string, which could cause a reference error if the code is not handling the uppercase correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a truthy value, while the replaced code has a falsy value, which could cause the code to take a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a number or a string, while the replaced code has a non-numeric value, which could cause the code to take a different execution path or throw an error.

DONE.
