  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because defer() is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the provided value, whereas <PLACEHOLDER> is a promise that is resolved with the provided value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because resolve() is a function that resolves a promise with the provided value, whereas <PLACEHOLDER> is a promise that is resolved with the provided value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.defer() creates a new deferred object, whereas <PLACEHOLDER> is a promise that is resolved with the provided value.

DONE.
