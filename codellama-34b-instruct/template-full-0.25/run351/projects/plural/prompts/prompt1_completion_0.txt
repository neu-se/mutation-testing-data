  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with different arguments, which would return a different substring of the object's string representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different argument, which would return a different substring of the object's string representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substr(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is called with different arguments, which would return a different substring of the object's string representation.

DONE.
