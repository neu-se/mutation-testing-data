  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would move the iterator to the next operation, whereas `thisIter.rest` would return the remaining operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would move the iterator to the next operation, whereas `thisIter.rest` would return the remaining operations in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Delta()` would create a new, empty delta, whereas `thisIter.rest` would return the remaining operations in the iterator.

DONE.
