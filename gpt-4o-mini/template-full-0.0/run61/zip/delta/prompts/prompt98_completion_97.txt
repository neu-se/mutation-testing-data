Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting `null` into the `ops` array would lead to unexpected behavior when processing the operations, as `null` is not a valid operation and could cause errors in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, { insert: 'default' });
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting a default string operation would change the intended operations, potentially altering the final output of the `Delta` object and affecting how the operations are composed or rendered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, { delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting a delete operation with a length of 1 would modify the state of the `ops` array, leading to a loss of one character or element in the final output, which could change the intended result of the operations.

DONE.
