 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, which is not the same as the original `when` function that handles both resolved and rejected promises. This change would cause the `allResolved` function to immediately resolve, even if some of the input promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (promise) { return promise; }
