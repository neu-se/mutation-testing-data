 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `object_keys` function to include an empty function in the keys array for any object that does not have the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `object_keys` function to throw a `TypeError` when called with an object that does not have the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `object_keys` function to always return an empty array, since the `hasOwnProperty` check would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
