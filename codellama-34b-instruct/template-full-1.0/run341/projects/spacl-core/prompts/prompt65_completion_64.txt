  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `this` context of the callback function, which could potentially cause the function to fail if it relies on the original `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which could cause the `push` method to behave differently if the array is mutated by the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map(rule => [rule])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a nested array of arrays of rules, which could cause the `push` method to behave differently if the callback function expects a flat array of rules.

DONE.
