Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the key has not been seen yet, effectively allowing duplicates instead of filtering them out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key in seen
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key exists in the `seen` object, which could lead to incorrect filtering if the key is present but has a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, meaning that all items would be considered unique regardless of whether they have been seen before.

DONE.
