  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event is emitted when the database is loaded, while the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs. By replacing `load` with `error`, the `Dirty` class will emit an `error` event instead of a `load` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.
