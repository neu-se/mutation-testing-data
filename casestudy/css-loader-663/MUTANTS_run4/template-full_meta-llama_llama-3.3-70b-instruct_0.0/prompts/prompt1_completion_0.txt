Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof url === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the function to return the url immediately if it is a string, rather than if it's not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the url is null, rather than checking its type, which could lead to different handling of null and non-string values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the url is an instance of the String object, rather than just being a string primitive, which could lead to different handling of string objects and primitives.

DONE.
