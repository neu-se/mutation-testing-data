 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is falsy (e.g. `null`, `0`, `''`, or `undefined`), the callback will not be invoked, whereas in the original code, it would still be invoked without any error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb.apply(this)
