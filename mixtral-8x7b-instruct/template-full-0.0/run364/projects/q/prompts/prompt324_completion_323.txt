 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is used to invoke a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object). Using `apply` instead of `call` may cause issues if the `fallback` function expects a specific `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fallback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specified `this` value and partially applied arguments. By using `bind(null)`, we are changing the `this` context of the `fallback` function to `null`, which might not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function() { fallback(); })()
```
This would result in different behavior because we are creating a new function that invokes the `fallback` function when executed. This creates
