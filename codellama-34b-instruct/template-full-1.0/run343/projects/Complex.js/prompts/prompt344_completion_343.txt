  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 2` would add an additional 2 to the value of `b`, which could potentially change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * 2` would multiply the value of `b` by 2, which could potentially change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b / 2` would divide the value of `b` by 2, which could potentially change the result of the function.

DONE.
