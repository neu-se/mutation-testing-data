  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory in the archive, whereas the original code fragment only includes the contents of the `src` directory if the `recursive` option is set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { exclude: ['**/*.js'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude all JavaScript files from the archive, whereas the original code fragment does not exclude any files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { include: ['**/*.js'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include JavaScript files in the archive, whereas the original code fragment includes all files in the `src` directory.

DONE.
