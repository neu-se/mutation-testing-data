  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a path that starts with a slash, while the new code fragment matches a path that starts with a slash and contains at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a path that contains only alphanumeric characters, while the new code fragment matches a path that contains any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a path that contains only alphanumeric characters, while the new code fragment matches a path that contains any character.

DONE.
