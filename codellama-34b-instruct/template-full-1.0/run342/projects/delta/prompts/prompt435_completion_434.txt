  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment uses the greater than or equal to operator, which means that the length can be equal to `opLength - offset`. This modification would exclude that case, potentially leading to different behavior in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset <= opLength - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment uses the greater than operator, which means that the offset can be greater than `opLength - length`. This modification would exclude that case, potentially leading to different behavior in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment uses the greater than operator, which means that the length can be equal to `opLength`. This modification would exclude that case, potentially leading to different behavior in certain situations.

DONE.
