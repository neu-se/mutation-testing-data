  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This change will cause the loop to decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, which will result in the loop running indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This change will cause the loop to increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, which will result in the loop skipping over every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This change will cause the loop to reset the value of `i` to 0 at the end of each iteration, which will result in an infinite loop.

DONE.
