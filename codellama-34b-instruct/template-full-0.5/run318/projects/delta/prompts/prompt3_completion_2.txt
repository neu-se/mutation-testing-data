  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign()` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys, whereas `cloneDeep` returns a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(attributes))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` create a deep copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` uses a different algorithm.

DONE.
