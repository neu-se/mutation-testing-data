  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `null`, whereas the original code would have thrown an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `object`.

DONE.
