  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, while `undefined` is an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, while `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
