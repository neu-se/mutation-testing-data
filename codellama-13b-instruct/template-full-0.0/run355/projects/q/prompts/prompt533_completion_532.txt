  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
