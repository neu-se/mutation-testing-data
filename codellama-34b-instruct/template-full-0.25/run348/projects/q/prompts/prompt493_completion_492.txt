  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the rejected promise, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<resolved>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the resolved promise, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<throw new Error("rejected")>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always throw an error, regardless of the input.

DONE.
