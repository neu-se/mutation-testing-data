  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a different separator, which could cause issues with the error handling and debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with an additional string, which could cause issues with the error handling and debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" + "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be concatenated with a different string, which could cause issues with the error handling and debugging.

DONE.
