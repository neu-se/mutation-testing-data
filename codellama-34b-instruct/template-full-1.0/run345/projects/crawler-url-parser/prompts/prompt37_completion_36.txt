  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement would not be executed, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would throw an error, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing.

DONE.
