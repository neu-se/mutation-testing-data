  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is an alias for `directory` and would zip the files directly, while the original code would zip the directory as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(src, {cwd: src, nodir: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would glob the src directory and exclude any directory entries, which would result in a different archive structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false, {date: new Date('2000-01-01')})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the directory date to a fixed value, which would change the archive contents.

DONE.
