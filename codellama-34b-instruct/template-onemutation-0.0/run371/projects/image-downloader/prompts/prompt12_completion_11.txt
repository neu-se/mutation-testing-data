  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` is a string, while `pathname.split('/').pop()` is an array. The `decodeURIComponent` function expects a string as input, so passing an array would cause an error.
