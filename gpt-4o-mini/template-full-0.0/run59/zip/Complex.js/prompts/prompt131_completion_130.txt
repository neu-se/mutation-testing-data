Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of operations involving infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass when the number is not infinite, potentially allowing operations that should return NaN to proceed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional condition that checks if the second complex number is not infinite, which could lead to incorrect results when both numbers are infinite, as it would not return NaN in that case.

DONE.
