  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a callback function, while the new code fragment is an empty function that does not reference any callback function. This could cause issues if the original code fragment was relying on the callback function to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a callback function, while the new code fragment is a null value. This could cause issues if the original code fragment was relying on the callback function to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a callback function, while the new code fragment is an undefined value. This could cause issues if the original code fragment was relying on the callback function to be executed.

DONE.
