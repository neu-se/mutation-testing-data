  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove any characters after a `#` symbol in the `baseUrlStr`, while this new code fragment would remove any characters after a `$` symbol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove any characters after a `#` symbol in the `baseUrlStr`, while this new code fragment would remove any characters after a `$` symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove any leading `//` characters in the `baseUrlStr`, while this new code fragment would remove any leading `/` characters.
