  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the archive has been finalized and the output stream has been closed. In contrast, the new code fragment listens for the 'error' event, which is emitted when an error occurs while creating the archive. If an error occurs, the promise will be rejected, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the archive has been finalized and the output stream has been closed. In contrast, the new code fragment listens for the 'finish' event, which is emitted when the archive has been finalized but the output stream has not been closed. If the output stream is not closed, the program may behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
