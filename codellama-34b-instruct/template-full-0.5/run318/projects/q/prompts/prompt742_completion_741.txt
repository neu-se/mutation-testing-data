  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(undefined, onRejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` would be called twice if the promise is rejected, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(undefined, onRejected).then(undefined, onFulfilled);
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` would be called twice if the promise is fulfilled, which is not the intended behavior.
