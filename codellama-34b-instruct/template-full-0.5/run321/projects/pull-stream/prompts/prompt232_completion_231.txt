  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy and `test(data)` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is truthy. If `end` is truthy, the new code fragment will always return `true`, regardless of the value of `test(data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy and `test(data)` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is falsy or `test(data)` is truthy. If `end` is falsy, the new code fragment will always return `true`, regardless of the value of `test(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !test(data)
