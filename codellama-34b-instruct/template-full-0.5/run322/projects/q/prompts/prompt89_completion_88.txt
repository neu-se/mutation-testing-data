  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a local variable that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function, while `arguments[0]` is the first argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` is the second argument passed to the function, while `arguments` is a local variable that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length` is the number of arguments passed to the function, while `arguments` is a local variable that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
