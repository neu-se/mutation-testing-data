  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the "file:" protocol would cause the regular expression to match URLs that contain the "file:" protocol, which would not have been matched by the original regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|data:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the "data:" protocol would cause the regular expression to match URLs that contain the "data:" protocol, which would not have been matched by the original regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|about:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the "about:" protocol would cause the regular expression to match URLs that contain the "about:" protocol, which would not have been matched by the original regular expression.
