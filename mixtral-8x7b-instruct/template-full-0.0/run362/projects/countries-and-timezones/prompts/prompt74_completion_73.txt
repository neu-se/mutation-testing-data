 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<name>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string `'<name>'` instead of the actual `name` variable, which may cause issues when comparing or using the timezone name in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `name` variable with a hardcoded integer value, causing unexpected results when comparing or using the timezone name in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `name` variable with a random number, causing unexpected results when comparing or using the timezone name in other parts of the code.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process can help developers identify potential weaknesses in the test suite and improve the overall test coverage. DONE.
