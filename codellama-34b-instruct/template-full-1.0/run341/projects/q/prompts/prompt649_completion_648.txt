  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the position of `name` and `args`, which would cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name.toUpperCase(), args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `name` variable to uppercase, which would cause the method to be called with a different name, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name.slice(1), args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `name` variable, which would cause the method to be called with a different name, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
