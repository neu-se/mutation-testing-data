Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link && flagsNum & O_RDONLY
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a link and the `O_RDONLY` flag instead of `O_EXCL`, which is used for exclusive creation, potentially allowing files to be overwritten.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!link || flagsNum & O_EXCL
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the link does not exist or when the `O_EXCL` flag is set, unlike the original code which only throws an error when the link exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link && !(flagsNum & O_EXCL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the link exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is not set, which is the opposite behavior of the original code.

DONE.
