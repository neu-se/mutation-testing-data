  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return an empty string, which would cause the `retain` property of the returned object to be set to 0, instead of the intended length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a string that is one character shorter than the original string, which would cause the `retain` property of the returned object to be set to the length of the string minus one, instead of the intended length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a string that is one character longer than the original string, which would cause the `retain` property of the returned object to be set to the length of the string plus one, instead of the intended length of the string.

DONE.
