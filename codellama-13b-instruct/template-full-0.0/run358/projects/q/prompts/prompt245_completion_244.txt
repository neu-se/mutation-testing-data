  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    if (!resolvedPromise) {
        return { state: "pending" };
    }
    return resolvedPromise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return a different value when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    if (!resolvedPromise) {
        return { state: "pending" };
    }
    return resolvedPromise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return a different value when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect = function () {
    if (!resolvedPromise) {
        return { state: "pending" };
