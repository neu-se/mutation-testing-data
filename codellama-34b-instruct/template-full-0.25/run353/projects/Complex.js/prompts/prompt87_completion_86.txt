  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks whether a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks whether a value is not not a number, which is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/0
```
This would result in different behavior because `1/0` is an expression that results in a division by zero error, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
