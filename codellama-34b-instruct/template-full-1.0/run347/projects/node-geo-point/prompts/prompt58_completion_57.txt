  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different signatures. `sin(x)` returns the sine of the angle `x` in radians, while `cos(x)` returns the cosine of the angle `x` in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which is not inverse to `sin` or `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which is not inverse to `sin` or `cos`.

DONE.
