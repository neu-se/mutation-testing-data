 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects the third argument to be a function, and `null` is not a function. This would likely cause an exception to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not call the `progressed` function with the arguments passed to `deferred.notify`. This would mean that progress notifications would not be handled correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a strict mode directive in the middle of a non-strict function would cause a `SyntaxError` to be thrown.

DONE.
