  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var animals = ['bison', 'cod', 'deer', 'fowl', 'halibut', 'moose', 'sheep'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regex to match the words, while this code uses a simple array to match the words. This will cause the mutation testing to report a failure if any of the animals in the `plural` function are not present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var animals = ['goat', 'cat', 'dog', 'fox', 'rabbit', 'bear'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regex to match the words, while this code uses a simple array to match the words. This will cause the mutation testing to report a failure if any of the animals in the `plural` function are present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
