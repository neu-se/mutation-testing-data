  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "/" character to split the string, while the new code fragment uses the "\" character, which would result in a different array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "/" character to split the string, while the new code fragment uses the "/" character, which would result in the same array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "/" character to split the string, while the new code fragment uses the "\" character, which would result in a different array of strings.

DONE.
