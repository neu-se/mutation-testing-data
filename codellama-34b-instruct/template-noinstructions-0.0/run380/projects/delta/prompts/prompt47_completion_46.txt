  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as the `a` variable is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as the `b` variable is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as the `c` variable is not defined.

DONE.
