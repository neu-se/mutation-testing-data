  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `length` and `index` values before subtracting `offset`, which could result in a different final value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `offset` from `index` before adding `length`, which could result in a different final value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `index` from `offset` before adding `length`, which could result in a different final value.

DONE.
