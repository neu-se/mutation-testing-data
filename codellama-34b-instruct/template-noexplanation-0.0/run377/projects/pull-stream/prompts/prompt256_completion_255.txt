  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to always assign the current stream to the `_read` variable, even if it is not a valid stream. This will cause the `nextChunk` function to try to read from the `_read` variable, which will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to always assign `null` to the `_read` variable, even if it is a valid stream. This will cause the `nextChunk` function to try to read from the `_read` variable, which will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.pipe(values)
```
This change will cause the `nextStream` function to assign the result of piping the current stream through the `values` function to the `_read` variable. This will cause the `nextChunk` function to try to
