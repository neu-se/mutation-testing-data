  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver([deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `deferred` object's properties as arguments to the `resolver` function, which could potentially create conflicts or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolver` function with the `deferred` object's properties as arguments, which could potentially cause a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver(undefined, deferred.reject, deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolver` function with `undefined` as the first argument, which could potentially cause a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
