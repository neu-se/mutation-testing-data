  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not` is a different function than `tester`, and it may not have the same behavior or output as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(test)` is a different function call than `tester(test)`, and it may not have the same behavior or output as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(test, true)` is a different function call than `tester(test)`, and it may not have the same behavior or output as the original code.

DONE.
