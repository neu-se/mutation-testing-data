  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will always return `true` if the first operand is truthy, regardless of the value of `abort`. This means that the `abortCb` function will never be called, and the `cb` function will always be called with the value `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will always return `false` if the first operand is falsy, regardless of the value of `abort`. This means that the `abortCb` function will always be called, and the `cb` function will never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator will return `true` if `abort` is truthy, and `false` otherwise. This means that the
