  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const line = new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object called `line`, which would not be used anywhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const line = new Delta(this.ops.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object called `line` and initialize it with a slice of the `this.ops` array, which would not be used anywhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const line = new Delta(this.ops.slice(0, 10));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object called `line` and initialize it with a slice of the `this.ops` array, but only the first 10 elements would be included. This would cause the code to behave differently when the `eachLine` method is called.
