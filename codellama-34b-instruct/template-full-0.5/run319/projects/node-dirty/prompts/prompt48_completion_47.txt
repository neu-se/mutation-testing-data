  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called, which may cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a null value, which may cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a function that does nothing, which may cause the test to fail.

DONE.
