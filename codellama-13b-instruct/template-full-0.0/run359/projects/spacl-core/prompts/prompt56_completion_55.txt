  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/([.$])/g` matches any character that is either a dot, dollar sign, or period, and the `replace` method replaces each match with the string `\$1`, which is the first captured group in the regular expression. In the original code, the regular expression matches any character that is either a dot, dollar sign, or period, and the `replace` method replaces each match with the string `$1`, which is the first captured group in the regular expression. The difference in behavior is that the original code replaces each match with the string `$1`, which is the first captured group in the regular expression, while the modified code replaces each match with the string `\$1`, which is the first captured group in the regular expression, with the backslash escaped.
