  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is used to wait for all promises to resolve before returning the result, whereas the original code fragment uses the `spread` function to wait for all promises to resolve and then return the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function is used to wait for any promise to resolve before returning the result, whereas the original code fragment uses the `spread` function to wait for all promises to resolve and then return the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because the `none` function is used to wait for all promises to reject before returning the result, whereas the original code fragment uses the `spread` function to wait for all promises to resolve and then return the result.

DONE.
