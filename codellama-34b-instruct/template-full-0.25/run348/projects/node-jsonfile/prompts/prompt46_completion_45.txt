  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFileSync` method on the `fs` module, which is not the same as the original code fragment `fs.writeFileSync`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFile` method on the `fs` module, which is not the same as the original code fragment `fs.writeFileSync`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFileSync` method on the `fs` module with a different set of options, which could potentially result in different behavior.

DONE.
