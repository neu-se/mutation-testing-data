  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` check is missing, which would cause the code to throw an error if `promise` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled" && promise.inspect().value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where the promise is fulfilled with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
