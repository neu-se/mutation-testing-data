  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/[^/]+')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra segment to the path, which would not be present in the original path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/[^/]+/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra slash to the end of the path, which would not be present in the original path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/[^/]+/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra slash to the end of the path, which would not be present in the original path.

DONE.
