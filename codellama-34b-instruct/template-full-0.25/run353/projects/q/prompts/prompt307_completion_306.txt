  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not being called with the correct arguments. The `resolve` and `reject` functions are not defined in the context of the `race` function, and therefore the promise would not be resolved or rejected as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function(value) {
    resolve(value);
}, function(reason) {
    reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not being called with the correct arguments. The `resolve` and `reject` functions are not defined in the context of the `race` function, and therefore the promise would not be resolved or rejected as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function(value) {
    return value;
