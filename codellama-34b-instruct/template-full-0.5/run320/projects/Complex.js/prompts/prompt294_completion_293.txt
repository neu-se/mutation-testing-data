  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * b` expression would have a different value than the original `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would have a different value than the original `b` variable.

DONE.
