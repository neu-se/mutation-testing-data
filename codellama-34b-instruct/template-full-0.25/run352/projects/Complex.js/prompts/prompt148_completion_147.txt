  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
