  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function stupidSwap(a, b) {
  return [b, a];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because this function always returns an array of the same two elements, regardless of their order, whereas the original replacer function uses the JavaScript array `sort()` method to reorder the elements based on their natural order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function stupidReplacer(key, value) {
  return value + '_stupid';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because this function always returns a string that ends with '_stupid', whereas the original replacer function returned a value based on the input `key` and `value` parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function brokenReplacer(key, value) {
  if (value == null) {
    throw new Error('Invalid value');
  }
  return value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because this
