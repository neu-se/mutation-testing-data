  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any options to the `buildCountry` function, while this modified code fragment passes an empty object as options. This could potentially change the behavior of the `buildCountry` function, depending on how it handles options.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any options to the `buildCountry` function, while this modified code fragment passes an object with a `deprecated` property set to `true`. This could potentially change the behavior of the `buildCountry` function, depending on how it handles deprecated countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed two arguments to the `buildCountry` function (the `data` object and the `
