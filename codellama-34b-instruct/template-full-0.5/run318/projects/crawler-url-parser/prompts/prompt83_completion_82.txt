  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "href" attribute of the current element, rather than the value of the "href" attribute of the element with the specified selector.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "href" attribute of the first "a" element that is a descendant of the current element, rather than the value of the "href" attribute of the element with the specified selector.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).closest('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "href" attribute of the closest ancestor element that is an "a" element, rather than the value of the "href" attribute of the element with the specified selector.

DONE.
