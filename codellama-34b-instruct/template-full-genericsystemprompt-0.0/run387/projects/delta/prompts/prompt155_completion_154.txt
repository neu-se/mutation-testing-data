  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` is a property that returns an iterator object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next element, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` simply checks if there is a next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next element without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` simply checks if there is a next element.

DONE.
