  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is used for the calculation of `sinφ2`, while `longitude` is used in the calculation of `λ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is used for the calculation of `sinφ2`, while `latitude + 1` is used in the calculation of `λ2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is used for the calculation of `sinφ2`, while `longitude + 1` is used in the calculation of `λ2`.

DONE.
