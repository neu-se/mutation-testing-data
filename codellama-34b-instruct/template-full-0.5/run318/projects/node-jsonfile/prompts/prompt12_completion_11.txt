  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause an error when `JSON.parse` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would cause an error when `JSON.parse` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : 'reviver'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'reviver'` is a string, and would cause an error when `JSON.parse` is called.

DONE.
