  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the `Math.abs()` function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `b` by 2 would change the result of the `Math.abs()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `a` and `b` together would change the result of the `Math.abs()` function.

DONE.
