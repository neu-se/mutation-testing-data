Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first argument instead of all arguments, potentially leading to incorrect function calls when multiple arguments are expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the first argument instead of creating an array of all arguments, which would cause the function to fail if more than one argument is passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected arguments with an empty array, causing the function to be called without any arguments, which may lead to unexpected results or errors in the dispatched method.

DONE.
