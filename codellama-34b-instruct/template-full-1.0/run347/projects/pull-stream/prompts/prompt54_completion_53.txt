  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink = read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `read` function to the `sink` property of the object `s`, rather than calling the `sink` function with the `read` function as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function with the `read` function as an argument, rather than assigning the `read` function to the `sink` property of the object `s`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the value of the `sink` property of the object `s`, rather than calling the `sink` function with the `read` function as an argument.

DONE.
