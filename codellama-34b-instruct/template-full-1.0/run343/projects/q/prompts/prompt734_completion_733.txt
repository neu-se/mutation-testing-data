  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).map(function(p) { return p.inspect(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return an array of inspection objects, rather than an array of values, which is what the original code returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).map(function(p) { return p.isFulfilled && p.value(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return an array of boolean values indicating whether each promise is fulfilled and has a value, rather than an array of values like the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).filter(function(p) { return p.isFulfilled; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method would return an array of only the fulfilled promises, rather than an array of all promises and their inspection objects.
