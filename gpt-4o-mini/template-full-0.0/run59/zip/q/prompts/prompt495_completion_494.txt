Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add the promise to the `unhandledRejections` array again, potentially leading to duplicate entries and incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable tracking of unhandled rejections immediately upon rejection, preventing any further handling or reporting of that rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push("Unhandled rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a generic message to the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the actual reason for the rejection, leading to a loss of important debugging information.

DONE.
