  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('Load error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom message instead of the expected 'load' event with the number of items loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event with a negative number of items loaded, which is unexpected and could cause errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load' event with an incorrect number of items loaded, which could cause errors in the application.

DONE.
