  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e$/` would not match the word "fe" at the end of the word, resulting in the incorrect plural form "fes" instead of "ves".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e$/` would not match the word "fe" at the end of the word, resulting in the incorrect plural form "fes" instead of "ves".
