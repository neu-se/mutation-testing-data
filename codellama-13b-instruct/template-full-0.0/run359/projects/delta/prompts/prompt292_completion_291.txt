  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index > 0` check would allow the `eachLine` method to iterate over the first line of the delta, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index > 1` check would skip the first line of the delta, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index === 0` check would only iterate over the first line of the delta, which is not intended.

DONE.
