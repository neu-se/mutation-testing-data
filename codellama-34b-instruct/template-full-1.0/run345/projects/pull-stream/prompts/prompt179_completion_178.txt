  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Sometimes I will write first drafts and edit them a lot. I feel like writing in a drafting/outlining style can help me come up with the appropriate places for tests, and then I can fill them in with more detailed, descriptive tests later on. This approach works for me because it helps me think through the logic of the module, and it gives me a starting point for my tests.
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of `cb` from always being called to only being called sometimes. This would make the function more buggy and harder to test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of arguments passed to `abortCb` from 3 to 2. This would likely cause the function to crash or behave incorrectly when it is called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
