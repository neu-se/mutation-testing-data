  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `untrackRejection` function call with itself, which would not change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `untrackRejection` function call with the `trackRejection` function call, which would cause the rejection to be tracked instead of untracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `untrackRejection` function call with a direct push of the reason to the `unhandledRejections` array, bypassing the `trackRejection` function entirely.

DONE.
