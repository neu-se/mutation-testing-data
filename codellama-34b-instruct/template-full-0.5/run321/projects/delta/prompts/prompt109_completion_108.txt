  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now negated, causing the filter function to return the opposite of what it would have returned with the original predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now checking if the op has attributes, which would cause the filter function to return a different set of ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now checking if the op has an insert operation, which would cause the filter function to return a different set of ops.

DONE.
