  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different object, since the `true` value means that the URL parser should parse the input as a URL, but the `false` value means that it should parse the input as a file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would throw a `URIError` exception, since the `invalid` value is not a valid argument for the `URL.parse` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different object, since the `2` value means that the URL parser should parse the input as a file path, but the `true` value means that it should parse the input as a URL.

DONE.
