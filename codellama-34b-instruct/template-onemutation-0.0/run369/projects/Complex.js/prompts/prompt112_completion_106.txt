  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sign` method to always return a complex number with a real part equal to the absolute value of the original complex number, and an imaginary part equal to zero, regardless of the original complex number's imaginary part.

DONE.
