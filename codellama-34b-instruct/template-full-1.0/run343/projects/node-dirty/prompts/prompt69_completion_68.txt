  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this, 'load', 0)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` would be invoked immediately rather than being passed as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(this.emit.bind(this, 'load', 0))
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` would be used instead of `process.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this, 'load', 1)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value `1` would be passed as the second argument to `emit` instead of `0`.

DONE.
