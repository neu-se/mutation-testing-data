  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream for the `dest` file, rather than piping the response data to the existing write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the response data to the existing `dest` file, rather than overwriting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `dest` file, rather than appending to it.

DONE.
