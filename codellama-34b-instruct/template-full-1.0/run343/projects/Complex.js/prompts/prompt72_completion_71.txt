  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tokens === null` checks if the variable `tokens` is null, but this replacement would assign the value of `tokens` to the variable `tokens`, which would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tokens === null` checks if the variable `tokens` is not null, but this replacement would check if the variable `tokens` is null, which would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `tokens === null` checks if the variable `tokens` is null, but this replacement would check if the first element of the array `tokens` is null.

DONE.
