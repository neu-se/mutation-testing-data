  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, which could cause an error if the array is not large enough to accommodate the extra iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original code, which could cause the loop to skip the last element in the array.

DONE.
