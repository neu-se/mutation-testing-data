  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is an event that is emitted when the stream has finished reading from its file descriptor, whereas `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs during reading. Replacing `'error'` with `'end'` would change the behavior of the code so that it no longer handles errors correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'drain'` is an event that is emitted when the stream can accept more data to write, whereas `'error'` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs during reading. Replacing `'error'` with `'drain'` would change the behavior of the code so that it no longer handles errors correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'read_close'` is an event that is emitted when the read stream is
