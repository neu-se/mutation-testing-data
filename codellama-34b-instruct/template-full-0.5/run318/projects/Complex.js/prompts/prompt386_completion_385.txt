  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` uses the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the replacement code fragment `2 * a` uses the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` uses only the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the replacement code fragment `2 * (a + b)` uses both the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * b` uses only the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the replacement code fragment `2 * (a - b)` uses both the real and imaginary parts, but in a different way.

DONE.
