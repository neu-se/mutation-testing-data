  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still reject the promise even if the `options.dest` property is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is not a valid URL')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still reject the promise even if the `options.url` property is a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a valid path')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still reject the promise even if the `options.dest` property is a valid path.

DONE.
