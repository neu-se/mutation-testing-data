  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key from the map, whereas the original code fragment `this._data.set(key, val)` would set the value for the key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value for the key to `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment `this._data.set(key, val)` would set the value for the key to the value of the `val` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value for the key to `val + 1`, whereas the original code fragment `this._data.set(key, val)` would set the value for the
