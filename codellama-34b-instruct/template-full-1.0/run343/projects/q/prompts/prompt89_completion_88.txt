  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now being passed as the second argument to `call()`, instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is now being passed as the second argument to `call()`, instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the `arguments` object is now being passed as the second argument to `call()`, instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
