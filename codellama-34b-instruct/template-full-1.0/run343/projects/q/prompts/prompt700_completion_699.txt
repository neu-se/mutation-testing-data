  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + [void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args.concat` would concatenate the `args` array with the resolved value of the promise, while the modified code fragment `args + [void 0]` would concatenate the `args` array with an array containing `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat.apply(args, [void 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args.concat` would concatenate the `args` array with the resolved value of the promise, while the modified code fragment `[].concat.apply(args, [void 0])` would concatenate the `args` array with an empty array, then apply the `concat` method to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args.concat` would
