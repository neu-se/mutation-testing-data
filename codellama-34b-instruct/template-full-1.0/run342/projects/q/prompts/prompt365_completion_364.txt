  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` function to be called, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `done`, which could cause the `deferred.resolve` method to be called with a different value than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` variable to be undefined, which could cause the `deferred.resolve` method to be called with a different value than intended.

DONE.
