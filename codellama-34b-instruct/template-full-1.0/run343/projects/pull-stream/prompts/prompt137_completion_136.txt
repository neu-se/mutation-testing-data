  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return one less value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return one more value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the opposite of the expected value (true instead of false), potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
