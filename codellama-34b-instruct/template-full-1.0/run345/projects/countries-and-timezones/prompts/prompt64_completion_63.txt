  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(countries, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverCountry` is a function that takes two arguments, but in this case, only one argument is provided, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(timezones, options);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverCountry` is a function that takes two arguments, but in this case, the first argument is a different object than the one that was originally passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry(countries, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverCountry` is a function that takes two arguments, but in this case, the second argument is an object with a different value for the `deprecated` property.

DONE.
