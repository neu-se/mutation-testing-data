  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially skipping over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over every other element in the array, potentially missing certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to start at the last element of the array instead of the first, potentially reversing the order of the elements.

DONE.
