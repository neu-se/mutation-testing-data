  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` operator would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `promise`, causing the loop to never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would be assigned to `p` instead of `p.source`, causing the loop to execute with the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would be assigned to `p` instead of `p.source`, causing the loop to execute with the wrong value.

DONE.
