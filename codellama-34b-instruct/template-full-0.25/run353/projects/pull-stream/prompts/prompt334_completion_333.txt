  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `end` as an argument when `end` is truthy, whereas this modified code fragment calls `cb` with both `end` and `data` as arguments regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `end` as an argument when `end` is falsy, whereas this modified code fragment calls `cb` with both `end` and `data` as arguments regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? cb(end, data) : cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `end` as an argument when `end` is truthy, whereas
