  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the given number of characters from the string, whereas `push` is a method that adds elements to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element from an array, whereas `push` is a method that adds elements to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes the first element from an array, whereas `push` is a method that adds elements to the end of an array.

DONE.
