  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the product of `a` and `b` to `c` instead of multiplying them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (b + c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `b` and `c` and then multiply the result by `a` instead of multiplying `a` and `b` and then adding `c`.

DONE.
