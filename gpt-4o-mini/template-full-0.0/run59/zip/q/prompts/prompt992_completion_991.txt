Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore all additional arguments passed to the function, potentially leading to unexpected results when the function is called with more than one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first additional argument passed to the function, which may not be sufficient for the intended operation, especially if multiple arguments are expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access an index that is out of bounds if fewer than four arguments are provided, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the function is invoked with fewer arguments.

DONE.
