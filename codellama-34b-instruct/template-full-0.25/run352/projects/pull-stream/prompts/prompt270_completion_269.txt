  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && stream.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stream has a length greater than 0, rather than checking if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && stream.constructor === Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stream is an array, rather than checking if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && stream.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stream is an object, rather than checking if it is an array.

DONE.
