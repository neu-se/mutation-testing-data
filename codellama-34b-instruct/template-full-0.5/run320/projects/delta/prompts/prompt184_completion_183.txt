  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be treated as an object, rather than a number, which could lead to unexpected results when comparing the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be treated as a function, rather than a number, which could lead to unexpected results when trying to call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be treated as undefined, rather than a number, which could lead to unexpected results when trying to use the value of the property.

DONE.
