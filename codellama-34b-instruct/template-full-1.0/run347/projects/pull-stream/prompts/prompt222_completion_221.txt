  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the `end` value to be `null` before calling the callback, while the new code always calls the callback with `abort` and `data` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the `end` value to be `null` before calling the callback, while the new code always calls the callback with a `null` `end` value and an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the `end` value to be `null` before calling the callback, while the new code always calls the callback with `undefined` values.

DONE.
