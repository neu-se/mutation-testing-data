  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL components without the query string and without the hash fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL components with the query string but without the hash fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL components with the hash fragment but without the query string.

DONE.
