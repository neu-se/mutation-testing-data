  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the queue for the given key to the callback function, whereas the original code sets the queue to a list containing the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [cb]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the queue for the given key to a list containing the callback function, whereas the original code sets the queue to the callback function directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.push(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the key to the queue, whereas the original code sets the queue for the given key to the callback function.
```
DONE.
