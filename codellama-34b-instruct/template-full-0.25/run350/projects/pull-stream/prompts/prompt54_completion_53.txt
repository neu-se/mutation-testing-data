  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source` is a function that returns a new source, whereas `s.sink` is a function that returns a new sink.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source(read)` is a function that returns a new source, whereas `s.sink` is a function that returns a new sink.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink(read)` is a function that returns a new sink, whereas `s.source` is a function that returns a new source.

DONE.
