 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof process !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, bypassing the check for a real Node environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns false, preventing the code from executing in a Node.js environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window !== "undefined" && window.process && process.toString() === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a global `window` object with a `process` property, which may not be present in a non-browser environment.

DONE.
