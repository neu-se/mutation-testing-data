Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the query function to be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the query function to be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.
