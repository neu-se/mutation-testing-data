  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is replaced with `-`, which would cause the calculation of the square root to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is replaced with `*`, which would cause the calculation of the square root to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is replaced with `/`, which would cause the calculation of the square root to be incorrect.

DONE.
