 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
cheerio.load('<html><body><a href="test"></a></body></html>')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new anchor tag with a "test" href, which might not be expected in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cheerio.load('<html><body><a href="https://example.com"></a></body></html>', {
  decodeEntities: false
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables entity decoding, which might affect the parsing of the HTML content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cheerio.load('<html><body><a href="//example.com"></a></body></html>')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a relative URL without a protocol, which might not be handled correctly by the `parse` function.

DONE.
