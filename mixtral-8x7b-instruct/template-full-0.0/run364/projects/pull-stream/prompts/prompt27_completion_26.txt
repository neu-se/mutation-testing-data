 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is a constant value, whereas the original code fragment is a variable that can hold different values in different contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is a random value, whereas the original code fragment is a variable that can hold different values in different contexts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is the loop variable, whereas the original code fragment is a variable that can hold different values in different contexts.

DONE.
