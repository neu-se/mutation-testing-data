  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set` would always set a value for the given key, whereas `this.get` would only return a value if the key exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` would always return `true` if the key exists, regardless of the value associated with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.size` would always return the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas `this.get` would only return a value if the key exists.

DONE.
