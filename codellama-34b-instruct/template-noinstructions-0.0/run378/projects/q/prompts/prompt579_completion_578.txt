  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is not being called with the correct `this` context, which is the `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called with `null` as the `this` context, which is not the same as the original code where `continuer` is being used as the `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called with `undefined` as the `this` context, which is not the same as the original code where `continuer` is being used as the `this` context.

DONE.
