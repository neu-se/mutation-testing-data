  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function, and calling it would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.call` is a function, and calling it would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.bind` is a function, and calling it would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
