  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() && z.isInfinite()
```
This would cause the NaN result for `Complex.INFINITY / Complex.INFINITY` to be returned instead of NaN, which is incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite()
```
This would cause `Complex.INFINITY / Complex.INFINITY` to return `Complex.INFINITY` incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isZero() && z.isZero()
```
This would cause the NaN result for `Complex.ZERO / Complex.ZERO` to be returned instead of `Complex.ONE`, which is incorrect behavior.

DONE.
