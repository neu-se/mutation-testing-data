  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1` takes a single argument, and `a` is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts, so the result would be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` takes a single argument, and `a` is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts, so the result would be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a.re)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.re` is the real part of the complex number `a`, so the result would be different from the original code, which uses the entire complex number `a`.

DONE.
