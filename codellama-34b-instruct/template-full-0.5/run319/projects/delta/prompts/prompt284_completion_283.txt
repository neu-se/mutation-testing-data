  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a tab character instead of a newline, which would change the formatting of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an empty string instead of a newline, which would not create a new line break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a space character instead of a newline, which would change the formatting of the text.

DONE.
