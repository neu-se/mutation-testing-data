  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, meaning that the code would only execute if the values are equal, rather than if they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the attribute is undefined, rather than checking if it is not equal to the value of the base attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the attribute is undefined, rather than checking if it is not equal to the value of the base attribute. Additionally, it would only execute the code if the values are not equal, rather than if they are equal.

DONE.
