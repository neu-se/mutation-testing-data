  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove the last part of the path, while this code fragment uses a regular expression to remove the last part of the path, which could result in different behavior if the path contains multiple slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the path into an array of parts, while this code fragment uses the `pop` method to remove the last part of the path, which could result in different behavior if the path contains multiple slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.match(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
