 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the type check for the `test` variable would always return false, causing the `last` variable to be set to true and a new `test` function to be created, which always returns -1. This would lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if `test` is a function, allowing any value to be passed as `test`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific constructor. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `test` variable is not an instance of the Function constructor, but still behaves like a function.
