  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially leading to an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
