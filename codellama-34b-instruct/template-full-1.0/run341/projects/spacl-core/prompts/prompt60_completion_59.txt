  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is now being called with an argument, which would cause it to return a different regular expression pattern, potentially leading to false positives or false negatives in the test results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is no longer being called, and instead the regular expression pattern is being built directly from the `parts` array, without applying the final transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is no longer being called, and instead the regular expression pattern is being built directly from the `parts` array, with a different final transformation (joining the segments without the leading slash).

DONE.
