  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the promise returned by `fail` always fulfilled, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () {}, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the promise returned by `fail` always rejected, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(noop, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the promise returned by `fail` never be resolved, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
