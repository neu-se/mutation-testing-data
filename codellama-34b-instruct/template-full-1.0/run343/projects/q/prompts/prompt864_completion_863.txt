  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is being used as a function in the original code, and calling it with `null` would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `Q` as a string instead of a function, and would not call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is being used as a function in the original code, and calling it with `undefined` would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
