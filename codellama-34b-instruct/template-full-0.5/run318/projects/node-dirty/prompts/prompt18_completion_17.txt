  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callbacks would be called in reverse order, which could cause unexpected behavior if the callbacks are dependent on each other.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be removed from the list, which could cause the callback to not be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be removed from the beginning of the list, which could cause the callback to not be called at all.

DONE.
