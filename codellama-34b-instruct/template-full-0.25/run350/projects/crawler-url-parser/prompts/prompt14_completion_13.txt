  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "https://" to the URL, even if it already has a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http://" or "https://" protocol from the URL, even if it is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend "ftp://" to the URL, even if it already has a protocol.

DONE.
