 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, which may not be the same as the original `this` value in the context where the mutated code is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with the provided `this` value and arguments, which may not be the same as the original `this` value and arguments in the context where the mutated code is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.apply(window)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the function with the provided `this` value and an array of arguments, which may not be the same as the original `this` value and arguments in the context where the mutated code
