  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the argument is not an array. This change would cause the function to return a different result for arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks if the array has a length of 0, while `!array.length` checks if the array has a length of 1 or more. This change would cause the function to return a different result for empty arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof array` checks if the argument is an object, while `!typeof array` checks if the argument is not an object. This change would cause the function to return a different result for non-object arguments.
