  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete` would delete the entire line, whereas `line.push` would push the current line onto the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the entire `delta` array, whereas `line.push` would push the current line onto the `delta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.delete` would delete the entire `other` array, whereas `line.push` would push the current line onto the `delta` array.

DONE.
