  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(field !== field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is different from the original `==` operator, and it would always return `true` when the `field` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
( field + 1 )
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the `field`, and it would affect the behavior of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
( field * 0 )
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 0` would always return `0`, and it would affect the behavior of the `unique` function.

DONE.
