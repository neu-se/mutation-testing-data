  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different function than `fulfill`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(otherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `fulfill`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the one that was passed to `fulfill`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(otherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different function than `reject`, and it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the one that was passed to `reject`.

DONE.
