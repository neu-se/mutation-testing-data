  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(callback).nfapply(args)` would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, as `Q(null).nfapply(args)` is equivalent to `Q.reject(null).nfapply(args)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(callback).nfapply(args)` would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, as `Q(undefined).nfapply(args)` is equivalent to `Q.reject(undefined).nfapply(args)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(callback).nfapply(args)` would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, as `Q(0).nfapply(args)` is equivalent to `Q.reject(0).nfapply(args)`.

DONE.
