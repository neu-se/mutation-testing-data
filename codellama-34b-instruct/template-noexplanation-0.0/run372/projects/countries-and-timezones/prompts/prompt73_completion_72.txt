  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive a `null` value as its first argument, which may cause the function to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive an `undefined` value as its first argument, which may cause the function to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive an empty object as its first argument, which may cause the function to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

DONE.
