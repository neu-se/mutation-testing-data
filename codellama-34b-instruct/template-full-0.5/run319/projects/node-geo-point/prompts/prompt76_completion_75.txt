  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor()` function would round the value of `θ` down to the nearest integer, which could result in a different bearing being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number()` function would convert the value of `θ` to a number, but it would not round it down to the nearest integer like `Math.floor()` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil()` function would round the value of `θ` up to the nearest integer, which could also result in a different bearing being calculated.

DONE.
