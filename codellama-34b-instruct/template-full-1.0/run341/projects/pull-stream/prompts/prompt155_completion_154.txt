  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is being called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is being called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function is being called instead of the original `onAbort` function.

DONE.
