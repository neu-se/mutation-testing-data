  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to always return the original string, without applying any pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { return this.toUpperCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to always return the uppercase version of the original string, without applying any pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { return this.split('').reverse().join(''); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `plural` function to always return the reversed version of the original string, without applying any pluralization rules.

DONE.
