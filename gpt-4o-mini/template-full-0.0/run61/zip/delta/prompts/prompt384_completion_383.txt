Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length by 1, potentially causing the transformation to process one extra character than intended, which could lead to incorrect results in the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, otherIter.peekLength() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the length by 1 (or sets it to 0 if the length is 0), which may cause the transformation to skip processing the last character of the `other` delta, leading to incomplete transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length, which could cause the transformation to incorrectly process twice the number of characters, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior in the delta operations.

DONE.
