  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be ignored, which could lead to the code returning different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be used instead of the `countries` object, which could lead to the code returning different results for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const country = countries[id];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `country` variable would be defined but not used, which could lead to the code returning different results for the same input.

DONE.
