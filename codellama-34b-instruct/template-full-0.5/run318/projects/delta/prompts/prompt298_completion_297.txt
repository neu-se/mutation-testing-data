  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the `predicate` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the `predicate` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes && {}, i)

DONE.
