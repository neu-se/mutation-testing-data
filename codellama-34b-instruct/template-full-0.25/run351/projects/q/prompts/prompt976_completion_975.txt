  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `args` variable would be used instead of the default value of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `args` variable would be used instead of the default value of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is a truthy value, so the default value of an empty array would be used instead of the `args` variable.

DONE.
