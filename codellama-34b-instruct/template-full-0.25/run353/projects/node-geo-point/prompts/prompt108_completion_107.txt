  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.pow` function to use a different value for the `zoom` parameter, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `Math.pow` function to use a different value for the `zoom` parameter, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.pow` function to use a different value for the `zoom` parameter, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
