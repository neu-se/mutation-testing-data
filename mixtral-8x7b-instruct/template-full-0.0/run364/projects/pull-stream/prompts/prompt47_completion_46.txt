 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow one more iteration than the original code, potentially processing an additional argument and causing unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument, potentially causing the function to ignore the initial input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i in arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through all the enumerable properties of the arguments object, potentially processing non-argument properties and causing unexpected side effects.

DONE.
