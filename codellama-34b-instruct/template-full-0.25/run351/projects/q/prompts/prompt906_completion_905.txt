  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`. This means that if the `callback` argument is not `undefined`, the code will enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is `null`. This means that if the `callback` argument is `null`, the code will enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is a function, while this replacement checks
