  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `shouldThrow` is a boolean value, while the replacement code fragment `shouldThrow === true` is a comparison that always evaluates to a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `shouldThrow` is a boolean value, while the replacement code fragment `!shouldThrow` is a negation that always evaluates to a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `shouldThrow` is a boolean value, while the replacement code fragment `shouldThrow && true` is a logical AND operation that always evaluates to a boolean value.

DONE.
