  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0
```
This change will cause the code to use a floating-point number instead of an integer, which may result in slightly different behavior when dealing with decimal values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This change will cause the code to use the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2 to the given zoom level, which may result in slightly different behavior when dealing with large or small zoom levels.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This change will cause the code to use the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of 2 to the given zoom level minus 1, which may result in slightly different behavior when dealing with large or small zoom levels.

DONE.
