  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, while `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, while `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `asinh` is the inverse hyperbolic sine function, while `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

DONE.
