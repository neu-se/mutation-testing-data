  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function immediately, whereas the original code fragment would only call it when `busy` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `err` object as the second argument instead of using the original `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `err` object as the first argument and the `abort` argument as the second argument, whereas the original code fragment only passes the `abort` argument.

DONE.
