 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for exact equality with zero instead of checking if the absolute value is smaller than a small constant. This means that small non-zero values of b would not be considered as "close to zero" anymore.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different constant (1 instead of `Complex['EPSILON']`) to compare the absolute value of b with. This means that the tolerance for considering a value as "close to zero" would be much larger, potentially leading to different results in the `toString` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if b is negative, instead of checking if its absolute value is smaller than a small constant. This means that positive values of b, no matter how small, would not
