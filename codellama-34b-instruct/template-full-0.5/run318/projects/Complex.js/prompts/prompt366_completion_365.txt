  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the value of the expression and potentially cause the `acoth` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition by 1 would change the value of the expression and potentially cause the `acoth` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction by 1 would change the value of the expression and potentially cause the `acoth` function to return a different value.

DONE.
