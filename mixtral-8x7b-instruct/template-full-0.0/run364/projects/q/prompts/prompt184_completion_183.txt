 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the input is an object, while this modification checks if the input has a `length` property, which is a common characteristic of arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a consistent value for the same input, while this modification generates a random number, making the function's output unpredictable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Type()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `prototype` property of the `Type` constructor, while this modification creates a new instance of `Type`, which may not have the same properties and methods as the prototype.

DONE.
