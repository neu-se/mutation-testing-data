  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is always `true` when `otherOp.delete` is `false`, whereas `otherOp.delete` is only `true` when the operation is a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherOp.delete` is always `true` when `otherOp.delete` is `false`, whereas `otherOp.retain` is only `true` when the operation is a retention.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is always `undefined` when `otherOp.delete` is `false`, whereas `otherOp.retain` is only `undefined` when the operation is a deletion.

DONE.
