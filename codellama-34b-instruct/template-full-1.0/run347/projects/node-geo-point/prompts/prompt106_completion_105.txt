  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.pow` function with a second argument of 2, which returns the square value of the first argument. Replacing it with `2` would simply return the first argument, which would not be equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.pow` function with a second argument of 2, which returns the cube value of the first argument. Replacing it with `3` would return the cube value, which would not be equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.pow` function with a second argument of 2, which returns the square value of the first argument. Replacing it with `Math.PI` would return a different value, which would not be equivalent.

DONE.
