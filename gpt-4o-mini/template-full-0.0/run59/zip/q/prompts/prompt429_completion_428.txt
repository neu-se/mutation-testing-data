Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `state` property of the object instead of calling the `inspect()` method, which may lead to undefined behavior if `state` is not a direct property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().status
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a non-existent `status` property instead of the correct `state` property, which would cause the function to return `undefined` for rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "resolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a non-existent "resolved" state instead of "rejected", leading to incorrect evaluations of promise states and potentially allowing rejected promises to be treated as fulfilled.

DONE.
