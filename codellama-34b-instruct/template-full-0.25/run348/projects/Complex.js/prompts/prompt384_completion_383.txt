  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the variable `b`, which is used in the calculation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the variable `b` changes the value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to the variable `b` changes the value of the complex number.

DONE.
