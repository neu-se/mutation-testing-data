  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 && a['arg'] < a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a['abs']` is not a finite number and `a['arg']` is a finite number, while the new code checks if `a['abs']` is less than 0 and `a['arg']` is less than `a['abs']`. The `isFinite` function checks if a number is a finite number, while the `< 0` operator checks if a number is less than 0. The `&&` operator requires both operands to be true in order to return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] <= 0 && a['arg'] <= a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a['abs']` is not a finite number and `a['arg']` is a finite number, while the new code checks if `a['abs']` is less than or equal
