  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is not a valid method for the `Dirty` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `off` is a valid method for the `Dirty` class, but it would not cause the desired outcome of emitting the `'drain'` event when the database is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on
```
This would result in different behavior because `on` is a valid method for the `Dirty` class, but it would not cause the desired outcome of emitting the `'drain'` event when the database is closed.

DONE.
