 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `read` function, potentially causing issues if the `read` function relies on the value of `this` to access other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `abort` function when `read` is falsy. In the original code, this would result in an error being thrown, while in the mutated code, it would simply do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {}) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `abort` function when `read` returns a falsy value. In the original code, this would result in the `abort` function being called again with the same arguments, while in the mutated code
