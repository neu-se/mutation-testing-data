  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `become` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the given progress, whereas `become` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `become` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value.

DONE.
