  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest` returns a new iterator that starts from the current position of `thisIter`, while `thisIter.rest.slice(1)` returns a new iterator that starts from the next position of `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest` returns a new iterator that starts from the current position of `otherIter`, while `otherIter.rest.slice(1)` returns a new iterator that starts from the next position of `otherIter`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest.slice(0, 1)` returns a new iterator that starts from the current position of `thisIter` and ends at the next position, while `
