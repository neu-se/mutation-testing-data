  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function passed as the second argument is also different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
