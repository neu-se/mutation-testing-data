  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `b` variable directly, while the replaced code uses twice the value of `b`. This could cause errors if the value of `b` changes during the execution of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b**2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `b` variable directly, while the replaced code uses the square of `b`. This could cause errors if the value of `b` changes during the execution of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `b` variable directly, while the replaced code uses `b` plus 1. This could cause errors if the value of `b` changes during the execution of the program.

DONE.
