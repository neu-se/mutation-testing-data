  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'ftp:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also exclude URLs with the "ftp" protocol, which may be a valid URL in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'file:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also exclude URLs with the "file" protocol, which may be a valid URL in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'data:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also exclude URLs with the "data" protocol, which may be a valid URL in some cases
