  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x) < 1e-9 ? 0 : Math.exp(x)
```
This code fragment uses the `Math.abs` function to check if the input `x` is less than 1e-9, and if so, returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of `Math.exp(x)`. This change is a bug because it will cause the function to return 0 for any input that is less than 1e-9, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
