  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "return null".
This would result in different behavior because the original code snippet returns a promise, while the replaced code snippet returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "throw new Error('error message')".
This would result in different behavior because the original code snippet returns a promise, while the replaced code snippet throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "_.noop()".
This would result in different behavior because the original code snippet returns a promise, while the replaced code snippet does not return anything.

DONE.
