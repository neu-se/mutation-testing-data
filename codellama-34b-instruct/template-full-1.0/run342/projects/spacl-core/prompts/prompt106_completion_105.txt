  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!policy.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the result, causing the `policy.matches` method to return `false` when the original code would have returned `true`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches && policy.isActive
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will only return `true` if both `policy.matches` and `policy.isActive` are `true`. The original code would have returned `true` if `policy.matches` was `true`, regardless of the value of `policy.isActive`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches || policy.isActive
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will only return `false` if both `policy.matches` and `policy.isActive` are `false`. The original code would have returned `false` if `policy.matches`
