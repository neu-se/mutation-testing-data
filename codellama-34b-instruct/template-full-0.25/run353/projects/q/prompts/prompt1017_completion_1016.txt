  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, while `then` is a method that handles fulfillment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles rejection, while `fail` is a method that handles rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that handles both fulfillment and rejection, while `fail` is a method that only handles rejection.

DONE.
