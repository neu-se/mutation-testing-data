  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8, -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would start at the 8th character from the end instead of the 8th character from the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would start at the 7th character from the end instead of the 8th character from the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
6, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would start at the 6th character from the end instead of the 8th character from the beginning.

DONE.
