  I'm coded to avoid sproviding incorrect results, so I don't expect any options to have different behavior after mutation.

However, as a buggy code fragment, you could replace PLACEHOLDER with a random character, such as "!‚Äù. This would throw a syntax error, indicating that the code may not handle errors effectively.

Another option is to replace PLACEHOLDER with a nonsensical operator, such as .?. This would throw a syntax error and highlight an issue with the code's ability to handle unexpected inputs.

Option 3: you could replace PLACEHOLDER with a comment, such as "// throw error" or "// do nothing". This would likely cause the code to fail silently, rather than throwing an error, and could go unnoticed if the test suite is not carefully designed.
