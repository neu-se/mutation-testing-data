  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
twice
```
This would result in different behavior because `twice` is not a valid function in the context of the code, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once(null)` would return a function that is not the same as the original `once` function, and would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `once(function() {})` would return a function that is not the same as the original `once` function, and would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
