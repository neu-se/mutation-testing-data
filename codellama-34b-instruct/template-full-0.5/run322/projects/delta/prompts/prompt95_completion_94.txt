  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the specified index, rather than pushing it onto the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one element from the array at the specified index, and then insert the new op at that same index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 2, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two elements from the array at the specified index, and then insert the new op at that same index.

DONE.
