  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the test will pass even if the promise is rejected, rather than resolved, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the test will pass even if the promise is notified, rather than resolved or rejected, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the test will fail if the promise is not resolved, rather than passing, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
