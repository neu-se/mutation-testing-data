 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to consume one more operation than the original code, potentially skipping an operation in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move backwards instead of forwards, potentially causing it to re-evaluate previously processed operations or even go beyond the beginning of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to skip two operations instead of one, potentially causing it to skip important operations in the `other` delta.

DONE.
