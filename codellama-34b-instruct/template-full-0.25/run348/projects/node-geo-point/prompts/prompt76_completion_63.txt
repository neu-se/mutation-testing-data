  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(θ)` would round the value of `θ` down to the nearest integer, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ + Math.PI` would add `Math.PI` to the value of `θ`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ * 2` would double the value of `θ`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
