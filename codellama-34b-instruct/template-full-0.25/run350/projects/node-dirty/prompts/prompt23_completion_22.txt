  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name, which would not be handled by the event listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name, which would be handled by the event listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('close'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different event name, which would not be handled by the event listener.

DONE.
