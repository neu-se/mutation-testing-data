  Sure, I can help you with that. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback is missing, so any rejections would be unhandled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` callback is an empty function, so it would not have any effect on the overall behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, function () {}, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback is an empty function, so it would not have any effect on the overall behavior of the code.

DONE.
