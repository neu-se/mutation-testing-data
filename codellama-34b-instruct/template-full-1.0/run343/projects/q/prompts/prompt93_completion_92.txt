  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the
`requestTick` function is called only if `flushing` is false, but if the `PLACEHOLDER`
is replaced with `2`, the function would be called regardless of the value of
`flushing`, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<null>
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the`requestTick` function
is called only if `flushing` is false, but if the `PLACEHOLDER` is replaced with `<null>`, the
function would be called regardless of the value of `flushing`, which could cause unintended
side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `requestTick` function
is called only if `flushing` is false,
