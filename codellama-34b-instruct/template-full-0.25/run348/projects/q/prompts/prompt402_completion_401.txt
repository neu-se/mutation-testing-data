  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of throwing it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with the rejection reason as the message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw reason + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a different value than the original rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

DONE.
