  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "mouse" with the plural form "mice", while the buggy code fragment adds a rule for the word "mouse" with the plural form "mouse".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a single rule for the word "mouse" with the plural form "mice", while the buggy code fragment adds two rules for the word "mouse" with the plural form "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
addRule('mouse', 'mouse')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a single rule for the word "mouse" with the plural form "mice",
