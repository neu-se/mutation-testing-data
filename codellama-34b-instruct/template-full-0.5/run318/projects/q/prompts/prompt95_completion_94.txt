  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `>=` which checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length, while the new code uses `>` which checks if the index is strictly greater than the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `++index` which increments the index before checking if it is greater than or equal to the length, while the new code uses `index++` which increments the index after checking if it is greater than or equal to the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `++index` which increments the index before checking if it is greater than or equal to the length, while the new code uses `index + 1` which adds 1 to the index before checking if it is greater than or equal to
