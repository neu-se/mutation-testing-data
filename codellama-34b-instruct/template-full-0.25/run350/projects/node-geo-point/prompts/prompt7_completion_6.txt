  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with two elements, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is an array with two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.every(Number.isFinite)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with two finite numbers, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is an array with two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2 && point.coordinates.every(Number.isFinite)
```
