  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
FLUSH
```
This would result in different behavior because the `FLUSH` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function, but it takes no arguments, whereas `FLUSH` is a function that takes 2 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `FLUSH` is a function call.

DONE.
