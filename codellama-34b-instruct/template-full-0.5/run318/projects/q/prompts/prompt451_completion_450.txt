  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the stack trace of the reason object onto the unhandledReasons array, rather than the reason object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the message property of the reason object onto the unhandledReasons array, rather than the reason object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.name);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the name property of the reason object onto the unhandledReasons array, rather than the reason object itself.

DONE.
