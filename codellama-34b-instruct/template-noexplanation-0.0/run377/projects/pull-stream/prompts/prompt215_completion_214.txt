  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This code fragment will call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This code fragment will call the `abortCb` function with the `err` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This code fragment will call the `abortCb` function without any arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
