  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value. In the original code, `!options.url` would evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is an empty string, but `options.url === undefined` would only evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is actually `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url.length` is the length of the string `options.url`, while `!options.url` would evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url.trim()` removes any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string `options.url`, while `
