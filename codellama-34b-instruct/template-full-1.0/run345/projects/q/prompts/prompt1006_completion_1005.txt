  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the current object, rather than the `object` argument that was passed to the `Q.nsend` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the value 0 as the first argument, rather than the `object` argument that was passed to the `Q.nsend` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a `null` object as the first argument, rather than the `object` argument that was passed to the `Q.nsend` function.

DONE.
