  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index + 1` expression would cause the `next` method to advance the iterator by one more step than it should, potentially skipping over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index - 1` expression would cause the `next` method to advance the iterator by one fewer step than it should, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start - index * 2` expression would cause the `next` method to advance the iterator by twice the necessary amount, potentially skipping over multiple necessary operations.

DONE.
