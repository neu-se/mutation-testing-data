  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, newOp.length, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index in the `splice` method would be equal to the length of `newOp`, so the operation would have no effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
randomIndex, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `randomIndex` variable would be a random number between 0 and the length of `this.ops`, so the operation would have a different behavior depending on the value of `randomIndex`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length, 0, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index in the `splice` method would be equal to `this.ops.length`, so the operation would append `newOp` to the end of `this.ops`.

DONE.
