Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the operation to proceed even when the source and target paths are the same, potentially leading to unintended overwriting of files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the target base path contains the source path as a substring, which is not the intended check for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === path.basename(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if the target base path is exactly the same as the base name of the source path, ignoring the full path comparison.

DONE.
