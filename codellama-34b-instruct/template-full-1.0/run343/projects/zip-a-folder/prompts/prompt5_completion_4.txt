  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is always falsey and would short-circuit the evaluation of `targetFilePath`, meaning that the `targetFilePath` would never be evaluated and the code would always assume that `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is always falsey and would short-circuit the evaluation of `targetFilePath`, meaning that the `targetFilePath` would never be evaluated and the code would always assume that `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is always falsey and would short-circuit the evaluation of `targetFilePath`, meaning that the `targetFilePath` would never be evaluated and the code would always assume that
