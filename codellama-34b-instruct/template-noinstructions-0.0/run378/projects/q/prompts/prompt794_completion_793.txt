  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `progressed` callback, which could potentially cause the callback to behave differently than it would with `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as an argument to the `progressed` callback, which could potentially cause the callback to behave differently than it would with `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string value, and it would be passed as an argument to the `progressed` callback, which could potentially cause the callback to behave differently than it would with `void 0`.

DONE.
