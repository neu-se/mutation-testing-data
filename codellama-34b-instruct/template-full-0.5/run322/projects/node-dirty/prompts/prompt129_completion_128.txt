  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` takes a boolean argument, and passing `false` would cause the stream to be uncorked immediately, instead of waiting for the `'drain'` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` takes a boolean argument, and passing `true` would cause the stream to be corked indefinitely, preventing any data from being written to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size > 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` takes a boolean argument, and passing `this._queue.size > 0` would cause the stream to be corked if there are any items in the queue, and uncorked otherwise
