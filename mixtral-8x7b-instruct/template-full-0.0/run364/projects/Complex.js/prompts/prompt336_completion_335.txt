 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number's imaginary part would be a positive infinity instead of a negative infinity when b is -1 in the 'acot' function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would be (0, 0) instead of (0, Infinity) when a is 0 and b is 0 in the 'acsc' function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would be (0, -Infinity) instead of (0, Infinity) when a is 0 and b is 0 in the 'acsc' function.

DONE.
