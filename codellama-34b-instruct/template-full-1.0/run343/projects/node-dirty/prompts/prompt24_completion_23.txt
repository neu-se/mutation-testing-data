  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called twice, leading to unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called, leading to unexpected behavior when the code relies on its execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called even if the `val` is not `undefined`, leading to unexpected side effects.

DONE.
