  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.emit({ error: err });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an object with the error message as a property, rather than emitting the error object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.emit(err.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a string with the error message, rather than emitting the error object directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    this.emit(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the error object in a different context, which may have different behavior.

DONE.
