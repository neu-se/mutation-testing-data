Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches words that end with 'o' preceded by a consonant, excluding words that end with a vowel followed by 'o', which would change the pluralization rules for certain words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the flag from 'i' (case insensitive) to 'g' (global) would not affect the matching behavior in this context, but it could lead to unexpected results if the regex is used in a different context where multiple matches are relevant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/i && /[aeiou]$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly combines two regex patterns with a logical AND operator, which is not valid in this context and would lead to a runtime error, effectively breaking the pluralization functionality for words ending in 'o'.

DONE.
