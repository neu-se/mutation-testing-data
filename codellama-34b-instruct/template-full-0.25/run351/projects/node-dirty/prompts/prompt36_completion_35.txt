  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the loop, causing the `forEach` method to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the loop, causing the `forEach` method to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, val]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped in the loop, causing the `forEach` method to iterate over the values instead of the keys.

DONE.
