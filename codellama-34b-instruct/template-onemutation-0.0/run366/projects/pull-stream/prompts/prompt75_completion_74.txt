  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `done` function would be called even if it is not defined. In the original code, the `||` operator is used to provide a default value for the `done` callback, so if it is not defined, the `function () {}` would be called instead.

DONE.
