 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return flush(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` callback would be executed immediately, instead of being scheduled to run asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` would be bound to an empty object, which would throw a `TypeError` when the `flush` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` would be bound to `null`, which would throw a `TypeError` when the `flush` function is called.

DONE.
