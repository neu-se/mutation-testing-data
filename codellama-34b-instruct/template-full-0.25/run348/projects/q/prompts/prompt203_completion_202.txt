  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation operator is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is different.

DONE.
