  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `fromPromise` method instead of the `fromCallback` method, which may result in different behavior if the `writeFile` function is called with a promise that resolves to a value other than a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `fromCallback` method with the `fs.writeFile` function as the callback, which may result in different behavior if the `writeFile` function is called with a promise that resolves to a value other than a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `fromCallback` method with the `fs.writeFileSync` function as the callback, which
