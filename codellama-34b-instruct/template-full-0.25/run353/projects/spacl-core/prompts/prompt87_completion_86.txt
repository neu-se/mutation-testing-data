  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clone the rules with a null context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(undefined))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clone the rules with an undefined context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clone the rules with a different context, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
