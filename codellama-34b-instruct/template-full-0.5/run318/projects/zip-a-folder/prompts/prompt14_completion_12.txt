  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the access mode from read-only to write-only, which could cause the `access` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the access mode from read-only to execute-only, which could cause the `access` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the access mode from read-only to file-only, which could cause the `access` function to return a different result.

DONE.
