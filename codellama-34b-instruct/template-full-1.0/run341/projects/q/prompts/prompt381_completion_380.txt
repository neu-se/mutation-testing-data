  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` would throw an error if the first argument is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` would throw an error if the first argument is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` would treat the first argument as a promise and expect it to resolve, but the `Promise` constructor returns a pending promise that never resolves, causing `Q.then` to hang indefinitely.

DONE.
