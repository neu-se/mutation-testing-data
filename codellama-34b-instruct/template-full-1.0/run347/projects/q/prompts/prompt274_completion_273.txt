  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the `deferred.promise` was resolved, while this new code fragment checks if the `deferred` is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (resolvedPromise) {
    become(Q(value));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `become(fulfill(value))` which would resolve the promise with the value, while this new code fragment uses `become(Q(value))` which would wrap the value in a new promise and resolve it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error) {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the error, while this new code fragment would simply return and do nothing.

DONE.
