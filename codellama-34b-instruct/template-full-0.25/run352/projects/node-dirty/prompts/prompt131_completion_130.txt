  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a different object than `this._queue`, and the `for...of` loop would iterate over different elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size` is a different value than `this._queue`, and the `for...of` loop would iterate over a different number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.length` is a different value than `this._queue`, and the `for...of` loop would iterate over a different number of elements.

DONE.
