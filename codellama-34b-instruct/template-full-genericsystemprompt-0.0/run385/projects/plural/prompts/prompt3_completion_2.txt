  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could cause the `addRule` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could cause the `addRule` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could cause the `addRule` function to behave differently.

DONE.
