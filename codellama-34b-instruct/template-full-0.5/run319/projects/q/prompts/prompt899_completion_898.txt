  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a function that always resolves with `null`, regardless of the value passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a function that always resolves with `false`, regardless of the value passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` argument would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a function that always resolves with `0`, regardless of the value passed to it.

DONE.
