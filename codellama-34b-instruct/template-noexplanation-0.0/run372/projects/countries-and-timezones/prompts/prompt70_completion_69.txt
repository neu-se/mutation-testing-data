  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This code fragment will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to be called with a `null` argument, which will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(undefined);
```
This code fragment will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to be called with an `undefined` argument, which will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This code fragment will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to be called with the `timezones[name]` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This may result in different behavior or errors.

DONE.
