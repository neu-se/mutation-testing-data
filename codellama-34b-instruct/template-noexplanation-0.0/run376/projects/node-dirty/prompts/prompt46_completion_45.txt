  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key)) + 1
```
This change will cause the `updater` function to receive a different value than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key)) - 1
```
This change will cause the `updater` function to receive a different value than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key)) * 2
```
This change will cause the `updater` function to receive a different value than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the correct behavior of the `updater` function.

DONE.
