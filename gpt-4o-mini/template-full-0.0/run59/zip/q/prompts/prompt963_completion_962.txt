Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the current context (`this`) to the end of the `args` array instead of adding it to the beginning, which changes the order of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `args` array, which alters the arguments being passed to the function and may lead to unexpected results if the first argument is essential.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(0, 0, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `splice` to insert `this` at the beginning of the `args` array, but the method is more complex and could lead to performance issues or errors if not handled correctly, compared to the straightforward `unshift`.

DONE.
