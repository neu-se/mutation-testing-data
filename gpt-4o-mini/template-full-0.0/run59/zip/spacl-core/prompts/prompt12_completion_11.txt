Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string `spec` contains a colon character instead of matching the entire string against a regex pattern, potentially allowing malformed captures that should have been caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for a specific case where a colon follows a non-slash character, which may not cover all malformed capture scenarios that the original regex intended to catch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/:\/|:$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for a colon followed by a slash or a colon at the end of the string, missing other malformed capture patterns that the original regex was designed to identify.

DONE.
