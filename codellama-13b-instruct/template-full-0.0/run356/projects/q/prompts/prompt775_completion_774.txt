  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the rejection handler in the `allSettled` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `1`, which would not trigger the rejection handler in the `allSettled` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a new deferred object, which would not trigger the rejection handler in the `allSettled` method.

DONE.
