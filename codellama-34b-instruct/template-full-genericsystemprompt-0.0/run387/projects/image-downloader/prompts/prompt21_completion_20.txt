  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is not defined in the function, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `options.dest` string to uppercase, which could cause the file to be saved with a different name than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `options.dest` string on the `.` character, and return the first part of the string, which could cause the file to be saved with a different name than expected.

DONE.
