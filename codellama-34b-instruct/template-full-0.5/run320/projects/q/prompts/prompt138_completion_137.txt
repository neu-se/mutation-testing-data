  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "string" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof error` check would now return "string" instead of "object", which would cause the `error.stack` property to be undefined, even if the `error` object is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "undefined" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof error` check would now return "undefined" instead of "object", which would cause the `error.stack` property to be undefined, even if the `error` object is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
