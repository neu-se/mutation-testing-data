  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ZERO'] = new Complex(1, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ZERO` property of the `Complex` object would be set to a non-zero value, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the `ZERO` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ONE'] = new Complex(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ONE` property of the `Complex` object would be set to a non-one value, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the `ONE` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['I'] = new Complex(1, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `I` property of the `Complex` object would be set to a non-imaginary value, which could cause issues in calculations that rely on the `I` value.
