  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `b`, while the modified code fragment calculates the sine of `b + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `b`, while the modified code fragment calculates the sine of `b - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `b`, while the modified code fragment calculates the sine of `b * 2`.

DONE.
