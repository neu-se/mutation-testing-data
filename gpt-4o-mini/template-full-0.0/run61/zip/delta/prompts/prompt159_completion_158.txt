Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the operation as a delete instead of an insert, potentially leading to incorrect composition of operations and loss of data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly modify the type of operation being checked, leading to unexpected results when composing operations, as it would never match the expected 'insert' type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always evaluate the operation as an insert, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations and potentially result in an infinite loop or incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
