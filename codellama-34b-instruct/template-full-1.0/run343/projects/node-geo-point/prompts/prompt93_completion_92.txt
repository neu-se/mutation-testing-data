  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the value of `θ`, which would cause the calculation of `sinθ` and `cosθ` to yield different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `θ` is multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculation of `sinθ` and `cosθ` to yield different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the value of `θ`, which would cause the calculation of `sinθ` and `cosθ` to yield different results.

DONE.
