  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the argument of the complex number in the opposite direction, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['re'], this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the argument of the complex number in the opposite direction, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], -this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the argument of the complex number in the opposite direction, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
