  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value*2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve(value*2)` would resolve the promise with a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function(v) {return v*2;});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then()` would modify the value of the promise before it is resolved.

DONE.
