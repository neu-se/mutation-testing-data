Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always call `abortCb`, regardless of the value of `abort`, leading to premature termination of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call `abortCb` when `abort` is explicitly `false`, which means that if `abort` is `true` or `undefined`, the callback will be executed instead, potentially allowing further processing when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will call `abortCb` whenever `abort` is anything other than `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `abort` is `undefined` or `false`, allowing the callback to proceed when it should not.

DONE.
