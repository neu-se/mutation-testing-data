 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error code 'ENOTDIR' is related to a directory not being found or not being a directory, which is different than the original 'ENOENT' error code that indicates a file or directory not being found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error code 'EISDIR' is related to an operation that is not supported on a directory, which is different than the original 'ENOENT' error code that indicates a file or directory not being found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error code 'EACCES' is related to a permission denied error, which is different than the original 'ENOENT' error code that indicates a file or directory not being found.
