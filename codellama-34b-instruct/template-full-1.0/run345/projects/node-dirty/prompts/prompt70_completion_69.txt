  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is not a standard one, and therefore will not be handled by any listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load\''
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name has an extra single quote character at the end, which would cause errors when using the `emit` method.

DONE.
