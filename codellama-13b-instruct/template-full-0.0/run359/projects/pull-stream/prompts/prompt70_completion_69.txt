  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would always return `true`, causing the `abort` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would always return `false`, causing the `abort` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && null === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would always return `null`, causing the `abort` function to be called.

DONE.
