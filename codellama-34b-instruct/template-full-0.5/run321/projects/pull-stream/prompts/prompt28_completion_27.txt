  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `ref` array is being used instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `ref` array is being used instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because a different element of the `ref` array is being used for each iteration of the loop.

DONE.
