  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called on the `this._queue` object, which is a `Map` object, and the `delete` method is used to remove a key-value pair from the map. In the original code, the `delete` method is called on the `this._queue` object, but it is not used to remove a key-value pair from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `this._queue` object, which is a `Map` object, and the `get` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a key. In the original code, the `get` method is not called on the `this._queue` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, value)
```
