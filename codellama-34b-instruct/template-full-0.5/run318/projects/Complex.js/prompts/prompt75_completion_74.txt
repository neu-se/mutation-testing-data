  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the end of the array instead of the beginning, potentially skipping over elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(tokens.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the middle element of the array instead of the beginning, potentially skipping over elements.

DONE.
