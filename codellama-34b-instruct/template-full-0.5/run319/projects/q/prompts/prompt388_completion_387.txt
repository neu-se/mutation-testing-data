  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function (value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is different, and it would increment the value by 1 before returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function (value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is different, and it would multiply the value by 2 before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function (value) { return value - 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is different, and it would decrement the value by 1 before returning it.

DONE.
