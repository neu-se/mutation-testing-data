  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || key === "hasOwnProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the key `"hasOwnProperty"`, even if the object does not have that property. This is because the `||` operator is used, which returns the first truthy value it encounters. In this case, `key === "hasOwnProperty"` is always truthy, so the function will always return `true` for that key.

DONE.
