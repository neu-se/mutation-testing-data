  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `lastOp` is `null`, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `lastOp.insert` is `undefined`, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `lastOp.insert` is `undefined`, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

DONE.
