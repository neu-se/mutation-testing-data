  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with a new one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

DONE.
