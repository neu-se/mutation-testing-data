  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may cause the test to fail if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which may cause the test to fail if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `NaN` as the first argument, which may cause the test to fail if the function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
