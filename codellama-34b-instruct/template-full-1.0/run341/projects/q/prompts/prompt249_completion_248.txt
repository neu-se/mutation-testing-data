  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace
```
This would result in a different outcome because `e.stack.replace()` returns the string after replacement, whereas `e.stack.indexOf()` returns the position of the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in a different outcome because `e.stack.length` returns the number of characrters in the stack, whereas `e.stack.indexOf()` returns the position of the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.match()
```
This would result in a different outcome because `e.stack.match()` returns an array of matches, whereas `e.stack.indexOf()` returns the position of the first match.

DONE.
