 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the hardcoded string "mouse" would always map to "mice", bypassing the rule-based logic for other words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the appending of "es" would be applied to all cases, regardless of the specific rule conditions, leading to incorrect pluralization for many words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method is used in the original code to add rules at the beginning of the array, ensuring they are checked first. Using `push` would add rules at the end, causing them to be checked after the default "add s" rule, leading to incorrect pluralization for many words.

DONE.
