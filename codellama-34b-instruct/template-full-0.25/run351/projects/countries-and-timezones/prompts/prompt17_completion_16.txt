  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r || id
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error. However, if `tz.r` is defined, it would be used instead of `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r && id
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error. However, if `tz.r` is defined, it would be used instead of `id`.

DONE.
