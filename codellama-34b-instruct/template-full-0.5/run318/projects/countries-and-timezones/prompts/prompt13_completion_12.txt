  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the `current` array, even if it was already present, and it would always add the current timezone to the `all` array, even if it was already present. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to return incorrect results if the same timezone was used multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the current timezone to the `current` array, even if it was already present, and it would always add the current timezone to the `all` array, even if it was already present. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to return incorrect results if the same timezone was used multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all
