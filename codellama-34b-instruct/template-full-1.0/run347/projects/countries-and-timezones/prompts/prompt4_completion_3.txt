  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would always return an empty object, instead of building a timezones map based on the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezonesMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `if` statement to always fail and return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.hasOwnProperty(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property exists in the `timezonesMap` object, instead of checking if the `timezonesMap` object is falsy.

DONE.
