  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause an error when attempting to call `apply` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object, and would not have the same behavior as the original `null` value when used as the `this` argument in the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function would be created, and would not have the same behavior as the original `null` value when used as the `this` argument in the `apply` method.

DONE.
