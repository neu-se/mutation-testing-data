  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = null;
```
This change will cause the loop to exit immediately, as `null` is a falsy value and the loop condition `key in object` will be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = undefined;
```
This change will cause the loop to exit immediately, as `undefined` is a falsy value and the loop condition `key in object` will be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "foo";
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the object's properties, but the loop condition `key in object` will always be true, as the property "foo" is always defined on the object.

DONE.
