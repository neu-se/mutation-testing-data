  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `a` variable is negative, positives `b` values will produce an incorrect result, unlike the original code fragment which will produce `-b` when `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `a` and `b` variables are positive, the result would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `a` and `b` variables are positive, the result would be incorrect.

DONE.
