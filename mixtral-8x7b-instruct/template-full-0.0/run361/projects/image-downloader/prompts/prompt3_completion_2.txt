 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Missing required url'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and it might not be as clear about the missing `options.url`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('The url is required in options')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be constructed differently, and it might not be as clear about the missing `options.url`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a resolved Promise instead of rejecting it, which might cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
