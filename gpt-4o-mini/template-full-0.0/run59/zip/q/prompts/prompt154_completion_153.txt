Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"; " + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "; "
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the line separator from newline characters to semicolons, which would alter the formatting of the stack trace, making it less readable and potentially confusing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "Error occurred" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` with a static string "Error occurred", which does not provide the context of the previous event, thus losing important information in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the newline character from `\n` to `\r\n`, which may affect how the stack trace is displayed on different platforms, potentially leading to unexpected formatting issues.

DONE.
