  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r?\n/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegExp pattern has been modified to match both "\n" and "\r\n" characters, which could lead to different results in the string replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\n/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegExp pattern has been modified to match only the start of the string, which could lead to different results in the string replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]+/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the RegExp pattern has been modified to match one or more occurrences of "\r" or "\n" characters, which could lead to different results in the string replacement.

DONE.
