  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always be positive, whereas the original `a` expression could be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would always be negative, whereas the original `a` expression could be positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would always be twice as large as the original `a` expression, whereas the original expression could be any value.

DONE.
