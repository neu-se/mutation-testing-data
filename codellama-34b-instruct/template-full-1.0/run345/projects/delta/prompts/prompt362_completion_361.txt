  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisIter.next().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` is a function that advances the iterator to the next element of the iterable, so it would return the next element after the one being tested, instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisIter.peek().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` allows the iterator to return the current element, but it will not advance the iterator to the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would always be zero, regardless of the length of the current element being tested.

DONE.
