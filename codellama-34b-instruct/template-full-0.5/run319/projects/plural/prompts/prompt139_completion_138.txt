  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` returns the original word, while `word.substring(1)` returns the original word without the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` returns the original word, while `word.toUpperCase()` returns the original word in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` returns the original word, while `word.length` returns the length of the original word.

DONE.
