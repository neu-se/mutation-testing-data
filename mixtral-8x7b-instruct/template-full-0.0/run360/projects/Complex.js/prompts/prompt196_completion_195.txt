 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the sine function would be different, as it takes an integer argument in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the imaginary part, even when the original code fragment would return a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input, while the original code fragment returns a value based on the input.

DONE.
