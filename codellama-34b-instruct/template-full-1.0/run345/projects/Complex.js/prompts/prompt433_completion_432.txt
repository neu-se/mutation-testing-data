  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an off-by-one error into the calculation, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the result of the calculation to be NaN, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places = -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the result of the calculation to be -Infinity, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
