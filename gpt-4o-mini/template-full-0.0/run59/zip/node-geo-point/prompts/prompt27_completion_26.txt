Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which will lead to incorrect calculations in the distance formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
90
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the latitude value with a constant (90), which is the maximum valid latitude, potentially leading to incorrect distance calculations when the actual latitude is less than 90.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of `point2` instead of `point1`, which will yield an incorrect distance calculation as it mixes the coordinates of the two points.

DONE.
