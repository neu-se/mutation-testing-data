  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise with the result of `deferred.reject`, which is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise with the result of `deferred.resolve`, which is a resolved promise.

DONE.
