  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to add a new entry to the map, whereas the original code uses the `set` method to update an existing entry.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to remove an entry from the map, whereas the original code uses the `set` method to update an existing entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is used to remove all entries from the map, whereas the original code uses the `set` method to update an existing entry.

DONE.
