  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is uncurried, meaning it takes all its arguments as a single array. In this case, `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)` would return a function that takes an array as its argument and returns a new array that is a slice of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.map)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis(Array.prototype.map)` would return a function that takes an array as its argument and returns a new array that is the result of applying the `map` function to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.filter)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis
