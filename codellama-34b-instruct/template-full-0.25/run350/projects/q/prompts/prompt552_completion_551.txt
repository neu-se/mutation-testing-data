  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will create a rejected promise, whereas `when` will create a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` will create a fulfilled promise, whereas `when` will create a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` will create a new deferred object, whereas `when` will return a promise for the result of the operation.

DONE.
