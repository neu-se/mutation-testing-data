  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || this['isNaN']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for `isNaN()`, which would return `false` for `Infinity` and `NaN`, while the new code checks for both `isInfinite()` and `isNaN()`, which would return `true` for `Infinity` and `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['isNaN']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `isNaN()` first, which would return `false` for `Infinity` and `NaN`, while the new code checks for both `isInfinite()` and `isNaN()` in a logical AND, which would return `false` for `Infinity` and `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['im'] === Infinity) {
