  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/chili$/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "chili" is not recognized by the plural module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/uy$|quy$/i`
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "uy" is not recognized by the plural module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/ says goings shapes/i`
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "says" is not recognized by the plural module.

DONE.
