  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, 'invalid_name')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function will not find the matching timezone data for the invalid name 'invalid_name', causing the returned timezone object to be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(null, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function will receive a null data object, causing the function to throw a null pointer exception when trying to access the `timezones` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data[name], name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function will receive a timezone data object for the given name, but the object will not contain the `name` property, causing the function to return an undefined object.

DONE.
