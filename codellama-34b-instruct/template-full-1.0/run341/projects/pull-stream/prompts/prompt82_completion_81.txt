  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that is expected to be called with an argument, but by replacing it with `undefined`, the function will be called with no arguments, which could cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that is expected to be called with an argument, but by replacing it with `null`, the function will be called with no arguments, which could cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that is expected to be called with an argument, but by replacing it with an arrow function that takes no arguments, the function will be called with no arguments, which could cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
