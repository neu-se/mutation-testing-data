 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the latitude is 90 or -90 degrees, whereas the original code would return Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the base-10 logarithm instead of the natural logarithm, which could affect the accuracy of the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arcsine instead of the arctangent, which would give incorrect results for the `calculateBearing` method.

DONE.
