  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `name` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `name` string starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `name` string into an array of substrings using a space character as the delimiter, and then return the first element of the array, which could potentially cause the `get()` method to return a different value.

DONE.
