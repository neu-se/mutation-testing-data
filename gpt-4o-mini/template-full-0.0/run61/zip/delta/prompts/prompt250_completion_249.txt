Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect operations being processed in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the length returned by `otherIter.peekLength`, which could cause an off-by-one error in the processing of operations, leading to incorrect diffs being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length returned by `otherIter.peekLength`, which could result in processing more operations than intended, potentially causing incorrect diffs or unexpected behavior in the `diff` function.

DONE.
