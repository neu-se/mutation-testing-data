  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for `zipArchive.pipe()`, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream('invalid_file_path')
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream()` would throw an error if the provided file path is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream('./some_directory')
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream()` would create a file in the `./some_directory` folder, which would be different from the original code behavior.

DONE.
