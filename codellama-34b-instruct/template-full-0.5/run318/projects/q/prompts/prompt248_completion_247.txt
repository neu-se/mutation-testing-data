  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start searching for the last occurrence of "\n" in the stack trace, instead of the first one. This could potentially lead to different line numbers being reported in the stack trace, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the first occurrence of "\n" in the stack trace, but then subtract 1 from the index. This could potentially lead to a negative index, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the first occurrence of "\n" in the stack trace, and then add 2 to the index. This could potentially lead to a different line number being reported in the stack
