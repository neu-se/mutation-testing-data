  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is incremented by 1, which could cause the `Math.expm1` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is decremented by 1, which could cause the `Math.expm1` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is multiplied by 2, which could cause the `Math.expm1` function to return a different value.

DONE.
