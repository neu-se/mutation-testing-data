  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the parent context instead of the current context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.child
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the child context instead of the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.sibling
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the sibling context instead of the current context.

DONE.
