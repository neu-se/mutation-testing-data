  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezone` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `timezone` is strictly equal to `null`. If `timezone` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would not.

DONE.
