  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is not a function, so the line `newOp.insert(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` is not an object, so the line `newOp.attributes[<PLACEHOLDER>]` would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` is not a number, so the line `newOp.retain = <PLACEHOLDER>;` would throw an error.

DONE.
