  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an undefined value instead of a rejected promise, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a null value instead of a rejected promise, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
