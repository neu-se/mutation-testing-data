  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` would always return `false`, whereas `Number.isFinite` would return `true` if the argument is a finite number and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` would return `true` if the argument is NaN, whereas `!Number.isFinite` would return `false` for NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInfinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInfinity` would return `true` if the argument is positive or negative infinity, whereas `!Number.isFinite` would return `false` for infinity.

DONE.
