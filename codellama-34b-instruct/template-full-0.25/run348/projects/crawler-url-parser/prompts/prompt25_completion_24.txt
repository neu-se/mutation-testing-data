  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would add the string 'abc' to the fragment identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + 'abc' + 'def'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would add the strings 'abc' and 'def' to the fragment identifier.

DONE.
