  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be set to 0 milliseconds, causing the promise to resolve immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be set to a negative value, causing the promise to never resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be set to "Not a Number", causing an error to be thrown.

DONE.
