  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method would be called on the write stream, which could cause the stream to write data before it is ready to do so, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` method would be called with an empty string, which could cause the write stream to write an empty line, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method would be called on the write stream, which could cause the stream to end prematurely, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
