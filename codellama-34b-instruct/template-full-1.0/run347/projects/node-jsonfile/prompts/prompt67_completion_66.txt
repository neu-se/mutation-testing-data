  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the first occurrence of \uFEFF with the letter 'x', regardless of whether it is the first character in the string or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the first occurrence of \uFEFF with the character at the first position in the content string, regardless of whether it is the first character or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.indexOf('\uFEFF') !== -1 ? content.charAt(content.indexOf('\uFEFF')) : ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the first occurrence of \uFEFF if it exists in the content string, and it would return the character at that position if it does exist. If it does not exist, it would return an empty string.

DONE.
