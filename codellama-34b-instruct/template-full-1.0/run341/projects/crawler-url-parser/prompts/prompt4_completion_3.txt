  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr > _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate to a boolean value rather than a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate to a different result depending on the value of `currentUrlStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the two operands as strings, rather than performing a logical AND operation.

DONE.
