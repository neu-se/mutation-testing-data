  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is assumed to be a promise in the original code, but replacing it with `undefined` would make it a non-promise value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is assumed to be a promise in the original code, but replacing it with `null` would make it a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is assumed to be a promise in the original code, but replacing it with `reject` would make it a rejected promise.

DONE.
