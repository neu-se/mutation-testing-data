  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the second element, instead of from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element, instead of returning the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a reversed version of the `ops` array, instead of the original array.

DONE.
