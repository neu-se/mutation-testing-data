  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (i = 0; i < urlMap.values(); i++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is never called, as the `values()` method returns an iterator object, and the `for...of` loop expects an iterable object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (i = 0; i < urlMap.size; i++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property of a Map object returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, not the number of values. Therefore, the loop would iterate more times than necessary, potentially causing errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (i = 0; i < urlMap.keys().length; i++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an array containing the keys of the map, not the values. Therefore, the loop would iterate over the keys instead of the values, potentially
