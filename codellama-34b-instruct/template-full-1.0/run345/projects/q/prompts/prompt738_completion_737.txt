  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var rejected = Q.defer().reject('error');
return rejected.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates and returns a rejected promise with the value 'error', while `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
