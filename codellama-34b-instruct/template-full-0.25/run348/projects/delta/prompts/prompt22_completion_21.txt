  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would always return the opposite of what `isEqual` returns, which could cause the `diff` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key] !== b[key]` would check if the values at the same key in the two objects are not equal, which could cause the `diff` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key] === b[key]` would check if the values at the same key in the two objects are equal, which could cause the `diff` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
