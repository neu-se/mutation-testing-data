  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would not be called on `src`, and the `forEach` loop would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart + '*');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `glob` method would be called with a different pattern, which would not match the original files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {
        ignore: ['**/node_modules/**'],
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `glob` method would be called with a different set of options, which would exclude the `node_
