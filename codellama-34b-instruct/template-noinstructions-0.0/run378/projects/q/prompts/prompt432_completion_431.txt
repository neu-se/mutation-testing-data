  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise is pending.

DONE.
