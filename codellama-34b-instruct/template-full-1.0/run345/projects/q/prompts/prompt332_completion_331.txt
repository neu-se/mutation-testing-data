  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because if any of the methods in the descriptor (`then`, `resolve`, `reject`, etc.) throw an exception, the promise returned by `Q.makePromise` would be rejected with that exception, rather than fulfilling with the return value of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Promise rejected"));

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(result).then(function (newValue) {
    deferred.notify(newValue);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because if any of the methods in the descriptor (`then
