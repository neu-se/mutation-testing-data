  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
