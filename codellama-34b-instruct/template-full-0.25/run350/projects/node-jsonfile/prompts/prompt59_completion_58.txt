  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching carriage returns instead of line feeds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now a carriage return instead of a line feed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is now an empty string instead of a line feed.

DONE.
