  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is 2, but in the mutated code, it is 3. This could cause the function to access a different element in the array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is 2, but in the mutated code, it is 0. This could cause the function to access a different element in the array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
