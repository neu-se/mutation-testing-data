  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Boolean)(currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because the (Boolean) cast would convert the result of the logical AND operation to a boolean value, which would be different from the original code where the result was a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic would be inverted, causing the function to return null if the currentUrlStr is not empty and does not have illegal characters, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only return null if the currentUrlStr has illegal characters and starts with 'http', while the original code would return null if the currentUrlStr has
