  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a rejection reason that is not an error object, which could cause issues in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejection reason, which could cause issues in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Different error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message, which could cause issues in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
