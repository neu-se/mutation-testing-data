  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `undefined` is not a string, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `null` is not a string, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `''` is an empty string, so the comparison would return `true` if `lastOp.insert` is an empty string.

DONE.
