  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done === undefined` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is not passed as an argument. This would cause the `if` statement to always execute the `else` block, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done.length` would always be `0`, even if `done` is not passed as an argument. This would cause the `if` statement to always execute the `else` block, which would not be the case with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `!done.call` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` is
