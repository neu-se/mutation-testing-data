  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) !== 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be
