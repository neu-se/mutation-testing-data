  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && !(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the expression, causing the `onAbort` function to be called with the opposite value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort === false ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort === false` expression would be evaluated as `true` if `abort` is not `true`, causing the `onAbort` function to be called with `null` instead of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort !== true ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort !== true` expression would be evaluated as `true` if `abort` is not `true`, causing the `onAbort` function to be called with `null` instead of `abort
