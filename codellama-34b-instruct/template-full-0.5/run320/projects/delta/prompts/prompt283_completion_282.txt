  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` would return the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` would return the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0, 1)` would return the first character of the `insert` property, whereas `indexOf` would return the index of the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('')` would split the `insert` property into an array of individual characters, whereas `indexOf` would return the index of the specified value.

DONE.
