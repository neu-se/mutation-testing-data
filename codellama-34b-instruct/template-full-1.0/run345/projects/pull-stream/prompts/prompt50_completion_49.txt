  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s instanceof Function` would check if `s` is an instance of the `Function` class, whereas `typeof s === 'function'` checks if `s` is of type `function`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor == Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.constructor` would return the constructor function of `s`, whereas `Function` is a constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.isFunction` would check if `s` is a function, whereas `typeof s === 'function'` checks if `s` is of type `function`.

DONE.
