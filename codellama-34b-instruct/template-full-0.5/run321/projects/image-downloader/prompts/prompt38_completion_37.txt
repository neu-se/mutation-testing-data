  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"wrong_dest"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is used to create a write stream, but the replaced code fragment uses a different variable name, which would cause the write stream to be created with a different destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dest" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is used to create a write stream, but the replaced code fragment appends a "1" to the `dest` variable, which would cause the write stream to be created with a different destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dest".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is used to create a write stream, but the replaced code fragment converts the `dest` variable to uppercase, which would cause the write stream to be created with a different destination.

DONE.
