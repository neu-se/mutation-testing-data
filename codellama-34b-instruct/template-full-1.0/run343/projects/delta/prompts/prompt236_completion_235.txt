  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a different object, possibly with different attributes and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anotherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a different iterator, possibly with different values or attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be a different value, possibly causing the code to throw an error when it tries to use the null value as an object.

DONE.
