  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different function than `fulfill`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(otherValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherValue` is a different value than `value`, and it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
