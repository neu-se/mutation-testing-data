  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `null` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `123` is a number.

DONE.
