  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] < value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to false when the value of `this[i]` and `value` are equal, whereas the original statement would evaluate to true in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] > value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true when `this[i]` is greater than `value`, whereas the original statement would evaluate to false in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true when `i` is less than `value`, whereas the original statement would evaluate to false in that case.

DONE.
