  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 1 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in a `-` being prepended to the token, regardless of the parity of `minus`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '' : '-') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in an empty string being prepended to the token, regardless of the parity of `minus`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '-') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always result in a `+` being prepended to the token, regardless of the parity of `minus`.

DONE.
