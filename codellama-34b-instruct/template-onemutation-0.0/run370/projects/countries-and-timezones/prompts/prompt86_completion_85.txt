  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `c` object as the first argument to `getCountry`, instead of passing the `c` object itself. This could potentially cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
