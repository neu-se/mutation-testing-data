  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses a backslash. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly and return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses an empty string. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly and return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to indicate the end of the path, while the replaced code uses a space. This could cause the code to interpret the path incorrectly and return an incorrect result.

DONE.
