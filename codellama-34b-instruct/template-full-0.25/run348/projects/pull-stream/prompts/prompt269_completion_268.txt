  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended, while `null` is a null value that does not have any meaning in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended, while `undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended, while `true` is a boolean value that indicates that the stream has ended.

DONE.
