  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest()).concat(delta).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` function would be called on the wrong object, causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(otherIter.rest()).concat(delta).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` function would be called on the wrong object, causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(thisIter.rest())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` function would be called on the wrong object, causing the resulting delta to be incorrect.

DONE.
