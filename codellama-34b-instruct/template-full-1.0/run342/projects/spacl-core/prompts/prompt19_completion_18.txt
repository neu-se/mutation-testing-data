  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `endsWith()` checks if the string ends with the given substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.charAt(0) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.charAt(0)` returns the character at the 0th index of the string, while `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` check for substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 2 && string.substring(0, 2) === '//'
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(0, 2)` returns the substring starting at the 0th index and ending at the 2nd index, while `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` check for substrings.
