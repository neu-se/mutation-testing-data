  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the `ended` value to the callback, while `cb(null)` would always pass `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the `ended` value to the callback, while `cb(ended)` would always pass the value of `ended` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the `ended` value to the callback, while `cb(null, data)` would always pass `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

DONE.
