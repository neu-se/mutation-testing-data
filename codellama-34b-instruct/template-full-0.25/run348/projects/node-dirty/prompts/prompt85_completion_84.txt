  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `'\n'` as the separator, while this code uses `'\t'` as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `'\n'` as the separator, while this code uses `' '` as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `'\n'` as the separator, while this code uses `''` as the separator.

DONE.
