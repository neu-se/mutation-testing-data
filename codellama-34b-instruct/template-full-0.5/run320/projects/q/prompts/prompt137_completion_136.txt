  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator would return "undefined" even if ReturnValue is defined but has a value of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if ReturnValue is not only defined but also has a value other than undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if ReturnValue is undefined, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

DONE.
