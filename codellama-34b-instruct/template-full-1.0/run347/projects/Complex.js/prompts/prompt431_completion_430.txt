  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the imaginary component of the number instead of the real component, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be subtracting the value of `places` from the real component of the number, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the value of `places` to the imaginary component of the number, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

DONE.
