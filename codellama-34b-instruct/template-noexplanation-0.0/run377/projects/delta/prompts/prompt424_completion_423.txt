  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || !priority)
```
This change will cause the `transformPosition` method to behave differently than the original code fragment, which was:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || !priority)
```
The change will cause the method to return a different value for the `index` parameter, which may affect the behavior of the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
