  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().then(function() { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the rejection reason directly, while the new code fragment throws the reason inside a nested `then` callback, which would cause the rejection to be handled by the next `then` or `catch` handler in the chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().catch(function() { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the rejection reason directly, while the new code fragment throws the reason inside a `catch` callback, which would cause the rejection to be handled by the next `catch` handler in the chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().done(function() { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the rejection reason directly, while the new code fragment throws the reason inside a `done` callback
