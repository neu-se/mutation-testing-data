  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially applying the wrong rule to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, and the plural function would always return the default value of "word + 's'".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, and the plural function would always return the last rule in the rules array.

DONE.
