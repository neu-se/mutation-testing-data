  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of returning the value of `a` and `b` as is intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `b` from `a` instead of returning the value of `a` and `b` as is intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `a` from `b` instead of returning the value of `a` and `b` as is intended.

DONE.
