  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the first `a` element, while this new code fragment would get the `href` attribute of all `a` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').first().attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `first` method to get the first `a` element, while this new code fragment would get the first `a` element and then get its `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').last().attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `last` method to get the last `a` element, while this new code fragment would get the last `a` element and then get its `href` attribute.

DONE.
