  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This code fragment is different from the original `linkurl` because it accesses the `path` property of the `linkurl` object, which may have a different value than the `linkurl` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This code fragment is different from the original `linkurl` because it accesses the `host` property of the `linkurl` object, which may have a different value than the `linkurl` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This code fragment is different from the original `linkurl` because it accesses the `protocol` property of the `linkurl` object, which may have a different value than the `linkurl` object itself.

DONE.
