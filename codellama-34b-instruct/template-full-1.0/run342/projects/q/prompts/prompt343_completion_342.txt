  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch the function called based on the promise's resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.then(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first call the fulfilled function and then pass its result to the rejected function, which may or may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(fulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first call the rejected function and then pass its result to the fulfilled function, which may or may not be intended.

DONE.
