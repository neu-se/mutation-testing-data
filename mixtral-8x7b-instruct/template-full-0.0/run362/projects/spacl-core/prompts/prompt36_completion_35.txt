 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.concat(spec.split('').slice(1).reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the characters within each segment of the path, instead of reversing the order of the segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the segments, but does not properly handle the case where the input string does not end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the segments, but does not include the last segment in the resulting array.

DONE.
