  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different method than "delete", and setting a property to undefined is different from deleting it altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because "foo" is not a known property or method, and it would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [this.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because in this context, "this" refers to the promise, and "name" is a different property than "key".

DONE.
