 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is changed, which can affect subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the result to the reciprocal of the original result, which can cause division by zero if `a` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the absolute value of the input, which can cause loss of information about the sign of the input.

DONE.
