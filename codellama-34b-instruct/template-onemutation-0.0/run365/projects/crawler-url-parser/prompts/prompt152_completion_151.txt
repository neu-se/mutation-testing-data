  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while the new code fragment checks for greater than. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have more path parts than the current page, even if the path parts are the same.

DONE.
