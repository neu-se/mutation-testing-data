  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.delete` is a different value than `baseOp.attributes`, which could cause the `AttributeMap.invert()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain` is a different value than `baseOp.attributes`, which could cause the `AttributeMap.invert()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is a different value than `baseOp.attributes`, which could cause the `AttributeMap.invert()` method to return a different result.

DONE.
