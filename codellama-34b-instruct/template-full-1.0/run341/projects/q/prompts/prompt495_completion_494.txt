  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(null, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `trackRejection` with a `null` promise, which would not be expected in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `untrackRejection` with a promise that is not currently being tracked, which would not be expected in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `trackRejection` with the same arguments as the original code, except that the `promise` argument would be different. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `promise` argument is used differently in the `trackRejection` function.

DONE.
