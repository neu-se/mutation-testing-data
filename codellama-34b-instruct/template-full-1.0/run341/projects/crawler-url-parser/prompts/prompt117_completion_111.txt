  Thank you for explaining the information. 

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype
```
This would result in a syntax error because `gettype` is not a defined function in the provided code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in a different return value because `typeof` is a keyword in JavaScript that returns the data type of a variable, whereas `gettype` is a custom function that is not defined in the provided code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse
```
This would result in a different return value because `parse` is a function in the provided code that takes two parameters, whereas `gettype` is a function that takes one parameter.

DONE.
