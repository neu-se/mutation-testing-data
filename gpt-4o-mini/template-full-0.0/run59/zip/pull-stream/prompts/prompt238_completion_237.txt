Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, function() { cb(end, null); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback to pass `null` as the data instead of the original `data`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the data in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `end` value by incrementing it, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or behave incorrectly based on the expected end condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, function() { cb(null, data); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback to `null`, which may lead to incorrect error handling or processing of the data in the callback.

DONE.
