 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:[a-zA-Z0-9]+:)?\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires the scheme to only contain alphanumeric characters, while the original regular expression allows any character in the scheme.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:\w+):\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `\w` instead of `(?:\w+)`, which would only match a single word character instead of one or more word characters in the scheme.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^(?!(?:[a-zA-Z]+):\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only allows alphabetic characters in the scheme, while the original regular expression allows any character in the scheme.

These changes would result in different behavior because they would affect the matching
