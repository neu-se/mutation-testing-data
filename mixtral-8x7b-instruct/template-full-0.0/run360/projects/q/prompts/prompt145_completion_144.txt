 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_defineProperty` function expects an object as the first argument, and null would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_defineProperty` function expects an object as the first argument, and an array would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_defineProperty` function expects an object as the first argument, and a function would cause an error.

DONE.
