  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would not remove the fragment from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, 'new-fragment')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the fragment with a new one, instead of removing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would not remove the fragment from the URL.

DONE.
