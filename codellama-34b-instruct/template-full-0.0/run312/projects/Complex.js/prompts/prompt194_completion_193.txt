  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is being used instead of the `re` property, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to receive a different set of arguments and produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being used, but with an offset of 1 added to it. This would cause the `Complex` constructor to receive a different set of arguments and produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being used, but with a multiplication factor of 2. This would cause the `Complex` constructor to receive a different set of arguments and produce a different result.

DONE.
