  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is always truthy, so the `op` function would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` expression is always falsy, so the `op` function would always be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end === true` expression is only true when `end` is strictly equal to `true`, so the `op` function would only be called when `end` is strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
