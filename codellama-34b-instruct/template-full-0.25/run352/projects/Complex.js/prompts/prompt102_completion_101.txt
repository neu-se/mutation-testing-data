  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(plus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the plus sign is now used instead of the minus sign, which would cause the sign of the imaginary part to be flipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 is added to the imaginary part, which would cause the result to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part is multiplied by 2, which would cause the result to be different from the original code.

DONE.
