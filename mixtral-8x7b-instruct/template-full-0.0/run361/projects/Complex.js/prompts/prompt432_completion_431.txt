 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the imaginary part, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the unmodified imaginary part, instead of dividing it by `places` and rounding it.

DONE.
