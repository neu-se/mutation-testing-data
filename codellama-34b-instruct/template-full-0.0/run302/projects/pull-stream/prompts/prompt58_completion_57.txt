  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done === null` would always be false, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done !== null` would always be true, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof done` would be `'function'` if `done` is provided as an argument, and `'undefined'` if it is not provided.

DONE.
