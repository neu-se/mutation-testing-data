Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `a` instead of `b`, meaning that the values from `a` would overwrite those in `b`, which is the opposite of the intended functionality where `b` should overwrite `a` when `priority` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `a` instead of `b`, potentially leading to attributes from `a` being used to overwrite those in `b`, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).filter(key => a[key] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys in `b` that also exist in `a`, effectively ignoring any keys in `b` that are not present in `a`, which contradicts the purpose of merging attributes from both objects.

DONE.
