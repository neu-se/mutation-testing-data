  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `this` is an empty array, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `index` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `this` is an empty array, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` if `index` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 in this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `this` is an empty array, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` if `index` is 0.

DONE.
