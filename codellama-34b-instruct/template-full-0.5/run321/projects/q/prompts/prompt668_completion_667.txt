  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method on the object, rather than the "post" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "post" method on the object, rather than the "apply" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "post" method on the object, rather than the "apply" method.

DONE.
