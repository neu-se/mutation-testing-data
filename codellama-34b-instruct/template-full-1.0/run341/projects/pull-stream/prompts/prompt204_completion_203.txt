  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would cause an error when the code tries to call it.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would cause an error when the code tries to call it.

DONE.
