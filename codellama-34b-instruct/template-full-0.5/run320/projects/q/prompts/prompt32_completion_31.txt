  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, while this code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = noop;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment runs the task, while this code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment runs the task, while this code fragment does not.

DONE.
