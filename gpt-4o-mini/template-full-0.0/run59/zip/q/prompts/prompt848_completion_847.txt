Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `deferred` as a resolved promise, meaning that the promise will never reject, regardless of the timeout or any errors that occur.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} };
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a `deferred` object that lacks the proper promise functionality, leading to unhandled promise rejections and potentially causing the application to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer().then(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a `deferred` object that is immediately chained with a `then` handler, which alters the intended flow of the promise resolution and may lead to unexpected results or timing issues.

DONE.
