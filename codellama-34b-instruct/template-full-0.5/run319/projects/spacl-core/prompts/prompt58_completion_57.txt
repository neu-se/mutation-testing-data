  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment would match the second capture group instead of the first, which could cause unexpected results in the matcher.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment would match the entire string instead of the first capture group, which could cause unexpected results in the matcher.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment would match the first capture group, but the capture group would be empty, which could cause unexpected results in the matcher.

DONE.
