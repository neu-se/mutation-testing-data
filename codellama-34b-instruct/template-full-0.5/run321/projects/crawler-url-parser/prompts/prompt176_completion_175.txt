  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(0, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a different string than the original `url` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property would return a different number than the original `url` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf("https")
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method would return a different number than the original `url` variable.

DONE.
