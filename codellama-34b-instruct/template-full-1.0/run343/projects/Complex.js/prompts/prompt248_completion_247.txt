  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm2` is not a valid method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` expects a single argument, but `this['im']` is not a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is a function that expects a single argument, but `this['re']` is not a valid argument.

DONE.
