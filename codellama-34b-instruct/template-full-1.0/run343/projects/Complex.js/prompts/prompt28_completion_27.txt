  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. In the context of the given code fragment, replacing `Math.abs` with `Math.sqrt` would cause the code to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x / y` would divide the `x` variable by the `y` variable, returning the floating-point result of the division. In the context of the given code fragment, replacing `Math.abs` with `x / y` would cause the code to calculate the ratio of the `x` variable to the `y` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value that represents the number zero
