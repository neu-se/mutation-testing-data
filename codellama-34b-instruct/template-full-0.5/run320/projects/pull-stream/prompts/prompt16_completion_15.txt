  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be incremented by 1, which could affect the behavior of the `switch` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be decremented by 1, which could affect the behavior of the `switch` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be multiplied by 2, which could affect the behavior of the `switch` statement.

DONE.
