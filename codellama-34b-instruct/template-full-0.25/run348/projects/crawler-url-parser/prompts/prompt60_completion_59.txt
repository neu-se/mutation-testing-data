  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `resolve` option set to `true`, which would cause the URL to be resolved relative to the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `resolve` option set to `true`, but the `normalize` option would be set to `false`, which would cause the URL to be resolved relative to the base URL but not normalized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `resolve` option set to `false`, but the `normalize` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the URL to be normalized but not resolved relative to the base
