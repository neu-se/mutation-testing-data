  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('error'), err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not called with the correct arguments. The `emit` method takes an event name as the first argument and an optional value as the second argument, but here we are passing an `Error` object as the first argument and a variable `err` as the second argument. This would cause the `emit` method to throw an error and the code would not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is not called with the correct arguments. The `emit` method takes an event name as the first argument and an optional value as the second argument, but here we are passing a string 'error' as the first argument and `null` as the second argument. This would cause the `emit` method to emit an `error` event with a value of `null`, which is not the intended behavior.
