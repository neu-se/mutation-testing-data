Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'
//a stream that errors immediately.
module.exports = function error (err) {
  return function (abort, cb) {
    <PLACEHOLDER>(err)
  }
}


```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
cb
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
