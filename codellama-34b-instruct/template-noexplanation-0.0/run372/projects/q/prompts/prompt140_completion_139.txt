  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the logical NOT operator instead of the negation operator. This change will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as the value of `p` will always be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && false
```
This code fragment uses the logical AND operator to combine the value of `p` with the value `false`. This will cause the loop to exit after the first iteration, as the result of the expression will always be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p || true
```
This code fragment uses the logical OR operator to combine the value of `p` with the value `true`. This will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as the result of the expression will always be `true`.

DONE.
