 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for specific values of real and imaginary parts instead of checking if the complex number is close to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(this['re']) < Number.EPSILON && Math.abs(this['im']) < Number.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an absolute tolerance for real and imaginary parts, which might not be desired in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']() || this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it considers a complex number with both real and imaginary parts equal to zero as zero, even if the `isZero` method would return false.

DONE.
