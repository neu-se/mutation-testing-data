  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the second argument to the substr() method, while the new code fragment uses a constant value of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the second argument to the substr() method, while the new code fragment uses a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the second argument to the substr() method, while the new code fragment uses a different calculation to determine the second argument.

DONE.
