  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<some other variable>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different variable than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point rather than the longitude of the first point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const randNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 360) - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random longitude rather than the longitude of the first point.

DONE.
