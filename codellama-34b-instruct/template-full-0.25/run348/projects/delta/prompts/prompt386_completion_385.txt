  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be incremented by the sum of the lengths of the two iterators, rather than just the length of the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be decremented by the difference between the lengths of the two iterators, rather than just the length of the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be multiplied by the product of the lengths of the two iterators, rather than just the length of the current iterator.

DONE.
