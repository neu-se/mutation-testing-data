  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment is using `b + 1`, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment is using `a - b`, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `b` directly, while the replaced code fragment is using `Math.abs(b)`, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
