Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any trailing letters instead of trailing zeros after a decimal point, potentially altering the parsing of numeric values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\d+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all trailing digits, not just zeros after a decimal point, which could significantly alter the parsing of numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^0-9.]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any non-numeric character (except for decimal points) at the end of the string, which could lead to incorrect parsing of numeric values if the original string contained such characters.

DONE.
