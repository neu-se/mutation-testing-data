  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next` function with the `data` argument instead of the `cb` function, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `data` argument instead of the `end` argument, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `data` argument instead of the `end` argument, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
