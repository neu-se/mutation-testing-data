  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `timezonesMap` variable to be reassigned to a new object, even if it was already initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `timezonesMap` variable to be reassigned to an empty object, even if it was already initialized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.current = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `current` property of the `timezonesMap` object to be reassigned to an empty array, even if it was already initialized.

DONE.
