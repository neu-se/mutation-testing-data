  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means that the `substr` method would start at the beginning of the string, while `1` would start at the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means that the `substr` method would start at the beginning of the string, while `-1` would start at the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means that the `substr` method would start at the beginning of the string, while `null` would cause the method to return `null`.

DONE.
