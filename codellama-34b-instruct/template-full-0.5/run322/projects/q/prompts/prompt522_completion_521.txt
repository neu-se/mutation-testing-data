  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug.")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes the exception to the `deferred.reject` method, while this replacement code fragment throws a new error with the message "This is a bug."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("This is a different bug."))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes the exception to the `deferred.reject` method, while this replacement code fragment creates a new error with the message "This is a different bug." and passes it to the `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a third bug.")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes the exception to the `deferred.reject` method, while this replacement code fragment throws a new error with the message "This is a third bug."

DONE.
