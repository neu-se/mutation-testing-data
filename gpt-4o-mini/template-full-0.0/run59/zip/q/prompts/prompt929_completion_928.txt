Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the current context (`this`) to the end of the `args` array instead of adding it to the beginning, which changes the order of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `args` array, which alters the arguments being passed to the function and may lead to unexpected results if the first argument is essential.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by concatenating `this` to the `args` array without modifying the original `args`, which means the original arguments are not altered, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the function expects a modified argument list.

DONE.
