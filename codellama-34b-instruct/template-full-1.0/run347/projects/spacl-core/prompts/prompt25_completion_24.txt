  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the condition `min < 1` checks whether `min` is less than 1, but in this replacement, the condition `min < 2` checks whether `min` is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && !opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code fragment, the condition `opt` checks whether the `optional` variable is truthy, but in this replacement, the negation of `opt` checks whether `optional` is falsy. Additionally, the condition `min < 1` checks whether `min` is less than 1, but in this replacement, the condition `min < 2` checks whether `min` is less than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final || opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different
