  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which can be used to test the `query` method's behavior when the `rules` array is modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat([])
```
This code fragment creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `rules` array and an empty array, which can be used to test the `query` method's behavior when the `rules` array is modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(() => true)
```
This code fragment creates a new array that contains all the elements of the `rules` array, which can be used to test the `query` method's behavior when the `rules` array is modified.

DONE.
