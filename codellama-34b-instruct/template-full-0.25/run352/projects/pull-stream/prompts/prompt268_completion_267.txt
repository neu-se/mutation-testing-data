  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while the new code fragment `null` is a constant value that does not have a `call` method and cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a constant value that does not have a `call` method and cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while the new code fragment `function() {}` is a function that does not take any arguments and does not have any side effects, so it
