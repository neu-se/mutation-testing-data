  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that returns a new array, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `join` is a method that combines the elements of an array into a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element of an array, whereas `join` is a method that combines the elements of an array into a string.

DONE.
