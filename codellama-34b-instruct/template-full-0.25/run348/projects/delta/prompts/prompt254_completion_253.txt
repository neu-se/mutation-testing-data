  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one operation from the other iterator, even if it is not needed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume the entire remaining length of the other iterator, even if it is not needed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume a smaller amount of operations from the other iterator, depending on the length of the current operation.

DONE.
