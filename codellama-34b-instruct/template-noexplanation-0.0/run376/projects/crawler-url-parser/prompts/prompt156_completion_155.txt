  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it replaces the last occurrence of a forward slash with a space. This change will cause the `gettype` function to return a different result for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it replaces the last occurrence of a forward slash with a backslash. This change will cause the `gettype` function to return a different result for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\\\"
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it replaces the last occurrence of a forward slash with a double backslash. This change will cause the `gettype` function to return a different result for some inputs
