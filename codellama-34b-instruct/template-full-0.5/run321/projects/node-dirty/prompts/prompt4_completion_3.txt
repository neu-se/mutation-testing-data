  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` sets the value of a key to a specific value, whereas `delete` removes a specific key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` removes a specific key-value pair, whereas `set()` sets the value of a key to a specific value.

DONE.
