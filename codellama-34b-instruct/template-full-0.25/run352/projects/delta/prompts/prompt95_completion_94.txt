  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `ops` array, rather than inserting the new element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new element at the specified index, but it would not remove any existing elements from the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 1, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `ops` array, rather than inserting the new element at the specified index.

DONE.
