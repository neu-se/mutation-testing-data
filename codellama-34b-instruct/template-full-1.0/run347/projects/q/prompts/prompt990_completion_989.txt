  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++ arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `++` is a prefix increment operator, which increments the value of the variable by 1 before it is used. This change would result in a different value being passed to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `arguments` array to the `post` method, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string "object" to the `post` method, rather than the `arguments` array.

DONE.
