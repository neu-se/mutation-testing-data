  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOp = new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the `OpIterator` object, which would return the next operation in the sequence, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>` would be interpreted as a literal string, causing the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const baseOp = new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
