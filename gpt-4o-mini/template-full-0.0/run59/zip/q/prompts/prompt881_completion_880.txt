Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a resolver function would cause the promise to never resolve or reject, leading to a situation where the promise remains pending indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Forced error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because using a function that throws an error would immediately reject the promise with that error, rather than resolving it as intended, thus altering the flow of the promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "Unexpected value"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string instead of a function would cause the promise to resolve with a string value, which is not the expected behavior of resolving with the result of the original callback function.

DONE.
