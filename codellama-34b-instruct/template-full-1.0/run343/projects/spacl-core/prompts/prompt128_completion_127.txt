  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would now be false for the same `index` and `count` values, leading to a different outcome in the `for` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would now run for one iteration fewer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would now run for one iteration more.

DONE.
