  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to behave differently for the case where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to behave differently for the case where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 1. This change would cause the
