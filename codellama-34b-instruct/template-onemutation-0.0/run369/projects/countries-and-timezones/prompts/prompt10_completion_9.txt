  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of the expression, so if `result[country]` is truthy, the expression would evaluate to `false`, and if it is falsy, the expression would evaluate to `true`. In contrast, without the `!` operator, the expression would evaluate to `true` if `result[country]` is truthy, and `false` if it is falsy.

DONE.
