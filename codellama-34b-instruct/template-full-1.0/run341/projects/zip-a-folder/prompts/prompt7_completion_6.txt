  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```targetFilePath.slice(1)```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for a malicious path, but this new code would not detect a malicious path that starts with a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```targetFilePath.split('/')[0] + '/..'```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for a malicious path by comparing it to the source directory, but this new code would allow a malicious path to be created in a parent directory of the source directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```targetFilePath.split('/').reverse()[0]```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking for a malicious path by comparing it to the source directory, but this new code would allow a malicious path to be created in a sibling directory of the source directory.

DONE.
