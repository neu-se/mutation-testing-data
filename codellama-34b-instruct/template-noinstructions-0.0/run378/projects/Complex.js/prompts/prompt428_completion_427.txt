  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 instead of 0 when places is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1 instead of 0 when places is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a random number instead of 0 when places is undefined or null.

DONE.
