  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both the type of `op.retain` being a number or an object, while the new code fragment only checks for the type of `op.retain` being an object. This means that if `op.retain` is a number, the new code fragment will not consider it as a valid retain operation, while the original code fragment would.

DONE.
