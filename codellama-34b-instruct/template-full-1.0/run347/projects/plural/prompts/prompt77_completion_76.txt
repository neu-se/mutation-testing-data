  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice', 'strike'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "dice" is now matched by the regular expression `/[aeiouy]o$/i`, which is intended to match words that end in a consonant followed by "o", and will return "dice" + "s" = "dices", which is different from the correct plural form "dice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice', 'bite'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "dice" is now matched by the regular expression `/x$|ch$|s$/i`, which is intended to match words that end in "x", "ch", or "s", and will return "dice" + "es" = "dices", which is different from the correct plural form "dice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice', 'collie'
```
