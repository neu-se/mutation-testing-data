  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten if it already exists, whereas the original code used the default `flags` value of `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to if it already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'`, which means that the file will be written as a UTF-8 encoded file, whereas the original code used the default `encoding` value of `null`, which means that the file will be written as a binary file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { mode: 0o666 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode`
