  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` by itself references the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `args` array and any other arrays passed as arguments, whereas `args` by itself references the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter()` creates a new array that contains only the elements of the `args` array that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `args` by itself references the original array.

DONE.
