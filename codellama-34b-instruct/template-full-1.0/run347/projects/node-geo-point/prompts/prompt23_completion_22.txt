  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the `longitude` property rather than the `latitude` property, which could cause it to return incorrect results or throw errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, and the test case would not catch any errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking a non-existent property called `foo`, which could cause it to return incorrect results or throw errors.

DONE.
