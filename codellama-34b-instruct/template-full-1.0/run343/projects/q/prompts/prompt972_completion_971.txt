  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `args` is an Array, and the `apply` method is used to call the function with the elements of the array as arguments. However, if the code fragment is replaced with `name, [args]`, then the function will only be called with a single argument, which is an array containing the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function is called with two arguments, `name` and `args`. If the `name` argument is removed, the function will only be called with a single argument, which could cause an error if the function expects two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function is called with the `name` and `args` arguments. If the `name` argument is removed, the function will
