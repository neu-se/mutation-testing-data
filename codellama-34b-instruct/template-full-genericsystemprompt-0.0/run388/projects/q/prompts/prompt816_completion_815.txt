  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a different method than `done`, and it would not handle the promise's resolution in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { throw new Error("DONE"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error immediately after the promise is resolved, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () { return Q.reject("DONE"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the reason "DONE", rather than resolving it.

DONE.
