  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp[action])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `thisOp[action]` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called the `getHandler` method on the `thisOp` object with the `action` argument.
