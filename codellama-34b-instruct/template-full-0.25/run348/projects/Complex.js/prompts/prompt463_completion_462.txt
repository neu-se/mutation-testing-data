  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `<` instead of `<=` which would cause the `b` variable to be considered as zero even if it's slightly greater than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `<` instead of `>` which would cause the `b` variable to be considered as non-zero even if it's slightly less than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) == Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `<` instead of `==` which would cause the `b` variable to be considered as zero only if it's exactly equal to zero.

DONE.
