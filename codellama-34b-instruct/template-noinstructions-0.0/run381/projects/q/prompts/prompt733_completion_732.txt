  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the array of promises instead of the array of values, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
