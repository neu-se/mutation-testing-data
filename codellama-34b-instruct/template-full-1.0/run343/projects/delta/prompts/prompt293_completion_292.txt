  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete` would remove the entire line, whereas `line.push` would only append to the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would retain the text, whereas `line.push` would append to the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain` would retain the text, whereas `line.push` would append to the line.

DONE.
