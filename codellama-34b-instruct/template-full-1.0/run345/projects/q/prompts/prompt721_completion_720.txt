  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(promises)` would immediately reject the promise with the array of promises, whereas the original code `deferred.reject(rejection)` would reject the promise with a rejection value containing information about the first rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(promises)` would immediately resolve the promise with the array of promises, whereas the original code `deferred.resolve(promises
