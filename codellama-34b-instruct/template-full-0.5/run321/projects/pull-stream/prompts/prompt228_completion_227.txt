  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the result of the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would change the result of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `data` by 2, which would change the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
