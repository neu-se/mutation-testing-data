Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function from an asynchronous version (`_readFile`) to a synchronous version (`_readFileSync`), which could lead to blocking the event loop and different error handling behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Forced error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original file reading functionality with a function that always throws an error, bypassing the actual file reading and JSON parsing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFile.bind(null, 'nonexistent-file.json')
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `_readFile` function to always read from a non-existent file, which would consistently throw an error, regardless of the actual file being read.

DONE.
