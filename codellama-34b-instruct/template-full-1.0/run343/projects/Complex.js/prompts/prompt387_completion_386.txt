  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, but the original code fragment is `cosh`, which is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, but the original code fragment is `cos`, which is the cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acosh` is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, but the original code fragment is `cos`, which is the cosine function.

DONE.
