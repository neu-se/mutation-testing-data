  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will always reject the promise, whereas `when()` will resolve the promise if the input is a resolved promise, and reject it if the input is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will always resolve the promise, whereas `when()` will reject the promise if the input is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race()` will resolve the promise as soon as any of the input promises are resolved, whereas `when()` will only resolve the promise if all of the input promises are resolved.

DONE.
