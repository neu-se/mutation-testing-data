  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would throw an error when trying to retrieve a value from a closed queue, whereas the original code fragment would simply return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` when trying to retrieve a value from a closed queue, whereas the original code fragment would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return an error when trying to retrieve a value from a closed queue, whereas the original code fragment would throw an error.

DONE.
