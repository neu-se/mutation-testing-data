  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `timezones` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reduce((acc, tz) => acc + tz.name, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method returns a single value that is the result of combining the elements of the calling array using a provided function, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `
