  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise-like object, while this replacement checks if the value is an object of any type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise-like object, while this replacement checks if the value is an instance of the Array class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise-like object, while this replacement checks if the value has a `then` property.

DONE.
