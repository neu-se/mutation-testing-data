  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter value would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the query string, which could lead to incorrect results in the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter value would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the fragment, which could lead to incorrect results in the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter values would cause the `URL.parse` method to parse both the query string and the fragment, which could lead to incorrect results in the `extract` function.

DONE.
