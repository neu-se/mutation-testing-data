 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is replaced with a function that returns an empty object, which is not a Node.js-style resolver function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is replaced with `null`, which is not a valid argument for the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is replaced with `deferred.resolve`, which is a method that directly resolves the promise, bypassing the Node.js-style callback mechanism.

DONE.
