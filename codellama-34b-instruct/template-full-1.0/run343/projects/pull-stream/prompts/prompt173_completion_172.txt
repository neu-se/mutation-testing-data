  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !array.isarray
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `array` is an array or not using `Array.isArray()`, while the mutated code checks if `array.isArray` is not truthy. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `array` is an array-like object but not an instance of `Array`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `array` is falsy using `!array`, while the mutated code checks if `array` has a length of 0. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `array` is an empty array-like object but not strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array.filter(Boolean).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `array` has at least one element using `Array
