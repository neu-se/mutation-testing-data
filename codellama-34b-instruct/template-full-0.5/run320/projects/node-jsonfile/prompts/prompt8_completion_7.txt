  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `stripBom` to remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data, while this code replaces it with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `stripBom` to remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data, while this code removes the first character of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `stripBom` to remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data, while this code reverses the order of the characters in the data.

DONE.
