  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. If the length of the next operation is different from its type, the mutated code would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the current iterator. If the length of the next operation in the other iterator is different from its type, the mutated code would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the next operation in the current iterator
