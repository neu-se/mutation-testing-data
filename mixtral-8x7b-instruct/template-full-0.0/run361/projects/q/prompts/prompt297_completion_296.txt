 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would always reject the promise with an error "Q can't join: not the same: [object Object] null". The original code checks if `x` and `y` are the same, but with `null` as the replacement, the condition `x === y` would always be false, leading to a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would always reject the promise with an error "Q can't join: not the same: [object Object] [object Object]". By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `this`, the `join` method would compare the promise instance with itself, and the condition `x === y` would be false, leading to a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the
