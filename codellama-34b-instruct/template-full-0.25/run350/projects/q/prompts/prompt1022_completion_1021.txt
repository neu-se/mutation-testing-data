  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called on the object would change from "post" to "get".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument would be passed to the method being called on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional function argument would be passed to the method being called on the object.

DONE.
