  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the arctangent of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the arctangent of `-a`, which is the negative of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the arctangent of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the arctangent of `a + 1`, which is `a` plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the arctangent of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the arctangent of `a * 2`, which is `a` multiplied by 2.

DONE.
