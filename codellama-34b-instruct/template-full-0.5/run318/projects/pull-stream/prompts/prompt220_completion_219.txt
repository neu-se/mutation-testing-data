  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `undefined` is not. The original code fragment checks for `null` to determine if the source has already ended normally, but `undefined` would not be caught by this check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `null` is not. The original code fragment checks for `null` to determine if the source has already ended normally, but `0` would not be caught by this check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `null` is not. The original code fragment checks for `null` to determine if the source has already ended normally, but `false` would not be caught by this check.

DONE.
