  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new operation at the end of the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that concatenates two deltas, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the current operation, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the end of the delta.

DONE.
