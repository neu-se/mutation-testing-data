  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `X_OK` flag is not being checked, which allows execution of the target file even though it may not be intended to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `X_OK` flag is being checked in addition to the `R_OK` and `W_OK` flags, which may cause a permission error to be thrown if the target file does not have execution permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
