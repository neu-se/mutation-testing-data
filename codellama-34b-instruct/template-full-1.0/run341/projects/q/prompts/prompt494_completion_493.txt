  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `reason` is passed to `rejected` if it exists, which would result in a type error if `reason` is not callable. In this modified code, `null` would be passed to `rejected` instead, which would not result in a type error but would still indicate that the promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `reason` is passed to `rejected` if it exists, which would result in a type error if `reason` is not callable. In this modified code, `undefined` would be passed to `rejected` instead, which would not result in a type error but would still indicate that the promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because
