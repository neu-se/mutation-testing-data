  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
len = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, as the length of the array is now 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, potentially causing the loop to execute in reverse order.

DONE.
