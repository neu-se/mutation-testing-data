  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to always advance instead of stopping after the `yield`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to always throw an error instead of advancing or stopping.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to always return a value instead of advancing or throwing an error.

DONE.
