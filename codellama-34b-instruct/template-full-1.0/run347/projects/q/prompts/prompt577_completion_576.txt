  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"done"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "done" method of a promise is used to indicate that the asynchronous operation has completed, whereas "next" is used to indicate that the generator should resume execution at the next yield statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is used to indicate that an exception has occurred, whereas "next" is used to indicate that the generator should resume execution at the next yield statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"value"
```
This would result in different behavior because "value" is used to retrieve the value of a promise, whereas "next" is used to indicate that the generator should resume execution at the next yield statement.

DONE.
