 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code filters items based on their `field` value, while this modification filters items based on their `field` value converted to uppercase. This change may cause some items to be incorrectly filtered or pass through, depending on the case of their `field` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop('nonexistentProperty')(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `field` variable, which is a function derived from the `prop` function and the `field` argument. This modification replaces the `field` function with a function that always tries to access the `nonexistentProperty` of the input data, which would always return `undefined`. This change would cause all items to pass through the filter, regardless of the `invert` flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(Math.random())
