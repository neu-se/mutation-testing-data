  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an undefined value instead of being rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
