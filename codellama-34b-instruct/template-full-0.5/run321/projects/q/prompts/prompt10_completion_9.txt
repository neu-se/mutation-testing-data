  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {
    throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment defines a function and calls it, while this code fragment throws an error immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {
    console.log("This is a buggy code fragment");
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment defines a function and calls it, while this code fragment logs a message to the console and does not call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {
    return "This is a buggy code fragment";
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment defines a function and calls it, while this code fragment returns a string and does not call the function.

DONE.
