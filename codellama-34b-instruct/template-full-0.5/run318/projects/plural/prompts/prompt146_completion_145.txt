  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the first element of the `rules` array, which is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is the second element, which is a string or a function. By replacing `rule[1]` with `rule[0]`, the code would be using the regular expression as the replacement string, which would likely cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is a string or a function, and `rule[1][0]` would be the first character of that string or the result of calling that function with the word and the regular expression as arguments. This would likely cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is a string
