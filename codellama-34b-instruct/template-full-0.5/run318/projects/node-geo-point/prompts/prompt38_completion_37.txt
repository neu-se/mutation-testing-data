  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and `sin(x)` is not equivalent to `cos(x)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function that is not inverse to `cos`, and `tan(x)` is not equivalent to `cos(x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse of `cos`, and `acos(x)` is not equivalent to `cos(x)`.

DONE.
