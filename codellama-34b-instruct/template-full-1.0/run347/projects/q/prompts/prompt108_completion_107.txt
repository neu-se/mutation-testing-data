  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement instead of increment the counter, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i+=2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i-=2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would have a different behavior, the loop would work backwards and count up to zero.

DONE.
