Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of retaining the current operation, it pushes the next operation from `thisIter` into `delta`, which could lead to incorrect state changes in the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(transformedData + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `transformedData` by adding 1, which could cause an off-by-one error in the retention logic, potentially leading to data loss or incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(thisOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `thisOp.retain` directly instead of the transformed data, which may not account for the necessary transformations and could lead to incorrect retention of operations.

DONE.
