  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with an error, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, rather than the `close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => { throw new Error('Intentional error'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `end` method to be called with a callback that throws an error, rather than the `close` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'), () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with an error and a callback, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, rather than the `close` event.

DONE.
