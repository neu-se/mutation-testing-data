  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[0] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the array `a` is empty, and if it is, it is exiting the program. However, this new code fragment is assigning the value of 0 to the first element of the array `a`, which may cause the program to behave differently if the array `a` is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the variable `a` is undefined or null, and if it is, it is exiting the program. However, this new code fragment is assigning an empty array to the variable `a`, which may cause the program to behave differently if the variable `a` is not undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
numerOfItems = a.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the variable `a
