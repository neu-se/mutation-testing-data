  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array. Using `array_slice.reverse()` would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.pop()` is a method that removes the last element from an array. Using `array_slice.pop()` would cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of
