  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ComplexPlusZero
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `isZero` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ComplexTimesOne
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `toVector` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ComplexWithNegativeImaginaryPart
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `isInfinite` method.

DONE.
