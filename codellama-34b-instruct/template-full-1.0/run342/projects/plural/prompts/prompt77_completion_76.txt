  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'die' word is not matched by the code fragment and therefore the plural form of 'die' would not be 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dye', 'dye'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'dye' word is not matched by the code fragment and therefore the plural form of 'dye' would not be 'dye'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dye'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'die' word is not matched by the code fragment and therefore the plural form of 'die' would not be 'dye'.

DONE.
