  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches files in the current directory, while the modified code fragment matches files in any subdirectory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '[!.]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches files with a dot in the filename, while the modified code fragment matches files without a dot in the filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches files with a single dot in the filename, while the modified code fragment matches files with any number of dots in the filename.

DONE.
