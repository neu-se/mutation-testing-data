  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially causing the tests to fail.

DONE.
