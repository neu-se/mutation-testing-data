  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the `predicate` function to a function that takes two arguments, `op` and `index`, and returns a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op) => boolean
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the `predicate` function to a function that takes a single argument, `op`, and returns a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op) => number
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the `predicate` function to a function that takes a single argument, `op`, and returns a number value.

DONE.
