 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation to use the squared imaginary part instead of the real part, potentially leading to incorrect results for complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a, 2) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the square of the real part, which may have slightly different floating-point behavior compared to the original `a * a` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (a * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the expression, which would lead to incorrect results for cases where the original expression should evaluate to zero or negative values.

DONE.
