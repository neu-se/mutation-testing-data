  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(null, "set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the `dispatch` method, whereas the original code passes `this` explicitly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null, "set", key, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` value to the `dispatch` method, while also changing the order of the parameters to `dispatch`.

DONE.
