Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

var tester = require('../util/tester')
var filter = require('./filter')

module.exports = function filterNot (test) {
  test = tester(<PLACEHOLDER>)
  return filter(function (data) { return !test(data) })
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
test
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
