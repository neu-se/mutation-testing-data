  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with an argument of `true`, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with an argument of `false`, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with an argument of `null`, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code fragment.

DONE.
