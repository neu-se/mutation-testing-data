  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will concatenate the string 'foo' to the end of the src variable, which will likely cause the code to fail because the resulting path will not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This code fragment will remove the first character of the src variable, which will likely cause the code to fail because the resulting path will not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('/')[0]
```
This code fragment will split the src variable on the '/' character and return the first element of the resulting array, which will likely cause the code to fail because the resulting path will not exist.

DONE.
