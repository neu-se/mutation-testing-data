  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, whereas `iter.hasNext` is a property that returns the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` is a function call that returns the next element in the iteration, whereas `iter.hasNext` is a property that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` is a function call that returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `iter.hasNext` is a property that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements.

DONE.
