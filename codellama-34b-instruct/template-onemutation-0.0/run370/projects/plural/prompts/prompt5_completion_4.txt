  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call` is a function that returns the string representation of an object, while `Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)` is a bound function that returns the string representation of the `Object.prototype.toString` object, which is not the same as the original object.

DONE.
