  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to miss the last character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only consider the first half of the string.

DONE.
