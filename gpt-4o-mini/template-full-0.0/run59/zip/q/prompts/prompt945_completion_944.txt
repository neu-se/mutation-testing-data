Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the end, which could change the order of arguments passed to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` instead of the resolver, which means the callback will not receive a valid resolver function, potentially leading to errors when the callback is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the reject function instead of the resolver, which would cause the callback to be invoked with an error instead of resolving the promise correctly.

DONE.
