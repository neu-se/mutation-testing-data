  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called with `null` as the second argument if `ended` is true, but this replacement code fragment would always call `cb` with `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called with `err` as the first argument if `ended` is true, but this replacement code fragment would always call `cb` with `err` as the first argument, regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called with `data` as the second argument if `ended` is true, but this replacement code fragment would always call `
