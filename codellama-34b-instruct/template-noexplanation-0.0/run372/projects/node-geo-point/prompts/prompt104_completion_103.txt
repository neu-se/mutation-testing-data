  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This will cause the x coordinate to be rounded up to the nearest integer, which may result in a different tile being selected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This will cause the x coordinate to be rounded to the nearest integer, which may result in a different tile being selected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This will cause the x coordinate to be rounded down to the nearest integer, which may result in a different tile being selected.

DONE.
