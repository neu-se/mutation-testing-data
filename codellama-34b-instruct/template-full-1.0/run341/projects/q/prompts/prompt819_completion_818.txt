  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because, when a promise is rejected, the `done` method will call the `onUnhandledError` callback without waiting for the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because, if the random number is less than 0.5, the `done` method will call the `onUnhandledError` callback without waiting for the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Random error')
```
This would result in different behavior because, the `done` method will call the `onUnhandledError` callback without waiting for the next tick and will throw a new random error.

DONE.
