  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, as the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `Math.sqrt` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, as the `* 2` would double the result of the `Math.sqrt` function.

DONE.
