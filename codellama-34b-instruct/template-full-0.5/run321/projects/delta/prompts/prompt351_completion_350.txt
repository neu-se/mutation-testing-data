  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation, rather than the base operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the base operation, rather than its attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other operation, rather than its attributes.

DONE.
