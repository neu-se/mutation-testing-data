  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `end`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, resulting in a different code path being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a distinct value from `end`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, resulting in a different code path being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a distinct value from `end`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, resulting in a different code path being executed.

DONE.
