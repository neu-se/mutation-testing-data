  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points in the opposite direction, which would result in a different bearing and distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude - point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the two points in the opposite direction, which would result in a different bearing and distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the two coordinates, which would result in a different bearing and distance calculation.

DONE.
