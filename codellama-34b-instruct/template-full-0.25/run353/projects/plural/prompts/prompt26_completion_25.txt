  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` would return the first character of the string, while the new code fragment `1` would return the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` would return the first character of the string, while the new code fragment `-1` would return the last character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello".length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` would return the first character of the string, while the new code fragment `"hello".length` would return the length of the string.

DONE.
