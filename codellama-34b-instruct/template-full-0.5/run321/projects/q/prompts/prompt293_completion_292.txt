  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues with the function's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, deferred.resolve, deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues with the function's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.notify, deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues with the function's logic.

DONE.
