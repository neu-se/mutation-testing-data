  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `d` is not equal to 0, which would result in a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `d` is greater than 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `d` is greater than 0, which would result in a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this
