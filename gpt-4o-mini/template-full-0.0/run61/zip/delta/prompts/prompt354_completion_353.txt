Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inverted;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `inverted` Delta without chopping it, potentially leaving trailing empty operations that should have been removed, which could lead to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inverted.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would chop the `inverted` Delta by 1, which may remove a valid operation that should be retained, altering the expected output of the `invert` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inverted.chop(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a negative value to `chop` could lead to an unexpected behavior, such as not modifying the `inverted` Delta at all, which would return the original Delta instead of the intended inverted version.

DONE.
