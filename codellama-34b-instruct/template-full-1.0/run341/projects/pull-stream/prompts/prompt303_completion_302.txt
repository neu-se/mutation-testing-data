  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a boolean value instead of the original `ended` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
ended || end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a boolean value that is the opposite of the original `ended` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a boolean value that is the opposite of the original `ended` variable.

DONE.
