  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth element of the `ref` array is different from the third element, which could cause the `pull` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the `ref` array is different from the original code fragment, which could cause the `pull` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[2], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the `ref` array is different from the original code fragment, which could cause the `pull` function to behave differently.

DONE.
