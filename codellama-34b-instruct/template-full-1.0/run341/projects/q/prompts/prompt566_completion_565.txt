  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because "reject" is a function that would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas "when" is a function that would cause the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is a function that would cause the promise to resolve, whereas "when" is a function that would cause the promise to resolve or reject based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
join
```
This would result in different behavior because "join" is a function that would cause the input promises to be joined into a new promise, whereas "when" is a function that would cause the input promises to be resolved or rejected based on the input.

DONE.
