  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor.index
```
This would result in different behavior because `cursor.index` is a number, while `cursor` is an object with properties such as `line` and `ch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor.line
```
This would result in different behavior because `cursor.line` is a number, while `cursor` is an object with properties such as `line` and `ch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor.ch
```
This would result in different behavior because `cursor.ch` is a number, while `cursor` is an object with properties such as `line` and `ch`.

DONE.
