  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this == Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `this` is an instance of `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor == Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `this` is an instance of `Complex` and not if it's an instance of a subclass of `Complex`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `this` is an instance of `Complex` or any of its subclasses.

DONE.
