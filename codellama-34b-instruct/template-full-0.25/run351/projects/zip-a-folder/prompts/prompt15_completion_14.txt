  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` is the constant for write permission, while `fs.constants.R_OK` is the constant for read permission. Using `fs.constants.W_OK` would cause the code to check if the source file has write permission instead of read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.X_OK` is the constant for execute permission. Using `fs.constants.X_OK` would cause the code to check if the source file has execute permission instead of read permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.F_OK` is the constant for existence of the file. Using `
