  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with a null argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with an undefined argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(this.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with the name of the current policy, which would cause an error.

DONE.
