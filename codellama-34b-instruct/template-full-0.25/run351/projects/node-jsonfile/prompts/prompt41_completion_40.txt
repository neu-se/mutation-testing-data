  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function is not the same as the `writeFile` function. The `writeFileSync` function writes the file synchronously, while the `writeFile` function writes the file asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileAsync` function is not the same as the `writeFile` function. The `writeFileAsync` function writes the file asynchronously, while the `writeFile` function writes the file synchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFile` function is not the same as the `writeFile` function. The `writeFile` function writes the file synchronously, while the `writeFile` function writes the file asynchronously.

DONE.
