  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a different value than `b`, and may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `b`, and may not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
