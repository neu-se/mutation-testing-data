  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `end` was truthy, but replacing it with `null` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `end` was truthy, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `end` was truthy, but replacing it with `true` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
