  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` expression is replaced with `Math.pow(9, places || 0)`, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` expression is replaced with `Math.pow(0, places || 0)`, which always returns 0, regardless of the value of `places`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` expression is replaced with `Math.pow(Infinity, places || 0)`, which always returns Infinity, regardless of the value of `places`.

DONE.
