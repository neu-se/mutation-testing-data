  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `undefined` is not. If the code is expecting a value to be `undefined`, it may not handle `null` correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'undefined'` is a string, and it will not be treated as a special value in the same way that `undefined` is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to explicitly get the value `undefined` in JavaScript. It is not the same as `undefined`, but it may be treated differently in certain contexts.

DONE.
