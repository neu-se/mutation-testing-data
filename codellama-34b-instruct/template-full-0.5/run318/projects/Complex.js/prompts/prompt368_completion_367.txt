  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is different from the `b` variable used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression is different from the `b` variable used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * b` expression is different from the `b` variable used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
