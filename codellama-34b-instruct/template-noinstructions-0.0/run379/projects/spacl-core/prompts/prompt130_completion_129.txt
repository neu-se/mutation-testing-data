  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the code to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last iteration, potentially causing the code to miss an important check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index > count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the code to miss an important check.

DONE.
