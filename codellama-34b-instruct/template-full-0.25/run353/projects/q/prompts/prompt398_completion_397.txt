  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `thenResolve` method would be called with `null` as the resolution value, which would result in a rejected promise with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `thenResolve` method would be called with `undefined` as the resolution value, which would result in a rejected promise with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a truthy value, so the `thenResolve` method would be called with `"foo"` as the resolution value, which would result in a fulfilled promise with the value `"foo"`.

DONE.
