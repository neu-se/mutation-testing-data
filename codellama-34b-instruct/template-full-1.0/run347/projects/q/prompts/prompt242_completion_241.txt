  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would be called with a different argument, which could return a different promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false`, and the `reject` function would be called with `null` instead of the original `reason`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `true` for a rejected promise, and the `reject` function would be called with a new error instead of the original `reason`.

DONE.
