  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not defined on the `this` object, which is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () {
    deferred.reject();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `this` object, which is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(function () {
    deferred.reject();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `this` object, which is a promise.

DONE.
