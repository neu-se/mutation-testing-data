  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that writes the file to disk immediately, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise that resolves when the file is written to disk. Using `fs.writeFileSync` in the `_writeFile` function would cause the function to block until the file is written, which could lead to performance issues and deadlocks.
