  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolver` variable is not equal to the string "function", rather than checking if it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolver` variable is not an object, rather than checking if it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolver` variable's constructor is not the `Function` constructor, rather than checking if it is not a function.

DONE.
