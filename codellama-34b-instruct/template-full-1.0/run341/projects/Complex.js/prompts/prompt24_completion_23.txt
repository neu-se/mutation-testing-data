  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` has a different function than `Math.sqrt`. Instead of dividing by the length, `Math.cosh` would add to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` has a different function than `Math.sqrt`. Instead of dividing by the length, `Math.tan` would multiply it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` has a different function than `Math.sqrt`. Instead of dividing by the length, `Math.sinh` would subtract it.

DONE.
