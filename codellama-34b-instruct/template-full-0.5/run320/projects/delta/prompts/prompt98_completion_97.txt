  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `newOp` object is set to 0, which means that the `delete` operation will not be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is set to `null`, which means that the `insert` operation will not be performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `newOp` object is set to 0, which means that the `retain` operation will not be performed.

DONE.
