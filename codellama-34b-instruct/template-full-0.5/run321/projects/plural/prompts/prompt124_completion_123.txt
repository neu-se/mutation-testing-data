  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, even if it doesn't need to be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 'es' to the end of the word, even if it doesn't need to be pluralized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 'ies' to the end of the word, even if it doesn't need to be pluralized.

DONE.
