  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.pathname` is a different property than `linkurl.path`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.search` is a different property than `linkurl.path`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.hash` is a different property than `linkurl.path`, which is used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
