  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the promise chain to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which could cause the promise chain to continue but not complete successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code, which could cause the promise chain to continue but not complete successfully.

DONE.
