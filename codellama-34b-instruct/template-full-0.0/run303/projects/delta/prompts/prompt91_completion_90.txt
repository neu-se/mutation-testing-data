  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is an object with a `null` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is an object with an `undefined` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an empty object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is
