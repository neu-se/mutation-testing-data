  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different method than "post" and would cause a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
