  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getlevel
```
This would result in different behavior because `getlevel` is a different function than `gettype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getlink
```
This would result in different behavior because `getlink` is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(not a function call)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would no longer be a function call.

DONE.
