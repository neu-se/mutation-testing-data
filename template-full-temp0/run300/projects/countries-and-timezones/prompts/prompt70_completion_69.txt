  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause it to return `null` instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a timezone object that is already in the `timezones` object, which would cause it to return the same object instead of a new one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name].name);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a string argument (the name of the timezone) instead of a timezone object, which would cause it to return a new timezone object with the same name instead of the expected timezone object
