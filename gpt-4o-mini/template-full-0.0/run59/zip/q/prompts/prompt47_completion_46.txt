Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it will execute the `domain.exit()` only if `domain` is falsy, which is the opposite of the original logic that executes it when `domain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call `domain.exit()` if `domain` is explicitly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined`, which would prevent the exit from being called in more cases than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will call `domain.exit()` when `domain` is defined, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `domain` is an object that should not trigger the exit, unlike the original check that allows for more flexibility with truthy values.

DONE.
