  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `otherOp.retain` is not `null`, even if `thisOp.retain` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `thisOp.retain` is `null`, even if `otherOp.retain` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `otherOp.retain` is a number, even if `thisOp.retain` is `null`.

DONE.
