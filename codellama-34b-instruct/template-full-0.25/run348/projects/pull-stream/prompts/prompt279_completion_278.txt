  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is undefined, whereas `prop` is a function that returns a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` is a different value than `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.bar` is undefined, whereas `prop` is a function that returns a value.

DONE.
