  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex pattern matches a different set of words. The original pattern matches words that end with a vowel followed by "o", while the new pattern matches words that end with a consonant followed by "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
