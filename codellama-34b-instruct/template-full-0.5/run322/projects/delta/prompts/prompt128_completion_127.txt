  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because `start + index` would result in a different value than `start - index`, which could potentially cause the `while` loop to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because `start * index` would result in a different value than `start - index`, which could potentially cause the `while` loop to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / index
```
This would result in different behavior because `start / index` would result in a different value than `start - index`, which could potentially cause the `while` loop to execute differently.

DONE.
