  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx !== undefined` is a different expression than `ctx`, which could lead to a different result when evaluating the `matches` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ctx !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof ctx !== 'undefined'` is a different expression than `ctx !== undefined`, which could lead to a different result when evaluating the `matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx === null` is a different expression than `ctx !== undefined`, which could lead to a different result when evaluating the `matches` method.

DONE.
