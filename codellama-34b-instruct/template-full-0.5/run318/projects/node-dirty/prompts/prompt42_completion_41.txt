  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `val` before passing it to the `updater` function, which could cause the update to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `updater` function, which could cause the update to fail or behave differently from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `updater` function, which could cause the update to fail or behave differently from the original code.

DONE.
