  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the positive value of `b`, while this replacement uses the negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` without any modification, while this replacement multiplies `b` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` without any modification, while this replacement adds 1 to `b`.

DONE.
