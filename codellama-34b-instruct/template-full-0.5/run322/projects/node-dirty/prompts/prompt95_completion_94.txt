  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(':')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only parse the value part of the row, rather than the entire row.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(',')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only parse the second value in the row, rather than the entire row.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.replace('key', 'value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the key with the value, rather than parsing the entire row.

DONE.
