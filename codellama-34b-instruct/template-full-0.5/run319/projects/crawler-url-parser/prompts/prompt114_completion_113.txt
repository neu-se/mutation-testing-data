  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = urlMap.values()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first value in the `urlMap` values, rather than all values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = urlMap.keys()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first key in the `urlMap` keys, rather than all values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = urlMap.get(urlMap.keys()[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first key in the `urlMap` keys, rather than all values.

DONE.
