  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string", options
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `countryId` as a positional argument, while this change passes a string literal as a positional argument, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `countryId` as a positional argument, while this change passes a number as a positional argument, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `countryId` as a positional argument, while this change passes `null` as a positional argument, which would likely cause a null pointer exception.

DONE.
