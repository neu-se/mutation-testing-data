  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also checks for the `!this._waitForDrain` condition, which is not present in this option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also checks for the `this._inFlightWrites <= 0` condition, which is not present in this option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also checks for the `this._inFlightWrites <= 0` condition, which is not present in this option.

DONE.
