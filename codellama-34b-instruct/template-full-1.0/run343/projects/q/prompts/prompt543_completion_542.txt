  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `void 0` is used to specify an empty array, but `null` would not produce the same result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `array` is used to specify an empty array, but `[]` would not produce the same result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `void 0` is used to specify an undefined value, but `"undefined"` would not produce the same result.

DONE.
