  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a fulfilled or rejected callback, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a fulfilled or rejected callback, and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Promise was rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error, and the `catch` method would be called with the error as an argument.

DONE.
