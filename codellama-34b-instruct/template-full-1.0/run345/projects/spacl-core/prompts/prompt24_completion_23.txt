  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 1 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max > 1` condition would only be true if `max` is greater than 1, whereas the original code fragment would be true if `max` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max === 1 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max === 1` condition would only be true if `max` is equal to 1, whereas the original code fragment would be true if `max` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any && max > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any && max > 0` condition would only be true if `any` is true and `max` is greater than 0, whereas the original code fragment would be true if `max` is greater than 0 or `any` is true.

DONE.
