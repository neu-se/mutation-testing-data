 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source.push(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the data into the source object, which is likely not the intended behavior. The original code passes the data to the sink, not the source.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source.write(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it writes the data to the source object, which is likely not the intended behavior. The original code passes the data to the sink, not the source.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source.emit('data', data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'data' event on the source object, which is likely not the intended behavior. The original code passes the data to the sink, not the source.

These changes would result in different behavior because they modify the data flow in the function, causing the data to be processed differently than in the original code. DONE.
