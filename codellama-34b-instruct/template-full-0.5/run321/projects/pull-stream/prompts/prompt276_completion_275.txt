  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` would be called unconditionally, which would cause the stream to advance to the next stream without checking for the end of the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` would be called unconditionally, which would cause the stream to advance to the next chunk without checking for the end of the current chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream(true)` would be called unconditionally, which would cause the stream to advance to the next stream and ignore the current stream, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

DONE.
