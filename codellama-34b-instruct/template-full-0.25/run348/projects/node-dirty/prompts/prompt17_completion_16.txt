  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the key to be incremented by 1, which would result in a different key being used for the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the key to be doubled, which would result in a different key being used for the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the key to be decremented by 1, which would result in a different key being used for the cache.

DONE.
