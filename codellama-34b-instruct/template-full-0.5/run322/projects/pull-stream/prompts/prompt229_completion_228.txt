  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data)` is a different function call than `test(data)`, and it may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data) === true` is a different condition than `!test(data)`, and it may evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `test(data) && true` is a different condition than `!test(data)`, and it may evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
