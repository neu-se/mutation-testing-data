  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would flip the direction of the complex number's imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the imaginary part of the complex number, which could change its magnitude and even its sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b/2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the imaginary part of the complex number, which could change its magnitude and even its sign.

DONE.
