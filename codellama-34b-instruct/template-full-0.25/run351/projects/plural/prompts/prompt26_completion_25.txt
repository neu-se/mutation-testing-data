  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to get the first character of the word, while `1` would get the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to get the first character of the word, while `-1` would get the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello".length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to get the first character of the word, while `"hello".length` would get the length of the word.

DONE.
