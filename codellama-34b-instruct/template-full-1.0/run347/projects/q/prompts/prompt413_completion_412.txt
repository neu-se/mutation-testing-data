  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof <PLACEHOLDER> === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the expression, and `undefined` is a type that can be used in a comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is the strict equality comparison operator, which checks not only the value but also the type of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isObject(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isObject()` is a boolean function that checks if the expression is an object or not, and the `!` operator converts the result to its opposite.

DONE.
