Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume('data');
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to resume the response stream with a string argument, which is not valid. This could lead to unexpected errors or behavior, as the `resume` method does not accept any parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
console.log('Response data consumed');
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a console log statement after resuming the response data. While it does not change the flow of the program, it introduces side effects that could lead to confusion in understanding the program's execution without affecting the error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
reject(new Error('Request Failed with status code: ' + res.statusCode));
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message format, potentially leading to confusion when debugging. The new message concatenates the status code differently, which may not be as clear as the original message.

DONE.
