  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the string "test" to the href attribute, which would cause the URL to be modified and potentially point to a different resource.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + $(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it duplicates the href attribute, which would cause the URL to be repeated and potentially point to a different resource.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + '?' + $(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a query string to the href attribute, which would cause the URL to be modified and potentially point to a different resource.

DONE.
