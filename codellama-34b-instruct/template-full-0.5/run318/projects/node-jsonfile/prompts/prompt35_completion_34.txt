  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, even if the `fs.writeFileSync` method throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, even if the `fs.writeFileSync` method throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, even if the `fs.writeFileSync` method throws an error.

DONE.
