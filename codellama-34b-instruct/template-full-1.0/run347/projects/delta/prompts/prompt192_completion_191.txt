  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the other iterator, while `!otherIter.hasNext()` would return false if there is a next operation in the other iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp != delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp != delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]` would compare the new operation to the last operation in the delta, while `!otherIter.hasNext() && isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)` would compare the new operation to the last operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `
