  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs` is an object with string keys, and `verbs[0]` would be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys, and `for (const verb of verbs)` would iterate over the array of keys, not the object's values as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values, and `for (const verb of verbs)` would iterate over the array of values, not the object's keys as intended.

DONE.
