  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tests the `end` variable, but the new code fragment always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tests the `end` variable, but the new code fragment always returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment tests the `end` variable, but the new code fragment always returns `undefined`.

DONE.
