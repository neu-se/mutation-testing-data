  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` and `arguments`, which refer to the current execution context and the arguments passed to the function, respectively. Replacing them with `null` would cause the function to receive `null` as its `this` value and no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` and `arguments`, which refer to the current execution context and the arguments passed to the function, respectively. Replacing them with `undefined` would cause the function to receive `undefined` as its `this` value and no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` and `arguments`, which refer to the current execution context and the arguments passed to the function, respectively
