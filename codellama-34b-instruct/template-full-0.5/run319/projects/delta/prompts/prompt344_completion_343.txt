  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = 'image';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `embedType` variable, which is defined in the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function and is the key of the `op.retain` object. By replacing it with a hardcoded value of `'image'`, the code would always assume that the embed type is `'image'`, which may not be the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = op.retain[Object.keys(op.retain)[0]];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.keys` method to get the key of the `op.retain` object, which may not be the same as the hardcoded value of `'image'`. By using the `Object.keys` method, the code would get the actual key of the `op.retain` object, which may be different from the hardcoded value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
