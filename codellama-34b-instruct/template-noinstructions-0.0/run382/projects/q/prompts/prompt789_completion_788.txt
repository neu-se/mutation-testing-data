  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `onUnhandledError` error, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(onUnhandledError, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `onUnhandledError` error, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined`, even if the promise was rejected.

DONE.
