  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the argument of the sine function, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of pi would change the argument of the sine function, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of pi would change the argument of the sine function, resulting in a different complex number.

DONE.
