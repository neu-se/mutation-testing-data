  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move one step further than it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move one step backward than it should, potentially missing important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move twice as far as it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
