  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a global search and replace, rather than just the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a case-insensitive search, which would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a multi-line search, which would allow the regex to match across multiple lines.

DONE.
