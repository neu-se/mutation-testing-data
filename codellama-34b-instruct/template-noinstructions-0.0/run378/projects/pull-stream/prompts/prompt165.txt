Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'
var abortCb = require('../util/abort-cb')

module.exports = function values (array, onAbort) {
  if(!array)
    return function (abort, cb) {
      if(abort) return <PLACEHOLDER>(cb, abort, onAbort)
      return cb(true)
    }
  if(!Array.isArray(array))
    array = Object.keys(array).map(function (k) {
      return array[k]
    })
  var i = 0
  return function (abort, cb) {
    if(abort)
      return abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
    if(i >= array.length)
      cb(true)
    else
      cb(null, array[i++])
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
abortCb
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
