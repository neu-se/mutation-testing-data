  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a callback function that is expected to be called with a progress update, but replacing it with `null` would cause the progress update to be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a callback function that is expected to be called with a progress update, but replacing it with an empty arrow function would cause the progress update to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(update) => { throw update; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a callback function that is expected to be called with a progress update, but replacing it with a function that throws an error when called with a progress update would cause the promise to be rejected with the progress update as the reason.

DONE.
