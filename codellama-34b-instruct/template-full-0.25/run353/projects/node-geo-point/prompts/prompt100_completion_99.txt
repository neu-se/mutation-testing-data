  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 180 would shift the result by 180 degrees, which would cause the `calculateDestination` function to return an incorrect destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but subtracting 180 would shift the result by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which would also cause the `calculateDestination` function to return an incorrect destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but multiplying by 2 would double the result, which
