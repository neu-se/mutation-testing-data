  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `map` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `map` is null. If `map` is undefined or an empty object, the original code would still execute the `map` function, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `map` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `map` is an empty array. If `map` is an empty object or a non-empty array, the original code would still execute the `map` function, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `map` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `map` is an
