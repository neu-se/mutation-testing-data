  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an array can never be less than zero, so the code would always return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because if the length of the promises array is one, the code would always return a resolved promise with the value of the only promise in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because if the length of the promises array is greater than or equal to two, the code would always return a resolved promise with the value of the first promise in the array, ignoring any other promises in the array.

DONE.
