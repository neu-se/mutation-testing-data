  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `-Math.abs` would return the negative absolute value. This could cause issues in the `getOffsetStr` function, where the offset is used to calculate the sign of the offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, while `offset / 60` would return the result of dividing `offset` by 60. This could cause issues in the `getOffsetStr` function, where the offset is used to calculate the hours and minutes of the offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset % 60` would return the remainder of dividing `offset` by
