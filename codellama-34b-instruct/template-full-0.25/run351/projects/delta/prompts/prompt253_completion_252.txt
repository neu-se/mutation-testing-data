  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be increased by 1, which could cause the algorithm to skip over a portion of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decreased by 1, which could cause the algorithm to include an extra character in the output string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which could cause the algorithm to include extra characters in the output string.

DONE.
