  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would always return null, whereas the original code would return the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would always return undefined, whereas the original code would return the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would always return the number 42, whereas the original code would return the original object.

DONE.
