  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range and output than the `cos` function, which could cause the `calculateBearing` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 / cos` expression would return a different value than the `cos` function, which could cause the `calculateBearing` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2 - cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI / 2 - cos` expression would return a different value than the `cos` function, which could cause the `calculateBearing` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
