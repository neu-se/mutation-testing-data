  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an element with the ID "base", while the new code fragment is looking for an element with the ID "basea".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an element with the ID "base", while the new code fragment is looking for an element with the ID "baseb".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for an element with the ID "base", while the new code fragment is looking for an element with the ID "basec".

DONE.
