  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `abortCb` with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `abortCb` with the wrong arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `abortCb` with the wrong arguments, which would cause an error.

DONE.
