  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `abort` and `end` are truthy, and if so, it returns the value of `end`. If `abort` is falsy, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `end` or `abort` is truthy, and if so, it returns the value of `end`. If `end` is falsy, the `
