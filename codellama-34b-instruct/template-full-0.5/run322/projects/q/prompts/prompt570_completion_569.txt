  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if the arguments are not used correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is the same as the original code, which would not cause any differences in behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` argument is missing, which could cause the function to behave differently if the `callback` argument is used.

DONE.
