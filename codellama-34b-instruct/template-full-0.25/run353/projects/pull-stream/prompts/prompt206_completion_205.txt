  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `aborted` is `false`, and `false` when `aborted` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `aborted` is `true`, and `true` when `aborted` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `aborted` is `false`, and `false` when `aborted` is `true`.

DONE.
