  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `test` variable, causing the `filter` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would short-circuit the expression and return `false` if `test` is truthy, causing the `filter` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would short-circuit the expression and return `true` if `test` is falsy, causing the `filter` function to behave differently.

DONE.
