  Here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * b` is always positive, while `b` itself may be negative or positive depending on the value of `a`. This could cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because `c * d` is always positive, while `a` and `b` may be positive or negative depending on the values of the inputs. This could cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is always positive, while `b` may be positive or negative depending on the value of the input. This could cause the function to return a different value for the same input.

DONE.
