 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it breaks the encapsulation of the `Q` object by using the `dispatch` method from the Object prototype, which may not have the same behavior as the original `Q(object).dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.apply` is not the same as `Q(object).dispatch`. The `dispatch` method is likely to have specific behavior related to the `Q` promise implementation, while `Q.apply` is a different method with potentially different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` may not refer to the correct `dispatch` method in the context of the function. The `Q(object)` ensures that the correct `dispatch` method is called, while `this.dispatch` may refer to
