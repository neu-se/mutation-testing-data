  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire baseOp, rather than just the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp), { newline: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire baseOp, but with the newline attribute set to false, which would cause the newline to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp), { newline: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire baseOp, but with the newline attribute set to true, which would cause the newline to be included in the output.

DONE.
