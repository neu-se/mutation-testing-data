 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function is case-sensitive and converting the currentUrlStr to uppercase may result in incorrect parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because removing the last character of the currentUrlStr may result in an incomplete or incorrect URL, leading to incorrect parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr + '?'
