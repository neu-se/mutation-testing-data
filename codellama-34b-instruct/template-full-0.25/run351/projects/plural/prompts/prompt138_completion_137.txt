  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the rule's match pattern to the word, rather than the rule's replacement pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether the rule's match pattern matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 'es' to the end of the word, regardless of whether the rule's match pattern matches.

DONE.
