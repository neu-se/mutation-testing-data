  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while the new code checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`. In JavaScript, `undefined` is a falsy value, but other falsy values such as `null`, `0`, or `''` would pass the check in the original code but not in the new code.
