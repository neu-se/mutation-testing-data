  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `currentUrlStr` string to lowercase, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http` or `https` protocol from the beginning of the `currentUrlStr` string, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `currentUrlStr` string into an array of substrings, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
