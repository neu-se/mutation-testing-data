  Great! Let's get started with the first option.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` function is designed to wrap a Node.js-style callback-based function with a promise-based interface. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `readFile` function to return a promise that never resolves, leading to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

For example, if the calling code was expecting a JSON object to be returned from `readFile`, it would instead receive a promise that never resolves, leading to a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would also result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` function is designed to wrap a Node.js-style callback-based function with a promise-based interface. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `readFile` function to return a promise that immediately resolves with a value of `null`, which would likely cause unexpected behavior in the
