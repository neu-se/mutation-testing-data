  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `abortCb` function is `null`, whereas in the original code it is `abort`. This change would cause the `abortCb` function to always return `null`, regardless of whether an abort signal is received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `abortCb` function is `null`, whereas in the original code it is `onAbort`. This change would cause the `abortCb` function to always return `null`, regardless of whether an abort signal is received.
