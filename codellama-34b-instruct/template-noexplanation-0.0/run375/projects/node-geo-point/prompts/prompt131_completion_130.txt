  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return a tile with a zoom level that is one level higher than the original zoom level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return a tile with a zoom level that is one level lower than the original zoom level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This change will cause the `toTile` method to return a tile with a zoom level that is twice the original zoom level.

DONE.
