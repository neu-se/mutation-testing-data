  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now attempt to mutate the delete attribute, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now attempt to mutate a different operator's retain attribute, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now attempt to mutate the retain attribute of the newOp, which is not intended.

DONE.
