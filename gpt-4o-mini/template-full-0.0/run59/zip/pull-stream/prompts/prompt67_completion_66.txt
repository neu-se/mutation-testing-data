Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will evaluate to true if `end` is falsy (like `null` or `undefined`), allowing the code to proceed to the warning and throw statement even when `end` should not trigger that behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only trigger the warning and throw statement when `end` is explicitly `false`, ignoring other falsy values like `null` or `undefined`, which may not be the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it will trigger the warning and throw statement for any falsy value of `end`, including `null`, `undefined`, `0`, or `false`, which may lead to unintended consequences in the flow of the program.

DONE.
