  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the strict equality operator `===` to check if `tokens` is null, while the new code uses the abstract equality operator `==` to check if `tokens` is null. The abstract equality operator will return true if the operands are equal or if they are both null, while the strict equality operator will only return true if the operands are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if `tokens` is null, while the new code checks if the length of `tokens` is 0. If `tokens` is null, then the length of `tokens` will also be 0, so the new code will return true even if `tokens` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === null
```
This would result in different
