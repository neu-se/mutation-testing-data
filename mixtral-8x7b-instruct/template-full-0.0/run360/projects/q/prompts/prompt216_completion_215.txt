 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` would return `false`, and the promise would be immediately resolved with the value `42` instead of being assimilated as a thenable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always wrap the value in a new promise, even if it is already a promise. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

DONE.
