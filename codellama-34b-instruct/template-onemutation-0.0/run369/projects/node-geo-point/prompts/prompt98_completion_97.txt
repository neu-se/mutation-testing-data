  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function takes two arguments, and the second argument is used to determine the quadrant of the result. By replacing `x` with `y`, the result of the `atan2` function will be different, which will affect the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
