 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['re'] * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this['re'] * 2` is finite, not `this['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, regardless of the value of `this['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] > 10000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this['re']` is greater than 10000, not if `this['im']` is finite.

DONE.
