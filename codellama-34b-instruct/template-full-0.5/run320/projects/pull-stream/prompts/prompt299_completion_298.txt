  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with the data, even if the test failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with null, even if the test passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with the value of the `ended` variable, even if the test failed.

DONE.
