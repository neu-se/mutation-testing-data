  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset > index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over the current operation if the offset is greater than the index, instead of only skipping over deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only skip over the current operation if the index is greater than the offset, instead of skipping over all operations that come before the current offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset >= index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over the current operation if the offset is greater than or equal to the index, instead of only skipping over deletions.

DONE.
