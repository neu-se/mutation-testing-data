  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to match words that end with a consonant followed by "o", instead of words that end with a vowel followed by "o". This would cause the function to return the wrong plural form for words like "photo" and "radio".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o$/, 'os') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to match words that end with a vowel followed by "o", and the replacement function has been modified to replace the "o" with "os". This would cause the function to return the wrong plural form for words like "photo" and "radio".
