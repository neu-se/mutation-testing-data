  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not being listened to in the original code, so the promise would not be resolved when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is not being listened to in the original code, so the promise would not be resolved when the output stream finishes writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is not being listened to in the original code, so the promise would not be resolved when the output stream ends.

DONE.
