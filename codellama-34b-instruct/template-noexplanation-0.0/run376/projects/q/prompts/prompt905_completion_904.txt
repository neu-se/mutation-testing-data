  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)
```
This code fragment will remove the last element from the `nodeArgs` array, which is the callback function that is passed to the `nfcall` method. This will cause the `nfcall` method to not be able to resolve the promise, leading to a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will remove the first element from the `nodeArgs` array, which is the callback function that is passed to the `nfcall` method. This will cause the `nfcall` method to not be able to resolve the promise, leading to a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(["foo"])
```
This code fragment will add a new element to the `nodeArgs` array, which is the string "foo". This will cause the `nfcall` method
