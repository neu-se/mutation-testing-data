  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null`, which may cause issues if the function is expected to return a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the function to return `0` instead of `null`, which may cause issues if the function is expected to return a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This change will cause the function to return an empty string instead of `null`, which may cause issues if the function is expected to return a specific value.

DONE.
