  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, while the replacement code fragment is a string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, while the replacement code fragment is a function call with a different name.

DONE.
