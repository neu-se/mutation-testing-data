Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the asynchronous `fs.readFile` method instead of the synchronous `fs.readFileSync`, which would lead to a promise being returned instead of the expected immediate result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the encoding option to always be 'utf8', potentially altering the way binary files are read, which could lead to incorrect data being parsed if the file is not in UTF-8 format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options, (err, data) => { return data; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to use a callback with the synchronous `fs.readFileSync` method, which does not accept a callback, leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
