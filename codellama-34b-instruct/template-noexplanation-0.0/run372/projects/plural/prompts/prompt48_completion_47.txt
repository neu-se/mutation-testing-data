  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra "s" to the end of the word, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra "e" to the end of the word, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
