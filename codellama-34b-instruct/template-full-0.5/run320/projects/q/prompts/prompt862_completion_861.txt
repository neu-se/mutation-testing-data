  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout).then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `delay` method, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout).then(function (value) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a different `value` argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout).then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a different `value` argument than the original code, and the function would return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
