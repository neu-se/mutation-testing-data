  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `peekLength` method with parentheses returns the length of the next operation plus one. This change would cause the `diff` method to consider an extra operation in the `other` delta, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `peekLength` method with parentheses returns the length of the next operation minus one. This change would cause the `diff` method to consider one less operation in the `other` delta, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior
