  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.toString()` would return the string representation of the object, whereas `this` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `num.toString()` would return the string representation of the number, whereas `num` would return the number itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the object, whereas `this` would return the object itself.

DONE.
