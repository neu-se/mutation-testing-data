  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and then adds "ices" to the end, while the buggy code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last three characters of the word and then adds "ices" to the end.

DONE.
