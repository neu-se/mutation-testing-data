  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler` is an object, and `handler === undefined` will always be false, even if `handler` is an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler` is an object, and `handler.length` will always be undefined, even if `handler` is an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(handler).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(handler)` will return an array of the object's own enumerable property names, and `Object.keys(handler).length` will return the number of properties in the object. If the object is empty, `Object.keys(handler).length` will be 0.

DONE.
