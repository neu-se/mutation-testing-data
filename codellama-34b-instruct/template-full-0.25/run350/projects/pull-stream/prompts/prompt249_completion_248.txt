  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not called, which could cause the stream to continue processing even after it has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not called, which could cause the stream to continue processing even after it has been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not called, which could cause the stream to continue processing even after it has been aborted.

DONE.
