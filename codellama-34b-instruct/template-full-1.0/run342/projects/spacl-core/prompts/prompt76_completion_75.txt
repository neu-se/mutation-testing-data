  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the scope of the variable `rule`, which could potentially affect the behavior of the `clone()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules.slice()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as `this.rules`, which could affect the behavior of the `clone()` method if it relies on the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules.concat([])) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as `this.rules`, and then concatenates it with an empty array, which could affect the behavior of the `clone()` method if it relies on the original array.

DONE.
