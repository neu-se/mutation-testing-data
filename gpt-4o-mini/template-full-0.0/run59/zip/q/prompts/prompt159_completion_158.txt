Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error.stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the concatenated stack trace with the original error's stack trace, potentially losing the context of the promise's stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `undefined`, effectively removing the stack trace information from the error object, which could lead to loss of debugging information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise.stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the error's stack with only the promise's stack trace, ignoring the original error's stack, which may lead to confusion when debugging the error.

DONE.
