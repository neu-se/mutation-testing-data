  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array containing the specified elements of the original array, whereas the `concat` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes elements from the original array and returns the removed elements, whereas the `concat` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the `concat` method returns a new array containing the elements of the original array and the elements of the argument array.

DONE.
