  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error, whereas `void 0` is a valid function and would not cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error, whereas `void 0` is a valid function and would not cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would be called instead of `void 0`, and would not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
