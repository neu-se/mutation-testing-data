  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+=` operator has a lower precedence than the `++` operator, so it would be evaluated first, which could change the outcome of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-=` operator has a higher precedence than the `++` operator, so it would be evaluated first, which could change the outcome of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a lower precedence than the `++` operator, so it would be evaluated first, which could change the outcome of the loop.

DONE.
