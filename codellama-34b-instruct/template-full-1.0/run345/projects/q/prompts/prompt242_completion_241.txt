  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, so `nearerValue.value` would be `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, so `nearerValue.promise` would be another promise with the same state and value as `nearerValue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is a promise, so `nearerValue + 1` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value that is one greater than the resolved value of `nearerValue`.

DONE.
