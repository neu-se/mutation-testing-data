Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `delta` with an empty array instead of a copy of `this.ops`, leading to the loss of all operations from `this` and potentially causing unexpected results in the concatenated `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to slice `this.ops` using the length of `other.ops`, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or an incorrect number of operations being included in the new `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a `Delta` that excludes the last operation from `this.ops`, potentially altering the intended composition of operations and leading to incorrect results in the final `Delta`.

DONE.
