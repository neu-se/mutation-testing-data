  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because 'fail' is a method that would cause the promise to reject, while 'dispatch' is a method that would cause the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because 'resolve' is a method that would cause the promise to resolve, while 'dispatch' is a method that would cause the promise to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because 'reject' is a method that would cause the promise to reject, while 'dispatch' is a method that would cause the promise to resolve.

DONE.
