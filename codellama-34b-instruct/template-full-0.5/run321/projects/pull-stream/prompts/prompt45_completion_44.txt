  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of the original condition would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `read` is a function with a `source` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only be true if `read` is a function with a `source` property that is a number, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only be true if `read` is a function with a `source` property that is an object, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
