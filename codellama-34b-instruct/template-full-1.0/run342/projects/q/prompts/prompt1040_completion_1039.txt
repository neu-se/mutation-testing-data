  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` method creates a new promise object, and the `reject()` method resolves the promise object with a rejection reason. In contrast, the original code uses `resolve()` to resolve the promise object with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` method creates a new promise object, and the `resolve()` method resolves the promise object with a value. In contrast, the original code uses `resolve()` to resolve the promise object with a value, but the value is a rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` method creates a new promise object, and the `resolve()` method resolves the promise object with a value. In
