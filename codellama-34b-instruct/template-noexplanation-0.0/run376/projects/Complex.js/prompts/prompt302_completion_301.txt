  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which will in turn affect the calculation of the `tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which will in turn affect the calculation of the `tan` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This change will cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which will in turn affect the calculation of the `tan` function.

DONE.
