  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause errors in the algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause errors in the algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `x`, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause errors in the algorithm.

DONE.
