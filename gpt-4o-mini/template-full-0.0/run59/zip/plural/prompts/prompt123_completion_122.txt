Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence|fruit)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds "fruit" to the list of uncountable nouns, which is not part of the original set, potentially allowing "fruit" to be treated as uncountable when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence|happiness|sadness)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces "happiness" and "sadness" as uncountable nouns, which are not included in the original list, thus changing the treatment of these words in pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|
