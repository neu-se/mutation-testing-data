  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would cause the `fs.readFileSync` function to read a file with a different name than the original, which could result in different behavior if the file does not exist or if the file contents are not in the expected format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would cause the `fs.readFileSync` function to fail with a null reference error, which could result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'file.json'
```
This would cause the `fs.readFileSync` function to read a file with a different name than the original, which could result in different behavior if the file does not exist or if the file contents are not in the expected format.

DONE.
