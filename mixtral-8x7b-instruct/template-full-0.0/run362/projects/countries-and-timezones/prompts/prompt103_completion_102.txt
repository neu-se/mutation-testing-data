 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, prev)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of mutating the existing one, which might cause inconsistencies in the data used by other parts of the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the filtered timezones (without the `deprecated` property set to `true`) in the result, which could cause some tests to fail if they expect the filtered timezones to be present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev['newKey'] = tzs[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new property to the `prev` object instead of modifying the existing one, which could cause inconsistencies in the data used by other parts of the application and might cause some tests to fail.

DONE.
