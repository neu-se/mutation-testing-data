 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the longitude value, which can lead to incorrect calculations or behavior in methods that rely on the longitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the longitude to 0, which can lead to incorrect calculations or behavior in methods that rely on the longitude value. This could be particularly problematic if the codebase assumes that longitude values are always positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random float number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) instead of using the original longitude value. This can lead to unpredictable results and issues in methods that rely on the longitude value.

DONE.
