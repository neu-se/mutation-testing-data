  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the `arg()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the `sin()` and `cos()` methods.

DONE.
