  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an Error object, but null would be a different type of object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an Error object with a specific error message, but this new Error object would have a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an Error object, but undefined would be a different type of object.

DONE.
