  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `cos` of `b`, whereas the new code calculates the `cos` of `-b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b**2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the `cos` of `b`, whereas the new code calculates the `cos` of `b**2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable and the original code does not use it.

DONE.
