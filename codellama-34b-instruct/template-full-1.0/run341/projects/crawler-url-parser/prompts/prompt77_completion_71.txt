  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^blah/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the word "blah" with an empty string, which would change the value of `embedBaseUrlStr` and potentially affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of an array created by splitting `embedBaseUrlStr` using a comma as the separator, which would potentially change the value of `baseUrlStr` and affect the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make all the characters in `embedBaseUrlStr` lowercase, which would potentially change the type of the variable and affect its behavior in the rest of the code.

DONE.
