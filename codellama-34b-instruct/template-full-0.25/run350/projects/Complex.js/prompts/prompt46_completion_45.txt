  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.hasOwnProperty('im') && a.hasOwnProperty('re')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is present on the object itself, whereas the original code uses the `in` operator which checks if the property is present on the object or its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 'im') && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 're')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `Object.prototype` object, which checks if the property is present on the object itself, whereas the original code uses the `in` operator which checks if the property is present on the object or its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.propertyIsEnumerable('im') && a.propertyIsEnumerable('re')
```
