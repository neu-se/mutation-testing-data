  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now match any URL that contains the dollar sign (`$`) instead of the specific URLs that contain an octothorpe (`#`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href') + '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now return the value of the href attribute of the link element, appended with the dollar sign (`$`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
($('a').attr('href') || '').indexOf('#') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now return true if the href attribute of the link element contains the dollar sign (`$`), and false otherwise.
