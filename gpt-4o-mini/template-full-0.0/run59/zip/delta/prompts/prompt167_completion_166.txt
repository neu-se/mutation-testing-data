Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the next operation from `thisIter` instead of the current `otherOp`, potentially altering the composition of the delta by including an operation from the current instance instead of the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push({ delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a new operation with a delete property set to 1, which does not correspond to the actual operation from `otherOp`, thus changing the intended composition of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain ? otherOp : { insert: 'default' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it conditionally pushes `otherOp` if it has a retain property; otherwise, it pushes a new operation with a default insert value, which could lead to unexpected results in the delta composition.

DONE.
