  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a placeholder value to `makeNodeResolver`, which would be replaced with the actual value when the function was called. However, passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error if it expected a function as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a placeholder value to `makeNodeResolver`, which would be replaced with the actual value when the function was called. However, passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error if it expected a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a placeholder value to `makeNodeResolver`,
