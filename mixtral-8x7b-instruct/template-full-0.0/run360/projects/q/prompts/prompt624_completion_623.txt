 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method should modify the property of the target object, but this change would always set the property to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` treats its argument as a resolved promise, and in this case, it would always set the property to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Set failed'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise returned by the `set` method instead of resolving it with the new value. This could potentially hide errors in the code and make debugging more difficult.

DONE.
