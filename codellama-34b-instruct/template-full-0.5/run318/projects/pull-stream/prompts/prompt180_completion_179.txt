  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is a boolean, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value, potentially causing the `abortCb` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `abort`, potentially causing the `abortCb` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first truthy value, so if `abort` is falsey, it would return `true`, potentially causing the `abortCb` function to behave differently.

DONE.
