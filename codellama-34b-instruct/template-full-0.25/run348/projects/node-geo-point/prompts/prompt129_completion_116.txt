  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a tile with a zoom level that is one level higher than the original zoom level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a tile with a zoom level that is one level lower than the original zoom level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a tile with a zoom level that is two levels higher than the original zoom level.

DONE.
