  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('(?:/[^/]+){1,' + min + '}')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a quantifier with a minimum value of 1, but the new code uses a quantifier with a minimum value of `min`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('(?:/[^/]+)*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a quantifier with a minimum value of 1, but the new code uses a quantifier with a minimum value of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('(?:/[^/]+){1,' + (min + 1) + '}')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a quantifier with a minimum value of 1, but the new code uses a quantifier with a minimum value of `min + 1`.

DONE.
