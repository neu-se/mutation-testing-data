  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this._writeStream.on('drain', () => {
  this._waitForDrain = false;
  if (!this._queue.size) {
    if (this._inFlightWrites > 0) this.emit('drain');
  } else {
    this._flush();
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this._inFlightWrites` is less than or equal to 0, while the replaced code checks if it is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this._writeStream.on('drain', () => {
  this._waitForDrain = false;
  if (!this._queue.size) {
    if (this._inFlightWrites <= 0) this.emit('drain');
  } else {
    this._flush();
  }
});
