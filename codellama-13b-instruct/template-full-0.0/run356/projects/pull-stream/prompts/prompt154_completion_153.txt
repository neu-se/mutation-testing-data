  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with a `null` argument, rather than being passed as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, rather than being passed as a callback.

DONE.
