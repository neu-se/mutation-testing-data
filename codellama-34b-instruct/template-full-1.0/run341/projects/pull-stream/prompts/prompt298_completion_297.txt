  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would call the callback function when the stream ended. By replacing it with `null`, the callback function would not be called, and the stream would not be ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would call the callback function when the stream ended. By replacing it with an empty function, the callback function would not be called, and the stream would not be ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would call the callback function when the stream ended. By replacing it with `cb("error")`, the callback function would be called with an error message, indicating that an error has occurred during the stream processing.

DONE.
