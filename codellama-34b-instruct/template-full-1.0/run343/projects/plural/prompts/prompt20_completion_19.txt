  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[xcs]$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment matches words ending in "x", "c", or "s", whereas the original fragment only matches words ending in "x" or "ch".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment only matches words ending in "x" or "s", whereas the original fragment matches words ending in "x", "ch", or "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ch$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment only matches words ending in "ch", whereas the original fragment matches words ending in "x", "ch", or "s".

DONE.
