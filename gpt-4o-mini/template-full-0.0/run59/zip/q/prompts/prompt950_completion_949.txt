Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the context for `apply` would cause the function to execute with a `null` context instead of the intended `thisp`, potentially leading to errors if the function relies on `this` to refer to a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window
```
This would result in different behavior because using `window` as the context would cause the function to execute in the global context (in a browser environment), which may not have the properties or methods expected by the function, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the context would cause the function to execute without a valid context, which can lead to `this` being set to the global object in non-strict mode or remaining `undefined` in strict mode, resulting in potential runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

DONE.
