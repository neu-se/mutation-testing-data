  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is now always set to "GET", regardless of the actual verb being used in the request. This would cause the `query` method to always return `true` for GET requests, even if the verb is not explicitly allowed by the rule.

DONE.
