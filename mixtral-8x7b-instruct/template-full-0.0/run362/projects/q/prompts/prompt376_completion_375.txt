 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` immediately resolves the promise with the progress value, bypassing the original logic of checking if the progress value is a promise and handling it accordingly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.log
