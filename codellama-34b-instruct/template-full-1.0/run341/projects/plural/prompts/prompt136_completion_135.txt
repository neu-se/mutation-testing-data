  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could cause the `plural` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could cause the `plural` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.substr(0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a substring of the original value, which could cause the `plural` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
