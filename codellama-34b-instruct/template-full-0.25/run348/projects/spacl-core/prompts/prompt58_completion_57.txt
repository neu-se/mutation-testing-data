  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code fragment is using `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the replacement string is using `$2`, which would refer to the second capture group. This would cause the replacement string to be incorrect and result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code fragment is using `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the replacement string is using `$0`, which would refer to the entire match. This would cause the replacement string to be incorrect and result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code fragment is using `$1` to refer to the first capture group,
