  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` returns a new array with the deleted elements, whereas `slice` returns a new array with the same elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `slice` returns a new array with the same elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element, whereas `slice` returns a new array with the same elements.

DONE.
