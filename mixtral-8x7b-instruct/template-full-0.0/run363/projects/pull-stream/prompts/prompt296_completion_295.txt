 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to true, allowing the code to terminate even if `end` is true, which should not happen in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the condition in the opposite way, continuing the loop even if the `test` function returns false, whereas the original code stops the loop in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires both `!test(data)` and `ended` to be true to terminate the loop, whereas the original code terminates the loop if either condition is true.

DONE.
