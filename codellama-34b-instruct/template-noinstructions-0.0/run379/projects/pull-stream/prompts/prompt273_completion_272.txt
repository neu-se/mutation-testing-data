  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` is not an object, while this replacement checks if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` is not undefined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
