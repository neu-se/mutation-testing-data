  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1, otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length of the iterators to be off by one, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1, otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length of the iterators to be off by one, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2, otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length of the iterators to be doubled, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results.

DONE.
