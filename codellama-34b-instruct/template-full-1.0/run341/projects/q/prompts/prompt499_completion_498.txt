  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, unlike `null`, which is an object. If the `name` parameter is not provided or has not been assigned a value, it will have the default value of `undefined`, and this code fragment will evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a more robust way to check for the absence of a value in JavaScript than `null` or `undefined`. It is used in the compiler for the "absent" value in the type system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof name === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `name` rather than its value. If `name` is not defined or has not been assigned a value, its type will be `'undefined'`, and the code fragment will evaluate to `true`.
