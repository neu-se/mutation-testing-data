Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "function" && typeof process.emit === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the types of `process` and `process.emit`, leading to a situation where the condition could be true even when `process` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, causing the condition to evaluate to true if either `process` is not an object or `process.emit` is not a function, which would prevent the rejection tracking from functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `process.emit` is `undefined`, which would always evaluate to true if the `emit` function is not defined, thus bypassing the intended functionality of emitting unhandled rejections.

DONE.
