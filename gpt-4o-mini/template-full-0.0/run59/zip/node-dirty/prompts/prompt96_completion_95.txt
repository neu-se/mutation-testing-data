Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `key` property of the `row` object is strictly equal to `undefined`, which would not account for the case where the `key` property exists but has a value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality to check if `row.key` is `null` or `undefined`, which would incorrectly allow for the presence of other falsy values (like `0` or `''`) to pass through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `row` object has a property named `key`, which would return `true` even if the value of `key` is `undefined`, thus not catching cases where the `key` property exists but is not set.

DONE.
