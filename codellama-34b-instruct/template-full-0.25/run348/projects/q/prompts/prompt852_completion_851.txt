  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with `null` as the reason for the rejection, which is different from the original code where the `error` object is passed as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with the string `"error"` as the reason for the rejection, which is different from the original code where the `error` object is passed as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with a new `Error` object as the reason for the rejection, which is different from the original code where the `error` object is passed as the reason.

DONE.
