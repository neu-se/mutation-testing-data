Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added character 'x' would alter the indexOf check, potentially causing it to fail to identify patterns that start with the escape symbol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GLOBSTAR
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check for the presence of the globstar pattern instead of the escape symbol, potentially leading to incorrect identification of dynamic patterns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would always be found in any pattern, causing the isDynamicPattern function to incorrectly identify all patterns as dynamic.

DONE.
