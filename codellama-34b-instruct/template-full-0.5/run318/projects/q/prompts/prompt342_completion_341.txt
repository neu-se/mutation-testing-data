  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the result of `_fulfilled(value)` instead of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the result of `_rejected(exception)` instead of `exception`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(_progressed(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the result of `_progressed(value)` instead of `value`.

DONE.
