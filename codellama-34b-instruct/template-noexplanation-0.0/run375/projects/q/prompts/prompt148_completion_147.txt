  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This change will cause the `__minimumStackCounter__` property to be set to a value that is one greater than the original value, which may cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter - 1, configurable: true}
```
This change will cause the `__minimumStackCounter__` property to be set to a value that is one less than the original value, which may cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "__minimumStackCounter__", {value: p.stackCounter * 2, configurable: true}
```
This change will cause the `__minimumStackCounter__` property to be set
