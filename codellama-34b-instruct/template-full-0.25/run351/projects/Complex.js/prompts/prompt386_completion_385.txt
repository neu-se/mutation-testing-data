  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to a different value than the original code, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to a different value than the original code, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
