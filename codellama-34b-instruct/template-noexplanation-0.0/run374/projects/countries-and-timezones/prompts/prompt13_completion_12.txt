  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This code fragment creates a new object with a single property, `country`, which is set to an object with two properties, `current` and `all`. The `current` property is set to an array containing the `id` value, and the `all` property is set to an array containing the `id` value. This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which creates an object with a single property, `country`, which is set to an object with two properties, `current` and `all`, both of which are set to empty arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous option, but it uses a different syntax to create the object. Instead of using the `Object.assign()` method, it uses the object literal syntax to create the object. This code fragment is also different from the original code fragment,
