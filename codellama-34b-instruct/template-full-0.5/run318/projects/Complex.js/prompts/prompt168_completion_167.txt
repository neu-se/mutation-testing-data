  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined on the `Complex` class, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Complex` instance, so the code would always return `true` if `z` is an instance of `Complex`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined on the `Complex` class, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
