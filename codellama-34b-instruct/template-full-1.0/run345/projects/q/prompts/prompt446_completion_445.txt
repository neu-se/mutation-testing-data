  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `pop` would remove the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than adding to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `unshift` would add the reason to the beginning of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `pop` would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than adding to it.

DONE.
