  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] + 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds 1 to the result of the ternary operator, which will cause the final result to be different in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it multiplies the result of the ternary operator by 2, which will cause the final result to be different in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] / 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it divides the result of the ternary operator by 2, which will cause the final result to be different in some cases.

DONE.
