  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so the promise would never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so the promise would never be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` creates a rejected promise, which would cause the `all` method to immediately reject the promise.

DONE.
