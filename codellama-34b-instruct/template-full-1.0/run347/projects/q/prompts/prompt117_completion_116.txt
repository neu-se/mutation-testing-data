  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` would iterate over the array with the initial value `1` instead of the actual first array element, potentially changing the result of the reduction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` would iterate over the array using the string "abc" instead of the actual first array element, potentially changing the result of the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` would iterate over the array using a function as the initial value instead of the actual first array element, potentially changing the result of the reduction.

DONE.
