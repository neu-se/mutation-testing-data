 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toString() === src
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the directories as strings, which may not give the expected result when the directory paths are absolute or relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(targetBasePath) === path.resolve(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the directories to their absolute paths before comparison, which may not give the expected result when the directory paths are absolute or relative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `targetBasePath` includes the `src`, which is not the intended behavior of checking if they are equal.

DONE.
