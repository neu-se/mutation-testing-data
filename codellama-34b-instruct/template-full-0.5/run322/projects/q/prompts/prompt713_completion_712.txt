  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` and `values` are different methods in the `Q` object, and `values` is not a valid method for the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` expects an empty array as its argument, but passing `[1]` would cause the `keys` method to return the keys of the object at index 1, rather than the keys of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` expects an empty array as its argument, but passing `["foo"]` would cause the `keys` method to return the keys of the object at index "foo", rather than the keys of the object itself.

DONE.
