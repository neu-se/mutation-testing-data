  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error synchronously, while this new code fragment re-throws the error asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error with the original message, while this new code fragment re-throws the error with a new message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unhandled rejection: " + e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the "Unhandled rejection" message, while this new code fragment includes it.

DONE.
