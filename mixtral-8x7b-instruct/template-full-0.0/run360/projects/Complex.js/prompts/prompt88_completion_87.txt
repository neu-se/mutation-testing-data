 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the sign from the previous token and always treat the current token as positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the previous token instead of the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parseFloat` function to return `NaN` for the current token, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the complex number.

DONE.
