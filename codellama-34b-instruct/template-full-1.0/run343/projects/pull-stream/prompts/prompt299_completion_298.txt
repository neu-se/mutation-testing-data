  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the `data` argument to the callback function, while this new code passes `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `null` as the second argument to the callback function, while this new code passes `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `true` or `null` as the first argument to the callback function, while this new code passes `false`.

DONE.
