  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function (k) {
  return array[k]
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Object.keys` to get the keys of the `array` object, while this replacement code uses `array.map` to iterate over the values of the `array` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function (k) {
  return array[k] + 1
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the values of the `array` object, while this replacement code adds 1 to each value before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function (k) {
  return array[k] * 2
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the values of the `array` object, while this replacement code multiplies each value by 2 before returning it.
