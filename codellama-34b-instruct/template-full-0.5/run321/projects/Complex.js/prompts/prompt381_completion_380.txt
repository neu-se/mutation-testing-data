  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cosh` have different values for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cosh` have different values for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sec
```
This would result in different behavior because `sec` and `cosh` have different values for the same input.

DONE.
