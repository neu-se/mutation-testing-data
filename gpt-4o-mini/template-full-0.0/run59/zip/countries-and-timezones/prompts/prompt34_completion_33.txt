Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, which could lead to incorrect formatting of negative offsets, as it would not account for the absolute value of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, which would incorrectly format the offset string, potentially leading to an inaccurate representation of the time offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the input by -1 would negate the value, leading to incorrect hour and minute calculations in the offset string, thus misrepresenting the time zone offset.

DONE.
