  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous op instead of the current op, which could cause the iterator to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next op instead of the current op, which could cause the iterator to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index, this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the op array instead of a single op, which could cause the iterator to return incorrect values.

DONE.
