  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `length` characters instead of deleting them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete `length + 1` characters instead of just `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain `length` characters instead of deleting them.

DONE.
