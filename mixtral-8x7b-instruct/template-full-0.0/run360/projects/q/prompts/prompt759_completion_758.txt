 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
allResolved, "allResolved", "all"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would be using the `all` function instead of its own implementation, which could lead to incorrect results when handling an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
allResolved, "allResolved", Q.resolve
