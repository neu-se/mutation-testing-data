 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a protected method that should not be called directly. The `dispatch` method is used to ensure that the method is called in the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).thenDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenDispatch` is not a method of the Q promise object. Using `thenDispatch` instead of `dispatch` would bypass the logic to ensure the method is called in the next tick and could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that creates a rejected promise. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `Q(object).reject`, you would be creating a rejected promise instead of dispatching the "delete" message to the object. This could lead to unexpected
