  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code always abort, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code always continue reading, regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code always throw an error, regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
