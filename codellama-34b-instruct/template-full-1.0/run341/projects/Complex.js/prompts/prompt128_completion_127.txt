  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value returned by `z['isInfinite']`, potentially causing the condition to be met when it should not have been.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks whether a number is any kind of finite value, not just `Infinity`. This could cause the condition to be met even if `z` is not equal to `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNegative']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNegative` method checks whether a complex number is negative, which is not equivalent to being equal to `Infinity`.

DONE.
