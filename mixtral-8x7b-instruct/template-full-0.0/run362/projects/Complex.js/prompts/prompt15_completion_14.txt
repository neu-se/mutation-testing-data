 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a value 1 unit less than the actual cos(x) - 1, making it less accurate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the square of the input instead of the correct cos(x) - 1, making it significantly different from the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a random value between 0 and 1 instead of the correct cos(x) - 1, making it drastically different from the original function.

DONE.
