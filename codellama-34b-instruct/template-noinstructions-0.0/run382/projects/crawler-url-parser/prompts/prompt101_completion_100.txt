  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set` would overwrite the existing value in the map with the new value, whereas `urlMap.get` would return the existing value without modifying the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.delete` would remove the key-value pair from the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would return the existing value without modifying the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.clear` would remove all key-value pairs from the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would return the existing value without modifying the map.

DONE.
