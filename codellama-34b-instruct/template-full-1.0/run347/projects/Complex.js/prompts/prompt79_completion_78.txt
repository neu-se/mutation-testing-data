  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c, c === '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the "parser_exit()" function to be called more frequently than in the original code, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c, c === '('
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the "parser_exit()" function to be called more frequently than in the original code, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```c, c === ';'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the "parser_exit()" function to be called more frequently than in the original code, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

DONE.
