  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `retain` block to be executed when `op.attributes` is false, and the `else` block to be executed when `op.attributes` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `retain` block when `op.attributes` is true, regardless of the value of `op.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `retain` block when `op.attributes` is a non-empty array, regardless of the value of `op.retain`.

DONE.
