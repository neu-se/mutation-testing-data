  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a callback function that is called only when the promise is resolved, whereas `finally` is a function that is called when the promise is either resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected after a specified amount of time has elapsed, whereas `finally` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, regardless of whether it is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).always()
```
This would result in different behavior because `always` is a function that is called when the promise is either resolved or rejected, whereas `finally` is a function that is called only when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
