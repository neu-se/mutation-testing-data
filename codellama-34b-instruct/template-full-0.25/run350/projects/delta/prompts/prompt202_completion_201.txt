  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the method to return a slice of the delta starting from the specified index. This would result in a different return value than the original code, which would return a slice of the delta starting from the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the method to return a slice of the delta starting from the specified index. This would result in a different return value than the original code, which would return a slice of the delta starting from the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 2);
```
This would result in
