  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid operand for the `/` operator, and it would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid operand for the `/` operator, and it would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because `-a` is the complex conjugate of `a`, and the function would return a different value.

DONE.
