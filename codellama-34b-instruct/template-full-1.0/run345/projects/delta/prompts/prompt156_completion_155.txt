  
Option 1: Mutation Testing
-------------------------

Code fragment: "var number = 5 + 2;"

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is trying to perform a mathematical operation (+) on an invalid operand (null) which will produce an error. In the mutated code, a variable "number" is defined and assigned the value 7, which is the result of 5 + 2. Therefore, the error is eliminated, and the code would execute without throwing any errors.

Option 2: Mutation Testing
------------------------

Code fragment: "let numbers = [];
numbers.push(5);
numbers.push(2);

var sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; ++i) {
sum += numbers[i];
}
"

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is trying to perform a mathematical operation (+) on an invalid operand (null) which will produce an error. In the mutated code, the null value is replaced with an array "numbers" and an assignment statement is added, which
