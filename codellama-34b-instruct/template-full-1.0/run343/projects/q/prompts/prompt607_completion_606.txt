  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas `op` is a variable that contains the name of the operation to be performed. If `deferred.reject` is used in place of `op`, the code would no longer be able to perform the desired operation, and the promise would be rejected instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `op` variable. If `null` is used in place of `op`, the code would throw a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"Hello World!"` is a string value that does not represent a valid operation. If `"Hello World!"` is used in place of `op`,
