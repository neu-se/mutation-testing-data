  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` returns the first element of an array, while `join` returns a string with all elements joined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` returns the last element of an array, while `join` returns a string with all elements joined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a subset of an array, while `join` returns a string with all elements joined.

DONE.
