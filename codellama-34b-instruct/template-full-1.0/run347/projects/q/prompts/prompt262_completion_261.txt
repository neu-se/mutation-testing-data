  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a different function than `become`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a different function than `become`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved immediately instead of waiting for the `deferred.reject` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` is a different function than `become`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved after all promises in the array are resolved.

DONE.
