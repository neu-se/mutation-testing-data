  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the destination point to be calculated with a distance that is twice the original distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing parameter is increased by 90 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated with a bearing that is 90 degrees different from the original bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing parameter is multiplied by -1, which would cause the destination point to be calculated with a bearing that is 180 degrees opposite from the original bearing.

DONE.
