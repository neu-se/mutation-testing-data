  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fulfillment value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment would return the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason of the promise, whereas the original code fragment would return the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise (e.g. "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending"), whereas the original code fragment would return the promise itself.

DONE.
