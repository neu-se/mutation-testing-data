  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would cause the promise to be fulfilled immediately, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `Q`.

DONE.
