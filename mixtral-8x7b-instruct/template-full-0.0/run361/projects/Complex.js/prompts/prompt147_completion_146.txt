 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the divisor (z.im) is zero, while the original code fragment would return Complex['NAN'] for that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, while the original code fragment checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of z is zero, while the original code fragment checks if the value is infinite.

DONE.
