  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === NaN` would be true for any value of `a` that is not a number, including some values that are not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null || a === undefined || a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is evaluated even if it is `null` or `undefined`, which could cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(a)` would be true for any array, not just `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
