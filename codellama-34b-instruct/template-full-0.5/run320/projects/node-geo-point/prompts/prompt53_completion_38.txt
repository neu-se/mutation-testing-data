  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` term would be added to the `Δλ` term, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` term would be multiplied with the `Δλ` term, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ / φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` term would be divided by the `Δλ` term, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
