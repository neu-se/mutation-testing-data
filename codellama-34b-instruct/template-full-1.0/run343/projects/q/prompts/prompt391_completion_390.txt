  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to treat the `progressed` callback as `null`, rather than a function, and the `when` function would not call the `progressed` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to treat the `progressed` callback as an empty string, rather than a function, and the `when` function would not call the `progressed` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to treat the `progressed` callback as a number, rather than a function, and the `when` function would not call the `progressed` callback.

DONE.
