  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first capture group instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the second capture group from the second attempt instead of the first, which would cause the file name to be incorrect in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first capture group from the third attempt instead of the second, which would cause the line number to be incorrect in the stack trace.

DONE.
