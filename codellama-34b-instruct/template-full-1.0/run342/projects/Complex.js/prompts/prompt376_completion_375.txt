  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 2 times the input value, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part equal to the product of the input values, regardless of their sum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a complex number with a real part equal to the sum of the input values and an imaginary part of 0, regardless of their product.

DONE.
