  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `args` to an empty array, even if it was originally non-empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `args` to `null`, even if it was originally a non-empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `args` to `undefined`, even if it was originally a non-empty array.

DONE.
