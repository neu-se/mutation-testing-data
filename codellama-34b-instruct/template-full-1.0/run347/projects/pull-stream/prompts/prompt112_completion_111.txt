  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would never be modified, resulting in the wrong output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 acc += data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be incremented instead of set to the current value of `data`, resulting in the wrong output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = -data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be set to the negative of the current value of `data`, resulting in the wrong output.

DONE.
