 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('File not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always be 'File not found', even if the error is caused by something other than the file not being found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
err || new Error('File not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'File not found' as the error message even if the error is caused by something other than the file not being found. Additionally, it would suppress the original error, making it harder to debug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always be 'An error occurred', providing less information about the actual error.

DONE.
