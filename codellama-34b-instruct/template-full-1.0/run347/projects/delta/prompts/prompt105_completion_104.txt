  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(common.deepEquals)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deepEquals` is a function that checks whether two objects are recursively equivalent, while `forEach` is a function that executes a provided function once for each element in an array. Replacing `forEach` with `deepEquals` would result in the code attempting to check whether each element in the `ops` array is equivalent to the `deepEquals` function, which is unlikely to be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(common.deepEquals)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is a function that creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the input array, while `deepEquals` is a function that checks whether two objects are recursively equivalent. Replacing `map` with `deepEquals` would result in the code attempting to create a new array populated with the results of checking whether each element in the `ops` array is equivalent
