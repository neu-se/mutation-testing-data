  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return `true` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return `null` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return `undefined` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

DONE.
