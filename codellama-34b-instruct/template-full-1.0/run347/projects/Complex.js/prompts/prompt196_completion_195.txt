  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, which may have different properties and methods than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ZERO']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['ZERO']` is a different value than `b`.

DONE.
