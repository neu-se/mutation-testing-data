 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!final || !opt || min >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original condition, changing the logic of when the placeholder should be true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
final && opt && min === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison operator from `<` to `===`, which would alter the behavior when `min` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
final && opt && min > -1
