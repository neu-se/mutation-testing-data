  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. While `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number, `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. While `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number, `tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `cosh` is a function that returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number.

DONE.
