  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.resolve` is a different function than `self.reject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `self.resolve` instead of `self.reject`, which would lead to a different outcome in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherPromise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject a different promise than `self`.

DONE.
