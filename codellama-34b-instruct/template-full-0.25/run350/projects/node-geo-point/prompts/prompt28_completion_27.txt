  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = (point2.latitude + 180) % 360 - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deg2rad` to convert the latitude to radians, but this replacement code fragment adds 180 to the latitude before converting it to radians. This would cause the resulting bearing to be off by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = (point2.latitude + 360) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deg2rad` to convert the latitude to radians, but this replacement code fragment adds 360 to the latitude before converting it to radians. This would cause the resulting bearing to be off by 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = (point2.latitude + 90
