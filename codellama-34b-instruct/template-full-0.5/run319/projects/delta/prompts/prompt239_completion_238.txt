  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the length of the string is always greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, as the length of the string is reduced by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time, as the length of the string is increased by 1.

DONE.
