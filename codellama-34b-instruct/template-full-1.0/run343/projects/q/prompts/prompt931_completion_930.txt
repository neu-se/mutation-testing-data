  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would cause the function to be invoked with the provided `this` argument and the provided arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments that are provided both initially and when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is used to specify a callback function to be called when a promise is resolved or rejected, and it would cause the function to be called with the resolved value or the reason for rejection.

DONE.
