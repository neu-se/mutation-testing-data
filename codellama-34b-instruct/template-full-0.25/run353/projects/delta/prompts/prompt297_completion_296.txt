  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the attributes of the next two ops instead of just the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the index of the next op instead of the current one to the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the predicate function returns true instead of false.

DONE.
