 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolvedBad(promises) {
    return Q(promises).allSettled();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolvedBad` function now returns the result of `allSettled` instead of waiting for all promises to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolvedBad(promises) {
    return Q(promises).all();
}
