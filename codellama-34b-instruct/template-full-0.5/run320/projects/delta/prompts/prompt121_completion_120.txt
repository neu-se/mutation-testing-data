  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the op, which could cause the code to skip over the last op in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the op, which could cause the code to include an extra op in the delta that it shouldn't have.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the op, which could cause the code to include twice as many ops in the delta as it should have.

DONE.
