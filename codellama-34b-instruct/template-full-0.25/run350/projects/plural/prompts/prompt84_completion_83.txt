  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the word is "mouse" and returning "mice" if it is, but this new code fragment would return "mouses" if the word is "mouse".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the word is "mouse" and returning "mice" if it is, but this new code fragment would return "mice" concatenated with "s" if the word is "mouse".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the word is "mouse" and returning "mice" if it is, but this new code fragment would return "mice" concatenated with "es" if the word is "mouse".

DONE.
