  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function takes a start index as its second argument, and `2` is not the correct start index for the `args` array in this case. The correct start index is `1`, which would include the `callback` argument in the resulting array.

DONE.
