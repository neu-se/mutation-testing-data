  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would be executed with a value that is not a thenable, which would cause the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false`, and the `fulfill` function to be called instead of the `coerce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would be executed with a value that is not a thenable, which would cause the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false`, and the `fulfill` function to be called instead of the `coerce` function. Additionally, the `true` argument would cause the `coerce` function to return a rejected promise if the `value` is not a thenable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER
