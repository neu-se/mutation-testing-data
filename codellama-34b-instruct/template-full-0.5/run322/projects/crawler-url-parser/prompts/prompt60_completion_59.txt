  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `URL.parse()` is a boolean indicating whether to parse the query string. Setting it to `false` would cause the query string to be ignored, which could result in different parsing behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `URL.parse()` is a boolean indicating whether to parse the search string. Setting it to `false` would cause the search string to be ignored, which could result in different parsing behavior.
