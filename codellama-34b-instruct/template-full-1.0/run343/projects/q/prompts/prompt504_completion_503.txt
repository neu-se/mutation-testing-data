  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]["apply"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code retrieves the `apply` property of the `value[name]` object using the dot notation, while this version uses bracket notation. If the `apply` property is the only property of `value[name]`, then this change would not make a difference. However, if `value[name]` has other properties, such as `call` or `bind`, this change could cause different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `apply` property of the `value[name]` object, while this version uses the `call` property. If the `call` property is not defined on `value[name]`, then this change would result in a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `
