  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed in a more forgiving way. This could cause the `parse()` function to return `null` for some URLs that would otherwise be valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with a `null` value for the `baseURL` parameter, which means that the URL would not be resolved relative to a base URL. This could cause the `parse()` function to return a different URL than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with a different base URL than the one provided in the original code. This could cause the `parse()` function to return a different URL than expected.
