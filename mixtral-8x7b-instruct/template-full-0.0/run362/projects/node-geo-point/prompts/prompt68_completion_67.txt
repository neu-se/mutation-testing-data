 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis of a plane and the point given by the coordinates (y, x). Replacing it with a constant value would always return the same angle, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function is used to calculate the angle in radians of the vector from the origin to the point (x, y) on the unit circle. Using the regular `atan` function would not account for the quadrant of the point, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y / (x + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a constant value to `x` would change the input to the `atan` function, leading to
