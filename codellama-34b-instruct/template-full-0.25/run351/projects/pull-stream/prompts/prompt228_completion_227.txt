  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single value, while `data.length` is the length of the `data` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single value, while `data[0]` is the first element of the `data` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a single value, while `data.slice(1)` is the `data` array without its first element.

DONE.
