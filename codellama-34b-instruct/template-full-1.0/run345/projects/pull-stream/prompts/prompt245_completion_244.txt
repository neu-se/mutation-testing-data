  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to abort only if both `err` and `abort` are truthy, whereas the original code would abort if either `err` or `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to abort regardless of whether `err` is truthy or not, whereas the original code would only abort if `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to abort if `err` is falsy, whereas the original code would only abort if `err` is truthy.

DONE.
