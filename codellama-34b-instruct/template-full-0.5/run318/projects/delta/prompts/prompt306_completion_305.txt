  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line is empty, while this replacement checks if the line has only one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line is empty, while this replacement checks if the line has more than one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line is empty, while this replacement checks if the line has an even number of characters.

DONE.
