 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine = captureLine(Q.noConflict);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line where stack traces end, causing confusion in debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine = captureLine(null);
