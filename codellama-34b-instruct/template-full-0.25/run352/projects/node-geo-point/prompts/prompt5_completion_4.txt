  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would always return `true` if `point` is not an object, regardless of its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `type` property is present in the `point` object, but not if it has the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `type` property has the value `'Point'`, but not if it is present in the `point` object.

DONE.
