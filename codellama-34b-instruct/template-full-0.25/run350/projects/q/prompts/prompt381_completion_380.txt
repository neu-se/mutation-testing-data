  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and the `tap` method would not be chained to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called on the promise, and the `tap` method would not be chained to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on a rejected promise, and the `tap` method would not be chained to it.

DONE.
