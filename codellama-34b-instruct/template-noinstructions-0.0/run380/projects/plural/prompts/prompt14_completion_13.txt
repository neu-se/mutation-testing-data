  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the index to slice the string, but replacing it with 1 would always return the first character of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the index to slice the string, but replacing it with -1 would always return the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * word.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the index to slice the string, but replacing it with a random index would return a random character from the word.

DONE.
