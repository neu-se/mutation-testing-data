Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly indicate that the promise is not in the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to the `process.emit` call never being executed for unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if there are any unhandled rejections, preventing the `process.emit` call from being executed regardless of whether the promise is in the array or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only trigger the `process.emit` call if the promise is found at an index greater than 0, effectively ignoring the first occurrence of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
