  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb()` would call the `abortCb` function immediately, rather than storing it as a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb = 0` would assign the value `0` to the `abortCb` variable, rather than the intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb = 'abc'` would assign the value `'abc'` to the `abortCb` variable, rather than the intended value.

DONE.
