  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys` method would not be called on the object `b` and would instead return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.values` method would be called on the object `b` and would return an array of the object's values, which would then be compared to the value of `embedType`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.hasOwnProperty(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called on the object `b` and would return a boolean value indicating whether the object has a property with the specified name (`embedType`).

DONE.
