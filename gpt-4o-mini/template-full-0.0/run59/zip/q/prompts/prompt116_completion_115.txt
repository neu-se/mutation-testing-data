Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `0` as the index to the `callback` function, ignoring the actual index of the current element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the array instead of the current index, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the `callback` function as it would not be able to access the correct element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the index to the `callback` function, which could cause unexpected results or errors when trying to access elements in the array.

DONE.
