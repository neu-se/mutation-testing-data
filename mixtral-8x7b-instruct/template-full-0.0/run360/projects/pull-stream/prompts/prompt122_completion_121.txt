 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `source` is falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined`, or `0`), it would no longer propagate the error to the sink but instead pass an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source.length
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the `source` to the sink, it would pass the `length` property of `source`, which would likely cause an error if `source` is not an array or string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the `source` to the sink, it would pass the accumulator value `acc`, which may not be the desired behavior and could lead to incorrect reduction results.

DONE.
