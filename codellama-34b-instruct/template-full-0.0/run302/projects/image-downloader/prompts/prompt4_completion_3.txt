  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the length of `options.dest` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.indexOf('.') === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the string `options.dest` contains a dot.

DONE.
