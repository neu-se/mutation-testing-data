  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter is an array, and by using `args[0]`, we are only considering the first element of the array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.length` property is the number of elements in the `args` array, and by using it as the third argument, we are passing the length of the array instead of the array itself, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.slice(1)` method returns a new array with all elements except the first one, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
