  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the string from the second character instead of the first, which could cause the regex to match different parts of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the string from the last character instead of the first, which could cause the regex to match different parts of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the string from the first character to the second character instead of from the first character to the end of the string, which could cause the regex to match different parts of the path.

DONE.
