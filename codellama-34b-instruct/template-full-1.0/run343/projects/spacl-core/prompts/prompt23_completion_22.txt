  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any(x => x.includes(string))
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` will return `true` if any element of the array includes the search string, whereas the original code checks if the string is strictly equal to any element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
includes(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` will return `true` if the string is a substring of any element of the array, whereas the original code checks if the string is strictly equal to any element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
find(x => x.startsWith(string))
```
This would result in different behavior because `find` will return the first element of the array that starts with the search string, whereas the original code checks if the string is strictly equal to any element of the array.

DONE.
