  The given JavaScript code appears to be a library for working with promises. The code defines a number of different functions, variables, and methods for creating and working with promises. There are several PLACEHOLDERs in the code, which are where you can replace code fragments with different options. Here are three different options for replacing the PLACEHOLDERs, along with brief explanations of why each option would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The first PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "null". Here's an example of the changed line of code:
```
become(null);
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code because "null" is not a thenable, which means that it does not have a "then" method that can be used to retrieve the resolved value of the promise. When the code calls the "become" method with "null" as its argument, the method will try to retrieve the resolved value by calling the "then" method on "null", which will fail. This will cause the promise to reject, which is different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The second PLACEHOLDER
