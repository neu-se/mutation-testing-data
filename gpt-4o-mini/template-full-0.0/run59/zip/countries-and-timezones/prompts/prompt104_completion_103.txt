Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to each timezone instead of the actual timezone object, which would lead to the loss of all timezone data in the returned object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key].deprecated ? tzs[key] : null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include only the deprecated timezones in the returned object, effectively filtering out all non-deprecated timezones, contrary to the original intent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key].name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the timezone object with just the name of the timezone, losing all other properties and structure of the original timezone object.

DONE.
