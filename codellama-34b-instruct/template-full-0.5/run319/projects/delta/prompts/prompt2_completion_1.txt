  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `b` object to be reassigned to an empty object, even if it was originally defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `b` object to be reassigned to an empty object, even if it was originally defined and not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `b` object to be reassigned to an empty object, even if it was originally defined and not falsy.

DONE.
