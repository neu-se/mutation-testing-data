  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.abort();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort()` method aborts the archiving process, whereas `finalize()` finalizes it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.append(null, { name: '../evil.txt' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `append()` method adds a file to the archive, whereas the original code does not. The `../evil.txt` file name would also be outside of the current directory, indicating a potential security vulnerability.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file('../evil.txt', { name: '../evil.txt' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file()` method adds a file to the archive, whereas the original code does not. The `../evil.txt` file name would also be outside of the current directory, indicating a potential security vulnerability.
