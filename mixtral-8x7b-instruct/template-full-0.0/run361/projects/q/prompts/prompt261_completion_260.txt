 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always skip the `become` call, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always return early, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.
