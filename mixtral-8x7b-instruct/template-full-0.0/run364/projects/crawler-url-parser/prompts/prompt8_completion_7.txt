 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrl` is truthy and then checks if it's illegal, instead of checking if the string value of `currentUrl` contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!!("currentUrl" && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the string "currentUrl" to a boolean and checks if it's truthy, and then checks if the string value of `currentUrl` contains illegal characters. This would always return true, as the string "currentUrl" is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_has_illegal_chars("currentUrl")
