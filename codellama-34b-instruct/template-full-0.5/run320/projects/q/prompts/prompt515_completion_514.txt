  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello World"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a promise, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal, which would result in a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a promise, while the replacement code fragment is a number literal, which would result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a promise, while the replacement code fragment is undefined, which would result in a type error.

DONE.
