  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `null` for the `baseUrl` variable, which would then cause the `extract` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `baseUrl.url` property.

DONE.
