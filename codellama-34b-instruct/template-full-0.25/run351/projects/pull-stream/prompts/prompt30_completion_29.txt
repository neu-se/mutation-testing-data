  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, so the value returned by the function would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the function would be different due to the addition of 1 to the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the function would be different due to the multiplication of 2 to the index.

DONE.
