  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id]` would always be truthy, even if the country with the given `id` is not present in the `countries` object. In the original code, the `!` operator was used to check if the country is not present in the object. DONE.
