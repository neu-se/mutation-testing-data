  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Map.values(new Map())`. This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array, while the original code retrieves the values from the `urlMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Map.keys(new Map())`. This would result in different behavior because it would return the keys from a new map object, while the original code retrieves the keys from the `urlMap` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Map.entries(new Map())`. This would result in different behavior because it would return the key-value pairs from a new map object, while the original code retrieves the key-value pairs from the `urlMap` object.

DONE.
