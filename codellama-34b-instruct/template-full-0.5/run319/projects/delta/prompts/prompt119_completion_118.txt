  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is not a valid property access and would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.attributes` is an object and `retain` is not a property of that object. Accessing `elem.attributes.retain` would return `undefined` and the code would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is not a valid property access and would throw a `TypeError` when trying to assign a value to it.

DONE.
