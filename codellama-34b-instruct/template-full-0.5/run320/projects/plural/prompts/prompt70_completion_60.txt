  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "cello" to the list of rules, while the modified code fragment adds a rule for the word "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "cello" to the list of rules, while the modified code fragment adds a rule for the word "cello" to the list of rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'violin')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "cello" to the list of rules, while the modified code fragment adds a rule for the word "violin" to the list of rules.

DONE.
