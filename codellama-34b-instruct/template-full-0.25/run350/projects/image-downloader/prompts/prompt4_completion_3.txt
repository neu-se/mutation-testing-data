  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is strictly equal to `undefined`. If `options.dest` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or an empty string), the original code fragment would still pass, but this new code fragment would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not strictly equal to `undefined`. If `options.dest` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or an empty string), the original code fragment would still pass, but this new code fragment would pass as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.dest === 'undefined'
