  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the deleted content instead of pushing it, which would cause the delta to have a different length and potentially different content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the deleted content instead of pushing it, which would cause the delta to have a different length and potentially different content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the retained content instead of deleting it, which would cause the delta to have a different length and potentially different content.

DONE.
