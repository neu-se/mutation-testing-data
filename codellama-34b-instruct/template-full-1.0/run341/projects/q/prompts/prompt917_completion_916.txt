  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, which can lead to unintended changes in the code's behavior, and potentially cause bugs that are difficult to detect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` method removes the last element of an array, which can lead to unexpected changes in the code's behavior, especially if the element being removed is used later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` method changes the contents of an array, which can lead to unintended changes in the code's behavior, especially if the element being spliced is used later in the code. DONE.
