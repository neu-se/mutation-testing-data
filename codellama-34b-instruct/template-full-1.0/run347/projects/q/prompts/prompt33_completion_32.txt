  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.pop()` would return the value of the last element in the `laterQueue` array, whereas `task` refers to the function that needs to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() {}` is a function expression that would return a function object, whereas `task` is expected to be a function that needs to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() {}, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(function() {}, 0)` would schedule the function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds, whereas `task` is expected to be executed immediately.

DONE.
