  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `Q.fbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `Q.fbind` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `Q.fbind` function.

DONE.
