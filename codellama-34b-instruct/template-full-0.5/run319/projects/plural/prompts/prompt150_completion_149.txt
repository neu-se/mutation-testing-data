  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'plurals'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "plurals" instead of the plural form of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'singulars'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "singulars" instead of the singular form of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'irregulars'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "irregulars" instead of the irregular form of the input word.

DONE.
