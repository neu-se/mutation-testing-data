  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered, potentially causing the program to fail to function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, potentially causing the program to function incorrectly.

DONE.
