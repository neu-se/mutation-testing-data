 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string literal "<PLACEHOLDER>" instead of processing the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array instead of the filtered stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "This is a dummy function"; }
