Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for writing instead of reading, potentially causing data loss or corruption if the file is not intended to be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists, which could lead to unexpected errors if the file is expected to exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for appending, which could cause issues if the file is expected to be read from the beginning, as the file pointer would be positioned at the end of the file instead.

DONE.
