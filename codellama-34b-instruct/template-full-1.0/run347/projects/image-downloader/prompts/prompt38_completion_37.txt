  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'something'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the filename that is written to, which could cause the file to be created in the wrong location or with an incorrect name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `pipe` method on a non-existent `dest` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access the `undefined` variable.

DONE.
