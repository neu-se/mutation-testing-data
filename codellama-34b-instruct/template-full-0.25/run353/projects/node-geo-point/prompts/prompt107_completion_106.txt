  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value for the zoom level, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would use a different value for the radius of the Earth, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would use a different value for the base of the natural logarithm, which would affect the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
