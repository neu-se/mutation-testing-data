  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called on the `cbs` array, which would add the `cb` function to the end of the array. In the original code, the `push` method was not called, so the `cbs` array would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method would be called on the `cbs` array, which would add the `cb` function to the beginning of the array. In the original code, the `push` method was not called, so the `cbs` array would not be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would be called on the `cbs` array, which would remove the last element of the array.
