  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the space character would be used as the newline character, rather than the newline character specified in the EOL parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be used as the newline character, rather than the newline character specified in the EOL parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null would be used as the newline character, rather than the newline character specified in the EOL parameter.

DONE.
