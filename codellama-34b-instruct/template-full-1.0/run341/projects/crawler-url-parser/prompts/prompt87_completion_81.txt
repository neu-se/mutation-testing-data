  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the output of the `.text()` function entirely, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code that relies on that output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text((index, text) => text.trim());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trim the text in a more complex way, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code that relies on that output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(text => text.trim());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trim the text in a more complex way, potentially causing issues with the rest of the code that relies on that output.

DONE.
