  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the replacement code fragment `done(null)` is a function call that passes `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the replacement code fragment `done(new Error())` is a function call that passes a new `Error` object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the replacement code fragment `done(undefined)` is a function call that passes `undefined` as an argument.

DONE.
