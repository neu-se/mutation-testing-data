  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 2
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate two extra times, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
