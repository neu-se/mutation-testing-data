  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert, while this replacement checks if the next operation is a delete. This would result in different execution paths, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert, while this replacement checks if the next operation is an insert and if there is a next operation. This would result in different execution paths, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert, while this replacement always evaluates to `false`. This would result in different execution paths, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
