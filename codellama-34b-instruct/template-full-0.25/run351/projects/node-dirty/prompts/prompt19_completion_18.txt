  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[]` would always be an empty array, regardless of the value of `cbs`, which would cause the `set` method to always overwrite the existing value in the database, rather than appending to the existing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` would always be a null value, regardless of the value of `cbs`, which would cause the `set` method to always overwrite the existing value in the database, rather than appending to the existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would create a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, which would cause the `set` method to append the new value to the existing value in the database, rather than overwriting it.

DONE.
