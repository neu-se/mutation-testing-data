  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.makePromise` is a method that creates a new promise, while `Q` is a constructor that creates a new instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a method that resolves a promise, while `Q` is a constructor that creates a new instance of the `Promise` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.makePromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.makePromise` is a method that creates a new promise, while `Promise` is a constructor that creates a new instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
