  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + 1, x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `x['re']` and affect the calculation of `x['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * 2, x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `x['re']` and affect the calculation of `x['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] / 2, x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` would change the value of `x['re']` and affect the calculation of `x['im']`.

DONE.
