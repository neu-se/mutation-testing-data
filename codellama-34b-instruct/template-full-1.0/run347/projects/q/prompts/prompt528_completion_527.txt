  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q({}).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q({}).inspect` will return a promise object instead of the original object, which was expected to be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var foo = "bar";
Q(foo).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is a string and not an object, so `Q(foo).inspect` will return a rejected promise instead of the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q({}).delay(10).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q({}).delay(10).inspect` will return a promise object that is resolved after 10 milliseconds instead of the original object, which was expected to be an object.

DONE.
