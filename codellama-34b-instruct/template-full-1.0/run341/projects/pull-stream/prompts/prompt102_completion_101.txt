  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` and `console.log` have different output formats.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.stdout.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.stdout.write` is a direct write to the standard output stream, whereas `console.log` is a high-level method that uses the standard output stream by default.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.parent.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `module.parent.log` would log to the parent module's log, whereas `console.log` would log to the current module's log.

DONE.
