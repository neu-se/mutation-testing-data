  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a resolved promise, while this replacement creates a deferred object with a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a resolved promise, while this replacement creates a deferred object with a rejected promise with a specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a resolved promise, while this replacement creates a deferred object with a rejected promise with a specific error message.

DONE.
