Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the data instead of the data itself, which could lead to false positives if the data is an empty array or string, causing the filter to incorrectly process the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data is falsy (null, undefined, 0, "", etc.) instead of checking the actual data, which could lead to skipping valid data that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if the data is null, which would cause the filter to ignore all other valid data types (like strings, numbers, or objects) that should be processed, leading to incorrect filtering behavior.

DONE.
