  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is different. The original code uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code uses the `!==` operator, which checks for strict inequality. This means that the new code will always evaluate to true, even if the values of `x` and `y` are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < y
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is different. The original code uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code uses the `<` operator, which checks for less than. This means that the new code will only evaluate to true if `x` is less than `y`, while the original code would evaluate to true if `x` and `y` are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is different. The original
