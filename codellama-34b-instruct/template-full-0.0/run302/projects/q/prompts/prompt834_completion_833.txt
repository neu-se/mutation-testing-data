  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` parameter is not being used in the original code, and including it would cause the `then` method to be called with three arguments instead of two, which could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to the `then` method, which could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior if it is expecting a function or other value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `then` method, which could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior if it is expecting a function or other value.

DONE.
