  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `pathname` is a string, while `pathname.split('/').pop()` is an array. This change would cause the `decodeURIComponent` function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `Promise.reject` statement and returned as a rejected promise.

DONE.
