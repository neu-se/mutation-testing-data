  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the case where the link URL has the same number of path parts as the page URL, which is not handled in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the case where the link URL has fewer path parts than the page URL, which is not handled in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path is a sub-path of the page URL path, which is not handled in the original code.

DONE.
