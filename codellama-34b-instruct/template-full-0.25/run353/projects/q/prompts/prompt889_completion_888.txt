  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument instead of the first to the `nfcall` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument instead of the first to the `nfcall` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth argument instead of the first to the `nfcall` function.

DONE.
