  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function expects a string as its input, but `spec` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function expects a string as its input, but `spec.toString()` returns a string representation of the object, which may not be in the same format as the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(JSON.stringify(spec))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function returns a JSON representation of the object, which may not be in the same format as the original string.

DONE.
