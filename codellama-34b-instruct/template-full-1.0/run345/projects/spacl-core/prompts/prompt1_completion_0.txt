  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the Regex match now returns a Boolean value instead of a null or an empty string, which may affect the logic of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because now the Regex match always returns a non-null value, which may affect the logic of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== ""
```
This would result in different behavior because now the Regex match always returns a non-empty string, which may affect the logic of the surrounding code.

DONE.
