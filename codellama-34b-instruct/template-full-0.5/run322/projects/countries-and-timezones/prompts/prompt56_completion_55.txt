  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[0], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first timezone object in the `timezones` array, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.slice(1), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first timezone object in the `timezones` array, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass timezone objects that have the `deprecated` property set to `true`, rather than all of them.

DONE.
