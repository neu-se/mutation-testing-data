  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryName, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `countryName` is a string representing the name of a country, while `countryId` is a number representing the unique identifier of a country. Using `countryName` instead of `countryId` would cause the function to return a different country, which could be a bug or a feature depending on the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.toString(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` converts the `countryId` number to a string, which would cause the function to return a different country, as `countryName` is a string and `countryId` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+countryId, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` is the unary plus operator, and it converts its operand to a number. In this case, it would convert `countryId` to a number, which could result in a
