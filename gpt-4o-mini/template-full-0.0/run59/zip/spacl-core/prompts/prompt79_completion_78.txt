Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from `matches` to `query`, which may not have the same logic or return values, potentially leading to incorrect results regarding whether the path is governed by the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `matches` method, meaning that if a rule matches the path, it would incorrectly indicate that it does not, leading to false negatives in path governance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches('differentPath', ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks against a hardcoded string `'differentPath'` instead of the variable `path`, which would cause the method to always evaluate against a specific path rather than the one provided, potentially missing valid matches.

DONE.
