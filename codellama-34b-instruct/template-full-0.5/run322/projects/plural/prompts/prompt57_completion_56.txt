  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to replace the last letter of the word with "ves", while this code fragment would replace the entire word with "ves".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/y$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to replace the last letter of the word with "ves", while this code fragment would replace the last letter of the word with "ves" regardless of its position in the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to replace the last letter of the word with "ves", while this code fragment would replace the last letter of the word with "ves" only if it is preceded by "ves".

DONE.
