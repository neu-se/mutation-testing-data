  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat the error as an access error, rather than a file not found error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat the error as an invalid directory error, rather than a file not found error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EPERM'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to treat the error as a permission error, rather than a file not found error.

DONE.
