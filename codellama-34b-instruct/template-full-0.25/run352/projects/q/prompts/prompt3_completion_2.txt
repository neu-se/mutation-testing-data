  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deferred"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` property is used to create a new promise object, while the `deferred` property is used to create a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` property is used to create a new promise object, while the `fulfilled` property is used to create a new fulfilled promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` property is used to create a new promise object, while the `rejected` property is used to create a new rejected promise object.

DONE.
