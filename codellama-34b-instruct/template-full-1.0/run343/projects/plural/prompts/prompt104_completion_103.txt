  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word plus "s" regardless of whether the word already ends with "s."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substring(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word minus its last letter, rather than returning the word unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word in uppercase, rather than returning the word unchanged.

DONE.
