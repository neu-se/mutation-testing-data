  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the divisor is infinite, rather than the dividend.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the dividend is infinite, rather than the divisor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the dividend is infinite, rather than the divisor.

DONE.
