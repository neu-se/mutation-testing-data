  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current operation is a `retain` operation rather than a `delete` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current operation is not a `delete` operation rather than a `delete` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete !== length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the current operation is not equal to the length of the `delete` operation, which is not the same as checking if the operation is a `delete` operation.

DONE.
