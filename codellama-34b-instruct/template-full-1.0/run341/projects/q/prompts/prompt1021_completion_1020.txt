  Sure, here are three possible options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.dispatch()` method with the `name` argument only, instead of both `name` and `nodeArgs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[Q.resolve(name)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.dispatch()` method with the resolved value of `name` instead of the original `name` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.dispatch()` method with the uppercase version of the `name` argument, which could produce a different result.

DONE.
