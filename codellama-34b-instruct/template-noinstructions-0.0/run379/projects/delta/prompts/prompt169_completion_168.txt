  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the composed delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation in the other delta, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the composed delta to include a null operation, which would likely cause errors when the delta is applied to a document.

DONE.
