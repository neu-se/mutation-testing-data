  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\s+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of substrings, separated by whitespace, whereas the original code fragment would split the `src` string into an array of substrings, separated by the specified separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\s+/, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of at most two substrings, separated by whitespace, whereas the original code fragment would split the `src` string into an array of substrings, separated by the specified separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(/\s+/, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of at most three substrings, separated by whitespace, whereas the original code fragment would split the `src` string into an array of substrings
