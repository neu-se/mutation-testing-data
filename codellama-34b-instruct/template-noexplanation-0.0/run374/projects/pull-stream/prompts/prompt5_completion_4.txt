  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.map(function(through) { return through.toUpperCase(); })
```
This code fragment will replace the original `throughs` variable with an array of uppercase strings, which will cause the `for` loop to iterate over the uppercase strings instead of the original `throughs` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.filter(function(through) { return through.length > 0; })
```
This code fragment will replace the original `throughs` variable with an array of `through` objects that have a length greater than 0, which will cause the `for` loop to iterate over a subset of the original `throughs` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reduce(function(acc, through) { return acc + through.length; }, 0)
```
This code fragment will replace the original `throughs` variable with the sum of the lengths of all the `through` objects in
