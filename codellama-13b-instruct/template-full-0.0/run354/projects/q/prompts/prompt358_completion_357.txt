  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `progressed` function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `progressed` function with a typo. This would cause the `tap` method to throw an error when it tries to call the `progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `progressed` function, while the buggy code fragment is a call to the `progressed` function. This would cause the `tap` method to call the `progressed` function immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.call(this, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `progressed` function, while the buggy code fragment is a call to the
