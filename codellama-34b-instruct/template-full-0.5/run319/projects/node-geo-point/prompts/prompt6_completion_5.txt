  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the coordinates of the point, whereas the original code fragment returned the point itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the point, whereas the original code fragment returned the point itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first coordinate of the point, whereas the original code fragment returned the point itself.

DONE.
