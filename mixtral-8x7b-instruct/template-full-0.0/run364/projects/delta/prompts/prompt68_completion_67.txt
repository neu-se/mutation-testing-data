 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than intended, potentially causing the resulting string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ delete: Math.floor(length) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round down when deleting, potentially causing the resulting string to be incorrect if `length` is a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ delete: 'length' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `length` as a string and attempt to delete that string of characters, rather than the intended number of characters.

DONE.
