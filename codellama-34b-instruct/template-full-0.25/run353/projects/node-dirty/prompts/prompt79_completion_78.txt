  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is not emitted when an error occurs, so the `error` event would not be handled correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is not emitted when an error occurs, so the `error` event would not be handled correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not emitted when the `drain` event occurs, so the `drain` event would not be handled correctly.

DONE.
