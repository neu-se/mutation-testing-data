 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `hasNext` method, consuming the iterator's state, whereas the original code fragment checks if the method exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter['hasNext']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `hasNext` property as if it were an object property instead of invoking it as a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.hasNext
