 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event is being replaced with the 'warn' event, which has a different severity level and may not trigger error handling in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'customError'
