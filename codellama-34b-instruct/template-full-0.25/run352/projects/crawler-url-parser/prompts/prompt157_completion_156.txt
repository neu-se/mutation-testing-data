  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, while `replace` returns a new string with the replacements made.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a subset of the original string, while `replace` returns a new string with the replacements made.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, while `replace` returns a new string with the replacements made.

DONE.
