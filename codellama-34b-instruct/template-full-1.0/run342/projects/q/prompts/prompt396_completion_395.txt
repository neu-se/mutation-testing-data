  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```value```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `value` object instead of an arrow function that returns `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```() => "foo"```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that returns the string "foo" instead of an arrow function that returns `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```(bar) => bar```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that returns the `bar` argument instead of an arrow function that returns `value`.

DONE.
