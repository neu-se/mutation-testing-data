  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosh function would be computing the hyperbolic cosine of x+1 instead of x, which would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the sinh function would be computing the hyperbolic sine of x-1 instead of x, which would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the sinh function would be computing the hyperbolic sine of -x instead of x, which would produce a different output.

DONE.
