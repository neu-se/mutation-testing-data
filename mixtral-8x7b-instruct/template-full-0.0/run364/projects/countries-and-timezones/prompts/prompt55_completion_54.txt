 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `options` variable is replaced with `null`, the `deliverTimezones` function will not filter out deprecated timezones, and it will return all timezones regardless of their deprecation status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `options` variable is replaced with an empty object, the `deliverTimezones` function will not filter out deprecated timezones, and it will return all timezones regardless of their deprecation status.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `options` variable is replaced with `options.filter`, the code will throw a `TypeError` since `options` is an object and does not have a `filter` method.

DONE.
