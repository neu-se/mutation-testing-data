Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value instead of resolving it, leading to a failure state instead of a success state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` instead of the intended value, which may not be the expected outcome for the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, which could lead to confusion or errors in the handling of the resolved value, as it is not the same as resolving with a valid value.

DONE.
