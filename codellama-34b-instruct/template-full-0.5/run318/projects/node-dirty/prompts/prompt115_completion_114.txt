  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the size of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the size of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the size of the data.

DONE.
