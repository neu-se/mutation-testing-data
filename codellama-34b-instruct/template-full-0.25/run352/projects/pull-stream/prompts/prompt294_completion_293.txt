  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(err || true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is now being checked before the `cb` function is called, which could cause the `terminate` function to be called unnecessarily.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(err || true) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is now being checked after the `cb` function is called, which could cause the `terminate` function to be called unnecessarily.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(err || true) : cb(err || true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is now being checked twice, which could cause the `cb` function to be called twice unnecessarily.

DONE.
