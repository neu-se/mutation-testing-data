  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the string `text` is a substring of `tmpUrl.text`, whereas the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `tmpUrl.text` is equal to `text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the string `text` in `tmpUrl.text`, whereas the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `tmpUrl.text` is equal to `text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method checks if the string `text` matches the regular expression `tmpUrl.text`, whereas the original code fragment uses the `===`
