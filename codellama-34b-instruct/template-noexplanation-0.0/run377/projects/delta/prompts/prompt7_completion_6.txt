  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key]
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return a new object with the same keys as `attributes`, but with the values of `attributes[key]` instead of `attributes`. This will likely cause the `diff` method to return a different result than it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes)
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return a new object with the same keys as `attributes`, but with the values of `Object.keys(attributes)` instead of `attributes`. This will likely cause the `diff` method to return a different result than it would with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes)
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return a new object with the same keys as `attributes`, but with the values of `Object.values(attributes)` instead of `attributes`. This will likely cause the `diff
