  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.call` is a different method than `call.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when calling the function with a specific `this` value and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and arguments, whereas `call.apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind(null)` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a `this` value of `null` and the specified arguments, whereas `call.apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments.

DONE.
