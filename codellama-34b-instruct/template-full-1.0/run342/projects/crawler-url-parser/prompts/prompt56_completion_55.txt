  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse = function (currentUrlStr) { return URL.parse(currentUrlStr); }
```
This would result in an infinite loop, as the parse function calls itself with the same argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse = function (currentUrlStr) { return; }
```
This would result in the parse function always returning undefined, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse = function (currentUrlStr) { throw new Error('Invalid URL'); }
```
This would result in the parse function always throwing an error, regardless of the input.

DONE.
