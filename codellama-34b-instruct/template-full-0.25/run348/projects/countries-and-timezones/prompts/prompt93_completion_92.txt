  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated` is a different value than `options` and would change the logic of the `deliverCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `true`, which would change the logic of the `deliverCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `false`, which would change the logic of the `deliverCountry` function.

DONE.
