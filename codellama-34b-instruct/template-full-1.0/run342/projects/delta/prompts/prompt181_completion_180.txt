  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `otherIter` by one step, potentially skipping the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the `thisIter` by one step, potentially skipping the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation without advancing the `otherIter`.

DONE.
