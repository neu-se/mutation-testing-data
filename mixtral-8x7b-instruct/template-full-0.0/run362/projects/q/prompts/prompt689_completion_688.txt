 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apPLY"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison for the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the `fcall` method to always return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"applyProp"
