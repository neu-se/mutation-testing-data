Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `null` when checking if the value is a promise, instead of returning the actual value, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the function returning `undefined` instead of the fulfilled value of the promise, which could cause downstream consumers of the promise to receive an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not a promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the input as a string rather than checking if it is a promise, which would bypass the promise inspection logic and always return the string, leading to incorrect handling of promise states.

DONE.
