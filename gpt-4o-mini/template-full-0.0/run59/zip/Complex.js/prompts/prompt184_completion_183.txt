Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return a complex number when `b` is not zero, even if `a` is positive, which is not the intended logic of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to return a complex number when `a` is negative, which contradicts the original condition that requires `a` to be positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 || a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to return a complex number if either `b` is zero or `a` is positive, which broadens the condition and may lead to incorrect results when `b` is not zero and `a` is not positive.

DONE.
