  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).someOtherMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because someOtherMethod is a different method than dispatch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because dispatch is called as a method on the object, not on the promise returned by Q(object).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because resolve is called on the Q promise, not on the object.

DONE.
