  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. In this case, the function would return a resolved promise instead of a rejected promise, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(null)` creates a rejected promise with a `null` reason, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise with no reason. In this case, the function would return a rejected promise with a `null` reason, which could cause the calling code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Some other error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(new Error('Some other error'))` creates a rejected promise with a
