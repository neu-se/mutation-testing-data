  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, rather than being fulfilled with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Intentional rejection");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, rather than being fulfilled with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Intentional fulfillment");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a specific value, rather than being rejected with an error.

DONE.
