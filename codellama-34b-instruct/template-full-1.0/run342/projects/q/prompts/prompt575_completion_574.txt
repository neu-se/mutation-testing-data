  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` will return the string representation of the `bind` function, which is not what the original code expects as the second argument to `Q.async`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` will call the `bind` function immediately, which is not what the original code expects as the second argument to `Q.async`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply()` will call the `bind` function immediately with the arguments specified as an array, which is not what the original code expects as the second argument to `Q.async`.

DONE.
