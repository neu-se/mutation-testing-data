  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always add 1 to the length of the `nodeArgs` array, while the new code fragment `0` would not modify the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always add 1 to the length of the `nodeArgs` array, while the new code fragment `2` would add 2 to the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` would always add 1 to the length of the `nodeArgs` array, while the new code fragment `-1` would subtract 1 from the length of the array.

DONE.
