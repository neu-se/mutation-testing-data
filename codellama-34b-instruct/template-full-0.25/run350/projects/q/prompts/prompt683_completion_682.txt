  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall` function expects a promise or an immediate reference for the target function, but `null` is not a valid function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall` function expects a promise or an immediate reference for the target function, but `undefined` is not a valid function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fcall` function expects a promise or an immediate reference for the target function, but `0` is not a valid function.

DONE.
