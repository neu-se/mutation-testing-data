  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array containing the elements from the original array from a specified start index to the end of the array, while the original code fragment `rest` returns the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.filter(op => op.delete !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing the elements from the original array that pass a test implemented by the provided function, while the original code fragment `rest` returns the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.map(op => op.delete ? op : { delete: 0 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array, while the original code fragment `rest` returns the entire array.

DONE.
