 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment just passes through the original resolution value, while this change would return a resolved promise with the original value incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.fcall(value).thenReject(value);
