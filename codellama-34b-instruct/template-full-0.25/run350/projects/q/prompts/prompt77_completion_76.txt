  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that repeatedly calls a given function with a fixed time delay between each call, whereas `setTimeout` is a function that calls a given function after a fixed delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, 1)` would call the `flush` function after a delay of 1 millisecond, whereas `setTimeout(flush, 0)` would call the `flush` function as soon as possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, -1)` would call the `flush` function after a delay of -1 millisecond, which would be a negative delay and would likely result in the `flush` function being called immediately.

DONE.
