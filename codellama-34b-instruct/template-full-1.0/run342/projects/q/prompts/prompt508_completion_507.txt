  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `.call()` and `.apply()` are both methods that can be used to call a function with a specific `this` value, but `.call()` requires the arguments to be passed individually, while `.apply()` requires the arguments to be passed as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind()` returns a new function that, when called, will have a specific `this` value and arguments, while `.apply()` and `.call()` will call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because this will create a new function that will not have the same `this` value or arguments as the `value` function.

DONE.
