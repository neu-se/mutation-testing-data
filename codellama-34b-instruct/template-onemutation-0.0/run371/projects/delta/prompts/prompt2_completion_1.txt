  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` is a different condition than `typeof b !== 'object'`. The original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it an object, while the new code would not.

DONE.
