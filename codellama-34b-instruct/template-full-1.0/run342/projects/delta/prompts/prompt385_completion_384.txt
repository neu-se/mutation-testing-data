  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>otherIter.peekLength() + 1</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator is incremented, which may cause the transformation to delete or retain one more operation than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>otherIter.peekLength() - 1</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator is decremented, which may cause the transformation to delete or retain one fewer operation than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>0</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator is always zero, which may cause the transformation to delete or retain no operations.

DONE.
