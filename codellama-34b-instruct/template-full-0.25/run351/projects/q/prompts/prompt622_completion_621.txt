  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `set` method to assign the wrong value to the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is incremented by 1, which could cause unexpected behavior if the value is used in a calculation or comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "new value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is a string, which could cause unexpected behavior if the value is used in a calculation or comparison.

DONE.
