  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "internal")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return "internal", regardless of the actual type of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "external")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return "external", regardless of the actual type of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "samelevel")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return "samelevel", regardless of the actual type of the link.

DONE.
