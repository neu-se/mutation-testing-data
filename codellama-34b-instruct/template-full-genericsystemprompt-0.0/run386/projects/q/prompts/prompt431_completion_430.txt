  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.bind(this)` would return a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.inspect` would return the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.call(this)` would call the `inspect` method with `this` as the context, whereas `this.inspect` would return the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.apply(this)` would call the `inspect` method with `this` as the context and an empty argument list, whereas `this.inspect` would return the original function.

DONE.
