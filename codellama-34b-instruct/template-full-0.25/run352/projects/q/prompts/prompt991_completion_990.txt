  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the first element of the `arguments` object instead of the second, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to include the `name` argument instead of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third element of the `arguments` object instead of the second, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to include the `args` array instead of the `name` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the first element of the `arguments` object instead of the second, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to include the `name` argument instead of the `args` array.

DONE.
