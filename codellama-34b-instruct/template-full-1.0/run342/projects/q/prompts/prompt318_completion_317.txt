  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.toString = function () {
    return "[object Promise Mutant]";
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method has changed, which would affect how the object is represented as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.valueOf = function () {
    var inspected = inspect();
    if (inspected.state === "pending" ||
        inspected.state === "rejected") {
        return promise;
    }
    return "I've been mutated!";
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method has changed, which would affect how the object is coerced to a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.promiseDispatch = function (resolve, op, args) {
    var result;
    try {
        if (descriptor[op]) {
            result = descriptor[op
