  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` event to be called with the `'error'` argument, which would trigger any error handlers that have been registered for the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 'foo'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` event to be called with the `'drain'` argument and the string `'foo'` as the second argument. This would trigger any event handlers that have been registered for the `'drain'` event with the string `'foo'` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 42); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` event to be called with
