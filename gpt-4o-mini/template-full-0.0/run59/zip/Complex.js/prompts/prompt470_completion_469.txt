Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is greater than 1 instead of checking if `b` is not equal to 1, which would lead to incorrect string representation for complex numbers with imaginary parts that are equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is exactly 0, which would cause the imaginary part to be omitted in the string representation even when `b` is a non-zero value, leading to incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares `b` to the imaginary part of the current complex number instead of checking if `b` is not equal to 1, which could lead to incorrect string representation based on the current object's state rather than the value of `b`.

DONE.
