  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate the second capturing group of the regular expression, which is the line number, instead of the third capturing group, which is the column number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate the third capturing group of the regular expression, which is the column number, instead of the second capturing group, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate the third capturing group of the regular expression, which is the function name, instead of the second capturing group, which is the line number.

DONE.
