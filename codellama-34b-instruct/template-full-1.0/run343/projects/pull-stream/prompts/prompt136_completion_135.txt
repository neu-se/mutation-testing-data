  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `err`, which means that the function will not return an error, even if one is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `err`, which means that the function will not return an error, even if one is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('example')
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error('example')` creates a new Error object with the message 'example', which is not the same as `err`, which means that the function will not return an error, even if one is provided.

DONE.
