  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that is called when the stream is aborted, while `cb` is a function that is called when the stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error when called, while `cb` is a function that is called when the stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, while `cb` is a function that is called when the stream is closed.

DONE.
