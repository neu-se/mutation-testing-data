  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `abort` parameter is truthy, whereas this modified code fragment calls `cb` unconditionally, which could cause the stream to error even if the `abort` parameter is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, whereas this modified code fragment calls `cb` with two arguments, which could cause the stream to behave differently if the `cb` function is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with the `err` argument first, whereas this modified code fragment calls `cb` with the `err` argument second, which could cause the
