  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that `atReport` must be not only not equal to `-1`, but also not of the same type. In this case, `atReport` is an integer, and `-1` is an integer, so the condition would always be true, even if `atReport` is actually equal to `-1`.
