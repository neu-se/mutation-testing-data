  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a local variable that refers to the current promise, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a local variable that refers to the current promise, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a local variable that refers to the current promise, while `this` refers to the current execution context, which may be different from the current promise.

DONE.
