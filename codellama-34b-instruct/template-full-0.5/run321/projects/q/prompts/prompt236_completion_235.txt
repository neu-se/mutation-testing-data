  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` object, which is different from the original code that called the method on the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
