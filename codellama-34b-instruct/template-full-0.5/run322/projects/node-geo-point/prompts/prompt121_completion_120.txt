  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be double the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) - 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be 360 degrees off from the correct value.

DONE.
