  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in an array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

DONE.
