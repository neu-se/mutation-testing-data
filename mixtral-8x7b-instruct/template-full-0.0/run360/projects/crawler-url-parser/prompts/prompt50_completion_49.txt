 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://' + parsedBaseUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the absolute URL by concatenating the base URL's host with the parsed URL's path, instead of using the `URL.resolve` method which takes care of resolving the relative URL against the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.format({ ...parsedBaseUrl, pathname: parsedUrl.path })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object by spreading the `parsedBaseUrl` object and replacing its `pathname` property with the `parsedUrl.path`, instead of using the `URL.resolve` method which handles relative URL resolution more accurately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedBaseUrl.protocol + '//' + parsedBaseUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
