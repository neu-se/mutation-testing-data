  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if the value at the current index plus one is not equal to the property, while this new code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if the value at the current index plus one is equal to the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is not undefined or if the value at the current index plus one is not equal to the property, while this new code fragment checks if the property is not undefined or if the value at the current index plus one is equal to the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined or if
