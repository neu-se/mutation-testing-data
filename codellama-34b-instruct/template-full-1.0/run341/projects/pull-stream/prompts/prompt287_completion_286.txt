  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the `data` value, while the new code fragment always returns `null`, which is a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the `data` value, while the new code fragment always returns `undefined`, which is a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of the `mapper` function called on the `data` value, while the new code fragment returns the result of the `mapper` function called on the `data` value, plus 1. This would cause the test to fail if the `mapper` function is not idempotent, meaning that it does not always return the same result for the same input.

DONE.
