  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
a === 0 && b === 0 && z.re > 0 && z.im <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is greater than or equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `b` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] < 0 && z['im'] >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is less than 0.
