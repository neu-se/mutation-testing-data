  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, options)
```
This code fragment is a function call that retrieves a country object from the `countries` object, using the `countryId` as the key. The `options` parameter is an optional object that can be used to specify additional options for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[countryId]
```
This code fragment is a direct reference to the `countries` object, using the `countryId` as the key. This is equivalent to the previous code fragment, but it does not call the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true })
```
This code fragment is a function call that retrieves a country object from the `countries` object, using the `countryId` as the key. The `options` parameter is an object that specifies the `deprecated` option as `true`. This will return a country object
