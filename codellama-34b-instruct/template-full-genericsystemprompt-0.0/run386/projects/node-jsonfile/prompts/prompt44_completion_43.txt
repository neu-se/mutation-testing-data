  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function that is called for each key-value pair in the JSON object, and it can modify the value of the key-value pair. In the original code, `options.reviver` is not used, so the JSON object is not modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a string that specifies the encoding of the file, and it can affect how the JSON object is parsed. In the original code, `options.encoding` is not used, so the JSON object is parsed using the default encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a boolean that specifies whether an error should be thrown if the file cannot be read. In the original code, `options.throws
