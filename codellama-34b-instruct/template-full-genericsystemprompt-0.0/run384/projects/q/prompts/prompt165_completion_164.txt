  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not iterate at all, potentially causing the program to hang.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, potentially causing the program to miss some lines.

DONE.
