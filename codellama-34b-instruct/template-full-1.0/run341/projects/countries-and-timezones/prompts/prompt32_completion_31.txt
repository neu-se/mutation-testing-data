  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(-num)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `input`, while the modified code uses the negated value of `input`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `input`, while the modified code uses twice the value of `input`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `input`, while the modified code uses `input - 1`.

DONE.
