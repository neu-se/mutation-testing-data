  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for null or undefined, while this code only checks for undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for any falsy value, while this code only checks for the boolean value false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for any falsy value, while this code only checks for the number 0.

DONE.
