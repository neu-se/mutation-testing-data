  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/./, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z]/, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]/, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different.

DONE.
