 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be the second argument, but passing `null` would change the behavior of the function by setting `thisp` to the global object (`window` in a browser environment).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be the second argument, but passing `0` would change the behavior of the function by setting `thisp` to the global object (`window` in a browser environment) due to type coercion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function expects `thisp` to be the second argument, but passing a function would change the behavior of the function by setting `thisp` to the function itself.
