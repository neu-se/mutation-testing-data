Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with no callback function, instead of providing a Node-style callback resolver, which is necessary for handling the asynchronous nature of Node-style functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately instead of resolving, which would lead to an error being thrown instead of executing the intended callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a function that returns `null` instead of a proper Node-style callback resolver, which would break the expected behavior of the promise handling in Node-style functions.

DONE.
