 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would incorrectly handle 'insert' operations, potentially causing unexpected insertions or offset changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would incorrectly handle 'delete' operations, potentially causing unexpected deletions or offset changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(length, index - offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would incorrectly calculate the index when handling 'delete' operations, potentially causing unexpected deletions or offset changes.

By introducing these changes, the test suite may not catch the differences in behavior, indicating potential weaknesses in the test coverage.

DONE.
