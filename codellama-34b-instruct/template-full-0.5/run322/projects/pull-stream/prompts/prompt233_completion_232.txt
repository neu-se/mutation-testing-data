  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end` or `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates both operands and returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy, otherwise it returns the first operand. In this case, if `test` is truthy, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end` or `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates both operands and returns the first operand if it is truthy, otherwise it returns the second operand. In this case, if `test` is falsy,
