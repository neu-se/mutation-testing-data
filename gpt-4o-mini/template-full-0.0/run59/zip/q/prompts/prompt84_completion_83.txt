Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 100);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delay before the `flush` function is called from 0 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds, potentially causing tasks to be executed later than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { flush(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls `flush()` instead of scheduling it to run asynchronously, which could lead to immediate execution and potentially block the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { setTimeout(flush, -1); };
```
This would result in different behavior because setting a timeout with a negative delay is effectively treated as 0 milliseconds in most environments, but it could lead to unexpected behavior in some implementations, potentially causing `flush` to be called immediately or not at all.

DONE.
