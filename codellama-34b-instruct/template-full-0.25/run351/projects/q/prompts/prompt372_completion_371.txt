  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `Q.onerror` function with a no-op function, which would prevent the original error handling logic from being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `Q.onerror` function with a function that throws the error, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { return error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `Q.onerror` function with a function that returns the error, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the error instead of being rejected.

DONE.
