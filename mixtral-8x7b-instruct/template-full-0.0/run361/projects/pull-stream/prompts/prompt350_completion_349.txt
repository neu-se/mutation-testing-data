 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `prop` variable with an arrow function, changing the context in which `prop` is evaluated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `prop` variable with a null value, causing the expression to always return `null` instead of the value of `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `prop` variable with the integer value `1`, causing the expression to always return `1` instead of the value of `prop`.

DONE.
