  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now references the second capture group instead of the first, which would cause the regex to match and replace the wrong part of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now references the entire match instead of the first capture group, which would cause the regex to match and replace the wrong part of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string now references the first capture group instead of the entire match, which would cause the regex to match and replace the wrong part of the string.

DONE.
