 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null equality instead of checking if the value is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.constructor.name !== 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name instead of using the 'function' keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'typeof' keyword with a different syntax.

DONE.
