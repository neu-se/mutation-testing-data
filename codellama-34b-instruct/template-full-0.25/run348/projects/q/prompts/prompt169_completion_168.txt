  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isExternalFrame` is a different function than `isInternalFrame`, and it would not filter out internal frames from the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a different function than `isInternalFrame`, and it would not filter out internal frames from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, causing the `if` statement to always be skipped, and the stack trace would not be filtered.

DONE.
