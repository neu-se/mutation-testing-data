  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a - b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the difference of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is equivalent to the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
