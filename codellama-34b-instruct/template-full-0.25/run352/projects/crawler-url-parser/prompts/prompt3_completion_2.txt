  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr === 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this replacement checks if it is null. If `currentUrlStr` is null, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to true, while the original code fragment would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this replacement checks if it is null. If `currentUrlStr` is null, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to true, while the original code fragment would evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrlStr` is undefined, but this replacement checks if it is null or undefined. If `currentUrlStr` is null or undefined, the replacement code fragment will
