  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This change will cause the `nbind` method to use the second argument instead of the first one, which may cause unexpected behavior if the function being bound expects the first argument to be a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This change will cause the `nbind` method to use the last argument instead of the first one, which may cause unexpected behavior if the function being bound expects the first argument to be a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, "foo"
```
This change will cause the `nbind` method to use the argument with the key "foo" instead of the first argument, which may cause unexpected behavior if the function being bound expects the first argument to be a specific value.

DONE.
