  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be increased by 1, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` variable would be decreased by 1, which would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

DONE.
