  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the value passed to it, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the given reason. If the placeholder is replaced with `_fulfilled`, the promise will be resolved with the exception object instead of being rejected with it, which could cause issues in the code that handles the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected("different reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because `_re
