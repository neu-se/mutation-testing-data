  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings, and the rest of the code assumes that the `linkurl_path` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method with a space separator would return an array of strings, where each string is a word in the original `linkurl_path` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace("/", " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of the forward slash "/" character with a space character, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

DONE.
