  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the data passed to the callback, while `null` returns a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the data passed to the callback, while `undefined` returns an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the data passed to the callback, while `0` returns a zero value.

DONE.
