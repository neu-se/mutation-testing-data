  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called immediately instead of being passed as an argument to the wrapper function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to the `cb` function, which would cause it to return `true` instead of the expected value from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array[i++]` expression would increase the value of `i` and return the value of `array[i]` instead of the expected value from the array.

DONE.
