  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the conditional statement to always be true, even when the value is not a promise, which would lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the conditional statement to always be false, even when the value is a promise, which would lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(value).then(notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `notify` function to be called repeatedly, even when the value is not a promise, which would lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
