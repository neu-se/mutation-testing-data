  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regex to match only lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regex to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, causing the regex to match multiple lines.

DONE.
