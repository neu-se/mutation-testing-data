  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable, while `acc + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `acc`. This change would cause the `reducer` function to receive a different value than it was originally intended to receive, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable, while `acc * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of `acc` by 2. This change would cause the `reducer` function to receive a different value than it was originally intended to receive, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable, while `acc.length` is a property
