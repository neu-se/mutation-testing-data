  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a function that checks if a value is NaN, whereas `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a property that represents the imaginary part of the complex number, and `!==` is a comparison operator that checks if the imaginary part is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, and `> Complex['EPSILON']` is a comparison operator that checks if the absolute value of the imaginary part is greater than a small positive value (EPSILON).

DONE.
