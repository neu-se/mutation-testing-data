  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference between the two longitudes, which is necessary for the calculation of the bearing. Adding 180 to the difference would result in an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference between the two longitudes, which is necessary for the calculation of the bearing. Multiplying the difference by 2 would result in an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference between the two longitudes, which is necessary for the calculation of the bearing. Subtracting 180 from the difference would result in an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
