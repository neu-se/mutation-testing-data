Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate immediately, preventing any operations from being processed, which could lead to unexpected results in the returned `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue beyond the intended `end` index, potentially accessing out-of-bounds elements and leading to runtime errors or incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if there are more operations based on the difference between `start` and `index`, which could skip valid operations that should be processed, leading to incomplete results in the `Delta`.

DONE.
