  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null` or `void 0`, and the `post` method would behave differently when the `name` parameter is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string `"undefined"` is a different value than `undefined`, and the `post` method would behave differently when the `name` parameter is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion, and `null` is converted to `undefined`, so the check would evaluate to `true` for both `null` and `undefined`, which is different from the original code.

DONE.
