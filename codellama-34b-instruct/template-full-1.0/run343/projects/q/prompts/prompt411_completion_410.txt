  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f(x) { return x >= 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comparator function that checks if a number is greater than or equal to zero, while this new function is a binary function that returns the number that is passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f(x) { return x >> 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comparator function that checks if a number is greater than or equal to zero, while this new function is a binary function that shifts the bits of the number that is passed to it to the right by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f(x) { return x * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comparator function that checks if a number is greater than or equal to zero, while this new function is a binary function that multip
