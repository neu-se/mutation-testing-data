  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && !this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is added before `this.verbs[verb]`, which would cause the `query` method to return `true` if the action is explicitly denied, rather than `false` if the action is explicitly allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && this.verbs[verb] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is added to check if the value of `this.verbs[verb]` is `false`, rather than checking if the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && this.verbs[verb] !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is added to check if the value of `this.verbs[verb]` is not `true
