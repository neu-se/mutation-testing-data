  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator increments the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator combines the `end` value with the `false` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `end` is `true`.

DONE.
