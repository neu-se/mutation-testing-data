  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("DIFFERENT ERROR MESSAGE")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would change, therefore the behavior of the rest of the code that depends on the error message would also change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with the value that was passed to the rejection callback, instead of throwing an error. This would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value that was passed to the rejection callback, instead of being rejected with the error that was originally thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("NEW ERROR MESSAGE")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would change, therefore the behavior of the rest of the code that depends on the error message would also change.

DONE.
