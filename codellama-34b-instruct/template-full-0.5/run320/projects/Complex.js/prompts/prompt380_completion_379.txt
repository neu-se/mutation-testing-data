  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but `b * b` is a multiplication operation that would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but `a + b` is an addition operation that would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but `a - b` is a subtraction operation that would result in a different value.

DONE.
