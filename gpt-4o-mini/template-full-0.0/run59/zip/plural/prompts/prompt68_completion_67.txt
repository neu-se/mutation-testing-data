Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "memo" is incorrectly changed to "memoes" instead of the correct "memos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoss'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form is incorrectly altered by adding an extra 's', resulting in "memoss" instead of "memos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the singular form "memo" instead of the plural "memos", which is incorrect for pluralization.

DONE.
