  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos()` and `Math.sin()` have different outputs for the same input, so the final result of the function would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan()` and `Math.sin()` have different outputs for the same input, so the final result of the function would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin()` and `Math.sin()` have different outputs for the same input, so the final result of the function would be different.

DONE.
