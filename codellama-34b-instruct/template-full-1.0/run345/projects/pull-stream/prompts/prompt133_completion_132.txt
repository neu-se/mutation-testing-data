  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream should be aborted, while `cb` is a function that is called with the chunk of data. In the original code, the function returns the chunk of data, but the modified code would return the boolean value `abort` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while the modified code calls it with two arguments, `null` and `true`. This would cause the `cb` function to behave differently, even if it is called in the same context as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while the modified code calls it with two arguments, `undefined` and
