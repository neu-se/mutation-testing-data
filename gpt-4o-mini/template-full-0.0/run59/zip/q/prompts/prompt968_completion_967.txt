Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` changes the first argument passed to `Q.nbind`, which may affect how the bound function behaves, particularly in terms of context (`this` value) when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because appending an additional argument (`1`) to `args` changes the number of arguments passed to the bound function, potentially altering its execution and output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `void 0` is semantically similar but can lead to different handling in some contexts, and slicing `args` to only include the first argument changes the input to the bound function.

DONE.
