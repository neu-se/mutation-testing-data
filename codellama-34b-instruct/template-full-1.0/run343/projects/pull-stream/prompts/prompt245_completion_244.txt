  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && err
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` has higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && err) || abort`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? err : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort ? err : abort` is a ternary expression that evaluates to `err` if `abort` is true, and `abort` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ? abort : abort` is a ternary expression that evaluates to `abort` if `err` is true, and `abort` otherwise.

DONE.
