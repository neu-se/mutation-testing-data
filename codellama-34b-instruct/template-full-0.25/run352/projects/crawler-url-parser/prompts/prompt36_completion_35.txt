  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, and the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement would not be executed if the `parsedUrl.hash` property is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hash != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement would not be executed if the `parsedUrl.hash` property is null or undefined.

DONE.
