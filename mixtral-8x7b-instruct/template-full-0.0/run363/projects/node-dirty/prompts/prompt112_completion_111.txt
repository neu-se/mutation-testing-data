 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message no longer includes the `buffer` content, which might make it harder to diagnose issues related to the contents of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error', () => new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error constructor is now wrapped in an anonymous function, which would prevent the error message from including the original error stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'warn', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the log level is changed from 'error' to 'warn', which might cause developers to overlook the issue, as warnings are generally considered less severe than errors.

DONE.
