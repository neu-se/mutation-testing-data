  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `urlMap` entry for `currentUrl.url` to an empty object, instead of the `currentUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `urlMap` entry for `currentUrl.url` to the `currentUrl.url` string, instead of the `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `urlMap` entry for `currentUrl.url` to `null`, instead of the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
