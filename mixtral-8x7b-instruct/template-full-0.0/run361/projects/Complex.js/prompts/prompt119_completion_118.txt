 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(this['re']) + Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the taxicab norm instead of the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['im']
