  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of the `_writeFile` function, and it does not return a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileAsync` is an asynchronous version of the `_writeFile` function, and it returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileCallback` is a callback-based version of the `_writeFile` function, and it does not return a promise.

DONE.
