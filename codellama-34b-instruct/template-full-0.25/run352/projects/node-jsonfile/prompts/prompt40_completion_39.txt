  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. The former takes a callback function as its second argument, while the latter takes a promise as its second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise.bind(null)` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. The former is a bound function, while the latter is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise.bind(null, fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise.bind(null, fs.readFile)` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`. The former is a bound function with a specific context
