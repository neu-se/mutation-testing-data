  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `i++` is a post-increment operator, meaning that the value of `i` is returned before it is incremented, whereas `++i` is a pre-increment operator, meaning that the value of `i` is incremented before it is returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i += 1` is an assignment operator, meaning that the value of `i` is incremented and then returned, whereas `++i` is a pre-increment operator, meaning that the value of `i` is incremented before it is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i = i + 1` is an assignment operator, meaning that the value of `i` is incremented and then returned, whereas `++i` is a pre-increment operator,
