  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI - a` would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

DONE.
