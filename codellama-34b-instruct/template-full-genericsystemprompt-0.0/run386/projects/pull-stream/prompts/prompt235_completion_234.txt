  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without calling the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, function (end, data) {
  cb(end, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with a different callback function, which would cause the `cb` function to be called with different arguments.

DONE.
