  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only included the `games` array, while the new code fragment includes both the `games` and `clothes` arrays. The `clothes` array is not included in the original code fragment, which means that the new code fragment would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
