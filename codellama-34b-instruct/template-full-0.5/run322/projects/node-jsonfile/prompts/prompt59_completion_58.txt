  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `\n` character to match line breaks, while the new code fragment uses the `\r` character. This would cause the `stringify` function to produce different output for inputs with `\r` characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `\n` character to match line breaks, while the new code fragment uses the `\r\n` sequence to match line breaks. This would cause the `stringify` function to produce different output for inputs with `\r\n` sequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` variable to determine the line break character, while the new code fragment uses the `\r` character directly. This would cause the
