  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.length```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine` is a string, and `stackLine.length` is equal to the number of characters in `stackLine`, which is not the same as `stackLine` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.toLowerCase()```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine` is a string, and `stackLine.toLowerCase()` is a lowercase version of `stackLine`, which is not the same as `stackLine` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```stackLine.split(" ")```
This would result in different behavior because `stackLine` is a string, and `stackLine.split(" ")` is an array of substrings split by spaces, which is not the same as `stackLine` itself.

DONE.
