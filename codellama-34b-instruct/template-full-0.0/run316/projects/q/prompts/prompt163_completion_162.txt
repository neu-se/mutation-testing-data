  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into separate lines, making it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the line breaks from the stack trace, making it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the newline character, making it more difficult to read and understand.

DONE.
