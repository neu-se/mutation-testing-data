  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` argument would be missing, which could cause the event to be emitted with incorrect information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` argument would be duplicated, which could cause the event to be emitted with incorrect information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise, reason, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` argument would be duplicated, which could cause the event to be emitted with incorrect information.

DONE.
