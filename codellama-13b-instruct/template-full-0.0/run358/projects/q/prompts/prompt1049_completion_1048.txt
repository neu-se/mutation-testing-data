  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function is called with a new `Error` object, which would cause the `get` method to reject with that error instead of the original `error` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function is called with the `error` variable, which would cause the `get` method to reject with that error instead of the original `error` variable.
