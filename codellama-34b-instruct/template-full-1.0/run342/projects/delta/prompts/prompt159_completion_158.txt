  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstLeft` is initially set to the length of the first insert operation in `other` delta. But if we replace this with `let firstLeft = firstOther.delete;`, it will set `firstLeft` to the length of the first delete operation in `other` delta, which will change the behavior of the algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let firstLeft = firstOther.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstLeft` is initially set to the length of the first insert operation in `other` delta. But if we replace this with `let firstLeft = firstOther.delete;`, it will set `firstLeft` to the length of the first delete operation in `other` delta, which will change the behavior of the algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	let firstLeft = firstOther.retain;
```
This would
