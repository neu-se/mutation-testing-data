  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for `undefined` and `null`, but this new code fragment also checks for `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for `undefined` and `null`, but this new code fragment also checks for `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === -Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for `undefined` and `null`, but this new code fragment also checks for `-Infinity`.

DONE.
