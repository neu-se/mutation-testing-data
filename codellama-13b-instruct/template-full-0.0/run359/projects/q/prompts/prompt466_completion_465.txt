  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not be updated, and the `process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);` line would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport !== -1 && atReport !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be updated, and the `process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);` line would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport !== -1 && atReport !== 0 && atReport !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would be updated, and the `process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);` line would be executed.
