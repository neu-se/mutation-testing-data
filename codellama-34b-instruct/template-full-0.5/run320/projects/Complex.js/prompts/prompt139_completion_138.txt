  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checked if `this` was infinite, while the new code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `this` was infinite and `z` was not infinite, while the new code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() ^ z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `this` was infinite and `z` was not infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite, or vice versa.

DONE
