Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0 && a >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `b` is not equal to zero and `a` is greater than or equal to zero, which would allow the log function to return a complex number even when `b` is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 || a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, allowing the condition to be true if either `b` is zero or `a` is less than zero, which would lead to a different execution path in the log function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if both `a` and `b` are exactly zero, which would prevent the log function from returning a complex number for positive values of `a` and `b`, leading to potential errors in calculations.

DONE.
