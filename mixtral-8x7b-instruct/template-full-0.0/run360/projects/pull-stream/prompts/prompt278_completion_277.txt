 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `mapper` is explicitly set to `null`, whereas the original code checks if `mapper` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof mapper === 'undefined'
