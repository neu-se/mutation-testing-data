  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2, baseIndex + length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the slice to include twice the number of characters that it should, and the division by 2 would cause the slice to include half the number of characters that it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition would cause the slice to include extra characters beyond the original string, and the subtraction would cause the slice to include characters that are not present in the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition by 1 would cause the slice to include an extra character that it should not, and the addition by length + 1 would cause the slice to include an extra character that it should not.

DONE.
