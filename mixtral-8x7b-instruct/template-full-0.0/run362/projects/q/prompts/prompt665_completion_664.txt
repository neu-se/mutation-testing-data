 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method expects an array-like object, and an empty array is a valid one. However, the empty array does not contain the arguments passed to the function, so the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method expects an array-like object, and `null` is not an array-like object. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown, changing the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method expects an array-like object, and an empty object is not an array-like object. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown, changing the behavior of the code.

In general, changing the PLACEHOLDER to any value that is not an array-
