  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.filter` is a function that creates a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `Array.from` is a function that creates a new array from an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the variable `retArr` from an array to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the array with a string, and the string does not have an iterator method.

DONE.
