  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second to last op in the ops array, rather than the last op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first op in the ops array, rather than the last op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first op in the other Delta's ops array, rather than the last op of the current Delta.

DONE.
