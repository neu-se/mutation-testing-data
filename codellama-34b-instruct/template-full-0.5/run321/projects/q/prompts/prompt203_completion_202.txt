  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the format of the stack trace, potentially causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to fail to extract the file name and line number correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the format of the stack trace, potentially causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to fail to extract the file name and line number correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"&"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the format of the stack trace, potentially causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to fail to extract the file name and line number correctly.

DONE.
