  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, while `indexOf` checks if the element is present at the given index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` checks if the array has any elements, while `indexOf` checks if the element is present at the given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, while `!includes` checks if the array does not contain the given element.

DONE.
