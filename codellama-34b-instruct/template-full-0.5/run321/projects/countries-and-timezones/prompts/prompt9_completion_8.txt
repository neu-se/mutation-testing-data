  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if the `countries` array is falsy, while this replacement code fragment checks if the `countries` array has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.some(country => country === 'USA')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `countries` array is falsy, while this replacement code fragment checks if the `countries` array contains the string 'USA'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.every(country => country !== 'USA')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `countries` array is falsy, while this replacement code fragment checks if every element in the `countries` array is not equal to the string 'USA'.

DONE.
