  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_keys` is a different function that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a different function that returns a boolean indicating whether an object has a specified property as its own property, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a different function that creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `object_toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object.

DONE.
