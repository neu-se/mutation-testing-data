  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `===`, so the expression would be evaluated as `ctx + 1 === 1`, which would always be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has a higher precedence than the `===`, so the expression would be evaluated as `ctx - 1 === 1`, which would always be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has a higher precedence than the `===`, so the expression would be evaluated as `ctx * 2 === 1`, which would always be `false`.

DONE.
