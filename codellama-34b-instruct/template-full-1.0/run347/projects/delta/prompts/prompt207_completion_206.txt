  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete thisOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire `thisOp` object, instead of just the `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
insert Op.length(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the length of the `thisOp` object, instead of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
insert iter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the next operation in the iterator, instead of the current operation.

DONE.
