  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the error if the `Q.onerror` function is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws this error if the `callback` parameter is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws this error if the `callback` parameter is not a function.

DONE.
