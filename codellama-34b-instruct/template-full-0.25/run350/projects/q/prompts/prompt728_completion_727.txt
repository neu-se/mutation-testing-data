  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `all` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `all` function to return a pending promise instead of a fulfilled or rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be canceled instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `all` function to return a canceled promise instead of a fulfilled, rejected, or pending promise.

DONE.
