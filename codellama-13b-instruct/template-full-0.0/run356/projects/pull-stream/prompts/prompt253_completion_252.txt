  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk` function is called immediately, rather than being called asynchronously in the original code. This could cause the `nextChunk` function to be executed before the `read` function is called, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, nextChunk)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk` function is passed as an argument to the `_read` function, rather than being called directly. This could cause the `nextChunk` function to be executed asynchronously, rather than immediately, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function is called immediately, rather than being called asynchronously in the original code. This could cause the `nextStream` function to be executed before the `read` function
