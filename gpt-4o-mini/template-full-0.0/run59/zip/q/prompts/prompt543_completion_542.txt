Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would refer to the context of the function call rather than the array of values, potentially leading to `undefined` or incorrect results when trying to apply the fulfilled callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `fulfilled` function to be called with `null` as the context, which may lead to runtime errors if the `fulfilled` function expects a valid object to operate on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `array[0]` would only apply the `fulfilled` function to the first element of the array instead of spreading all elements, which changes the intended behavior of handling multiple arguments.

DONE.
