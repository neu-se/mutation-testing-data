 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always remove the last unhandledRejection reason instead of the one at the same index as the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always remove the first unhandledRejection reason, regardless of which promise it corresponds to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will randomly remove one unhandledRejection reason, potentially causing loss of information and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
