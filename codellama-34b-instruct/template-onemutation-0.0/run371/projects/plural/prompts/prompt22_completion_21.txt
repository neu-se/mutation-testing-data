  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "crisis" is not included in the original code fragment, but it is included in the new code fragment. This would cause the test to fail because the word "crisis" would not be recognized as a word that ends with "is" and therefore would not be pluralized correctly.

DONE.
