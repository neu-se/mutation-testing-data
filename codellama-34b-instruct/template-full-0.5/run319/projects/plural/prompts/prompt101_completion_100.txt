  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the letter "a" instead of the word "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'f'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the letter "a" with the letter "f" instead of the letter "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'g'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the letter "a" with the letter "g" instead of the letter "e".

DONE.
