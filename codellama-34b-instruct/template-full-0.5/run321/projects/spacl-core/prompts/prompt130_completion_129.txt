  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index > count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition `index > count` is never true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than it should, as the condition `index < count - 1` is true one less time than it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than it should, as the condition `index <= count` is true one more time than it should be.

DONE.
