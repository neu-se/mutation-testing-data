  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `path` string, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `path` string to uppercase, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if the policy names are case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `path` string at the first forward slash and return the first part of the string, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if the policy names contain forward slashes.

DONE.
