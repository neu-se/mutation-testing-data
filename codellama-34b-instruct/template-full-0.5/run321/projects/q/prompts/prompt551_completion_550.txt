  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value of the promise, while this new code returns the value plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value of the promise, while this new code returns the value multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value of the promise, while this new code returns the length of the value.

DONE.
