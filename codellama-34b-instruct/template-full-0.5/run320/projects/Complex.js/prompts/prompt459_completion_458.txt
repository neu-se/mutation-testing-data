  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] > 0 ? Infinity : -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is greater than zero, while this code checks if it is less than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] > 0 ? Infinity : -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the real part of the complex number is greater than zero, while this code checks if it is less than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] + this['im'] > 0 ? Infinity : -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is greater than zero, while this code checks if it is less than zero.

DONE.
