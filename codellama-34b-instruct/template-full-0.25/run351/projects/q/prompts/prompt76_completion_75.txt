  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with value 0, while this code sends a message with value 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage("hello");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with value 0, while this code sends a message with value "hello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with value 0, while this code sends a message with value null.

DONE.
