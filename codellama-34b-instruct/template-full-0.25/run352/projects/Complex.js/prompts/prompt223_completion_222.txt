  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because `r + a` is always positive, while `Math.abs(a)` can be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * r
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * r` can be negative, while `Math.abs(a)` is always positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` can be negative, while `Math.abs(a)` is always positive.

DONE.
