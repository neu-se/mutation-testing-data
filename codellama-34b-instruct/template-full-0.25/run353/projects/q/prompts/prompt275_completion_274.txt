  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the error, whereas the original code would have rejected the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with the error, whereas the original code would have rejected the promise with the error.

DONE.
