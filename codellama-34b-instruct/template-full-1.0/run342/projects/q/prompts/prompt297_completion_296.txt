  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method would return null instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method would return x instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method would return a error object instead of the expected value.

DONE.
