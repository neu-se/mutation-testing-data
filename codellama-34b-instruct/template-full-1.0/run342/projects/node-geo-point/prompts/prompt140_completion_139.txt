  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the changed code would calculate the opposite longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the changed code would calculate a shifted longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the changed code would calculate a random longitude.

DONE.
