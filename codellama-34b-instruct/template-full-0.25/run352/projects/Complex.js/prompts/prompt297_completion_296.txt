  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result would be flipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) + sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be the sum of the sine hyperbolic functions of `a` and `b`, rather than the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be the product of the sine hyperbolic functions of `a` and `b`, rather than the sum.

DONE.
