  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the jQuery 'attr' method on the 'this' keyword, which would return the value of the 'href' attribute of the current element in the iteration. In the original code, '$(this)' was not used, so the 'href' attribute of the current element was not being retrieved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$<PLACEHOLDER>.attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the jQuery 'attr' method on a variable named 'PLACEHOLDER', which would return the value of the 'href' attribute of the element corresponding to the ID or class name in the 'PLACEHOLDER' variable. In the original code, there was no variable named 'PLACEHOLDER', so this change would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).attr('href');
```
