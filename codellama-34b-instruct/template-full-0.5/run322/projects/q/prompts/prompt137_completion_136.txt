  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof QReturnValue !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `"function"` instead of `"undefined"`, as `QReturnValue` is defined as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
QReturnValue !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` keyword is not a function, and `QReturnValue` is defined as a function, so the comparison would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
QReturnValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` keyword is not a function, and `QReturnValue` is defined as a function, so the comparison would return `false` instead of `true`.

DONE.
