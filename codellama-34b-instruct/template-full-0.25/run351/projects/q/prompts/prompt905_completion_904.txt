  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `nodeArgs` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of merging the original array with the provided arguments, while `nodeArgs` is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in an array, while `nodeArgs` is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
