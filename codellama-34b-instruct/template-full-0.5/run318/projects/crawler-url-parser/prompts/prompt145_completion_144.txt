  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.` operator has a different precedence than the `/` operator, and would produce a different result when used in the `replace` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the ` ` (space) character is not the same as the `/` character, and would produce a different result when used in the `replace` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` (backslash) character is not the same as the `/` character, and would produce a different result when used in the `replace` method.

DONE.
