  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "o" regardless of whether they contain the letter "y" or not, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "o" regardless of whether they contain the letter "y" or not, and it would not be case-insensitive, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "o" regardless of whether they contain the letter "y" or not, and it would be case-insensitive, but it would also match words that end with "o" regardless of whether they
