  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 && a['arg'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, while this code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is less than 0 and `a['arg']` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] === 0 && a['arg'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is not finite and `a['arg']` is finite, while this code fragment checks if `a['abs']` is equal to 0 and `a['arg']` is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] > 0 && a['arg'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks
