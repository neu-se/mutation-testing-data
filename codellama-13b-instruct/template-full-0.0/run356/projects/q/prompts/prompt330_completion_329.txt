  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `null` as the argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a new `Error` object as the argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a custom error message.

DONE.
