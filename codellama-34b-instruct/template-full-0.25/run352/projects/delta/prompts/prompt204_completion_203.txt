  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(start)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the remaining elements of the original array, rather than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(start, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements of the original array between the start and end indices, rather than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(start, end).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements of the original array between the start and end indices, in reverse order, rather than the original array.

DONE.
