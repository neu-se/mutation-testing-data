  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects the context object as the first argument, whereas `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the context object and arguments bound to it, whereas `apply` calls the function with the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` with a null context object would call the function with the global object as the context, whereas `apply` with a non-null context object would call the function with the provided context object.

DONE.
