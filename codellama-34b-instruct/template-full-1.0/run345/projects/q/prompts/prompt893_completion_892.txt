  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would never be called, which would cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would never be called, which would cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a null value, which would be unexpected by the user.

DONE.
