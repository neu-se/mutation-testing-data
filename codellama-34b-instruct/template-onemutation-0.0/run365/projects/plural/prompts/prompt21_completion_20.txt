  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match words that end in "us" and then replaces the "us" with "i", while the buggy code fragment uses a regular expression to match words that end in "us" and then replaces the "us" with "i" and then adds an extra "i" to the end of the word.

DONE.
