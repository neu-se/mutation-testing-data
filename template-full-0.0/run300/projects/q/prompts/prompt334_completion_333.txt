  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is a property that always returns the string "unknown", whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object with a `state` property that can have different values depending on the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.value` is a property that always returns `undefined`, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object with a `value` property that can have different values depending on the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.reason` is a property that always returns `undefined`, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object with a `reason` property that can have different values depending on the state of the promise.

DONE.
