  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to convert the `arguments` object to a number, which would result in `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of arguments passed to the function, rather than the arguments themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the `arguments` object, rather than the arguments themselves.

DONE.
