  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` variable is a function that takes two arguments, whereas `rule[0]` is a string or regular expression that is used as a condition for the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a function that takes two arguments, whereas `rule[0]` is a string or regular expression that is used as a condition for the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is a function that takes two arguments, whereas `rule[0]` is a string or regular expression that is used as a condition for the rule.

DONE.
