  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not account for case sensitivity, while the replaced code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not account for the first character of the path, while the replaced code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not account for the path being a URL, while the replaced code fragment does.

DONE.
