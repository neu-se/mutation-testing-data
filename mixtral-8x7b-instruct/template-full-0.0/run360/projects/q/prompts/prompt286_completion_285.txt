 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with the string "function" instead of checking if resolver is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(resolver) !== "[object Function]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's internal [[Class]] property to determine if it's a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== typeof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the type of resolver with the type of the Function constructor, which will not be equal if resolver is not a function.

DONE.
