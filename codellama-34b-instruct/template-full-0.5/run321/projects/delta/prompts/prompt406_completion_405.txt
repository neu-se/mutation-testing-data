  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `Delta` object to access the wrong attribute or property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `Delta` object to access the wrong attribute or property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'embedType' + embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'embedType'` would be concatenated with the value of `embedType`, which could cause the `Delta` object to access the wrong attribute or property.

DONE.
