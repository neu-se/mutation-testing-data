Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the provided value instead of resolving it, leading to a failure state rather than a success state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a value that is incremented by 1, which changes the intended resolved value and could lead to unexpected results in promise consumers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null`, which may not be the intended value and could cause issues in the logic that depends on the resolved value being something meaningful.

DONE.
