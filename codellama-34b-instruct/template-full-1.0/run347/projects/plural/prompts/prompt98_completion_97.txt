  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would be called on the `w` variable, which is a string. This would return an array of substrings split by the specified separator, rather than replacing a portion of the string with a replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toLowerCase
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method would be called on the `w` variable, which is a string. This would return a new string with all characters in lowercase, rather than replacing a portion of the string with a replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method would be called on the `w` variable, which is a string. This would return a boolean indicating whether the specified substring is present in the string, rather than replacing a portion of the string with a replacement string.

DONE.
