  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^\n]/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all characters that are not newline characters with the EOL string, rather than just replacing newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^\n]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all characters that are not newline characters, rather than replacing them with the EOL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all newline characters with the EOL string, rather than just replacing them with the EOL string.

DONE.
