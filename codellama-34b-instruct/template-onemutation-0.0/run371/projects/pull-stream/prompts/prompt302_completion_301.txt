  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if(ended = ended || end) {
    //last ? terminate(cb) :
    cb(ended)
  }
  else if(!test(data)) {
    ended = true
    last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
  }
  else
    cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `read` function with two arguments, while the mutated code fragment calls it with three arguments. This could potentially cause the `read` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.
