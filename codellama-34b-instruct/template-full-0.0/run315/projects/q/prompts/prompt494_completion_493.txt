  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would return the reason for the rejection, while `null` would return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would return the reason for the rejection, while `undefined` would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would return the reason for the rejection, while `"error"` would return the string `"error"`.

DONE.
