  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` method would be called on the `options.url` string instead of the `options.dest` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename()` method would be called on the `options.dest` string instead of the `options.url` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.url))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.join()` method would be called on the `options.dest` string instead of the `options.url` string, and the `path.basename()` method would be called on the `options.url` string instead of the `options.dest` string.

DONE.
