  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr)".
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the base URL from the map, which is necessary for the function to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "urlMap.keys(baseUrlStr)".
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the keys in the map, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "urlMap.size(baseUrlStr)".
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of elements in the map, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
