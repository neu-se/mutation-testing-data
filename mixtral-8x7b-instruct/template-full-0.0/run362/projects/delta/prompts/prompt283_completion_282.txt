 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1, as it's trying to find the index of an empty string in the `thisOp.insert` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1, as `123` is a number and doesn't have an `indexOf` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the string, not the index of a substring.

DONE.
