  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be returned, but `null` is not a function and will cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be returned, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be returned, but `() => {}` is an empty function and will not cause the code to fail.

DONE.
