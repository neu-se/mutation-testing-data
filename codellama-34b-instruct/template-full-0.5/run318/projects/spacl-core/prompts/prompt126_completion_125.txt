  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx && ctx.props
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is undefined, while this replacement checks if `ctx` is truthy and has a `props` property.

DONE.
