 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Buggy replacement")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message, which might cause some tests to fail that are checking for specific error messages.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the value being thrown, which might cause some tests to fail that are checking for specific error types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the thrown value to null, which might cause some tests to fail that are checking for specific error values.

DONE.
