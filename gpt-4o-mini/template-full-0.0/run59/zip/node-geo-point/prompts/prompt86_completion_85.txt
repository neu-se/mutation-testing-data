Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the sine of the angular distance to using the cosine, which will yield incorrect results for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(δ) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the sine of the angular distance, which will distort the calculation of the destination point, leading to an incorrect latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(δ) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the sine of the angular distance by 2, which will incorrectly scale the result and affect the final destination point calculation.

DONE.
