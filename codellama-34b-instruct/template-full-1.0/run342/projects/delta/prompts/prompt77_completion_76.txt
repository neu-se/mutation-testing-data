  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the `insert` property of the `lastOp` object is an object, rather than checking if the `lastOp` object itself is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the `lastOp` object has an `insert` property that is an instance of the `Object` class, rather than checking if the `lastOp` object itself is an instance of the `Object` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the `lastOp` object is not a string, rather than checking if it is an object.

DONE.
