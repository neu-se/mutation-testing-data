  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, even if the input promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is settled with a null value, even if the input promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that is settled with an undefined value, even if the input promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
