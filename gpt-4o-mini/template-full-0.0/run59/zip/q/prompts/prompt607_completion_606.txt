Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalidOperation"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation being dispatched to a string that does not correspond to any valid operation, likely causing the promise to fail or return an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation to the first argument of the `args` array instead of the intended operation, which could lead to incorrect method calls or unexpected behavior depending on the contents of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the operation to `null`, which is not a valid operation name, potentially causing the promise to reject or behave incorrectly when trying to dispatch the operation.

DONE.
