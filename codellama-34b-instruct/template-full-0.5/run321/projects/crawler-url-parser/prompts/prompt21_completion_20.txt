  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to create a URL with the HTTP protocol, while the modified code uses 'https://' to create a URL with the HTTPS protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to create a URL with the HTTP protocol, while the modified code creates a URL without a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to create a URL with the HTTP protocol, while the modified code uses 'ftp://' to create a URL with the FTP protocol.

DONE.
