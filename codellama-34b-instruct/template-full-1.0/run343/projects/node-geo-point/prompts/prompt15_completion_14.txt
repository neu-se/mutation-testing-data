  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is a number and does not have a `length` property, unlike `coordinates`. This change would cause the `if` statement to throw a `ReferenceError` when `point.coordinates.length !== 2` holds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property value is different from 2. This change would cause the `if` statement to throw a `ReferenceError` when `point.coordinates.length !== 2` holds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinates` property is an array of numbers and does not have a `length` property. This change would cause the `if` statement to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
