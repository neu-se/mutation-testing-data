  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` after a delay, while `Q(object).then` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` after a delay, while `Q(object).fapply` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` immediately, but also applies a function to the value of `object` before resolving.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` after a delay, while `Q(object).nf
