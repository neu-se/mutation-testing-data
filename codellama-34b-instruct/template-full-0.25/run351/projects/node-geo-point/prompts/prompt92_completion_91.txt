  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range of values than the `cos` function, and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 - cos` expression would produce a different result for the same input as the `cos` function, and would also have a different range of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(cos)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function would produce a different result for the same input as the `cos` function, and would also have a different range of values.

DONE.
