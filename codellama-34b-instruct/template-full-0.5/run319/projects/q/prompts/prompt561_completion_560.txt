  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function expects a `StopIteration` exception object as its argument, but `exception.value` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function expects a `StopIteration` exception object as its argument, but `exception.message` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function expects a `StopIteration` exception object as its argument, but `exception.name` is a string.

DONE.
