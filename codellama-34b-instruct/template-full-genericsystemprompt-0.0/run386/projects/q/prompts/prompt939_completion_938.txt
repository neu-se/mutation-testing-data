  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` modifies the original array, whereas `concat` returns a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array, whereas `concat` returns a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, whereas `concat` returns a new array.

DONE.
