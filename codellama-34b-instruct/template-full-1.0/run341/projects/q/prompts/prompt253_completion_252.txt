  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when `newPromise` is undefined, it will throw a `TypeError` when `promiseDispatch` is called. Using `null` instead will make the line of code a no-op, and the code will continue running without throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because when `newPromise` is undefined, it will create a new promise that resolves to `undefined`. Using a new promise instead will create a new promise that resolves to `null`, which is different from `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('PLACEHOLDER')
```
This would result in different behavior because when `newPromise` is undefined, it will throw a `TypeError` when `promiseDispatch` is called. Using `new Error('PLACEHOLDER')` instead will throw a different error, which will
