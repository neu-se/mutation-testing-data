  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `thenResolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with the value, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
