  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the attributes to the attributes of the previous operation, while this change would add the attributes to the attributes of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would retain the attributes from the previous operation, while this change would delete the attributes from the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code inverts the attributes, while this change would leave the attributes unchanged.

DONE.
