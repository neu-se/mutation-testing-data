  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the multiplication order changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the multiplication order changed and the signs of the terms reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the multiplication order changed and the signs of the terms reversed.

DONE.
