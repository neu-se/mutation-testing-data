  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `c` is less than `d`, regardless of the magnitude of `c` and `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) <= Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `c` is less than or equal to `d` in magnitude, regardless of the sign of `c` and `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) > Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `c` is greater than `d` in magnitude, regardless of the sign of `c` and `d`.

DONE.
