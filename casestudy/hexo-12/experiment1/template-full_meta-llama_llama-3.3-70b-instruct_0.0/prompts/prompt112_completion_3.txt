Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method converts the slug to uppercase, whereas the original code uses `toString()` and applies a case transformation based on the `config.filename_case` setting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.title
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `title` property of the `data` object instead of the `slug` property, potentially leading to different slug generation results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a random number to the slug, resulting in a unique slug each time the code is executed, whereas the original code generates a deterministic slug based on the `data.slug` value.

DONE.
