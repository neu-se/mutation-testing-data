  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function takes a start index and an end index, and `arguments` is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the function. In the original code, `array_slice(arguments, 1)` returns a new array containing all the arguments except the first one, which is the `object` argument. In this modified code, `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all the arguments except the first two, which would cause the `object` argument to be omitted, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a new array containing all the arguments except the first two, which would cause the `object` and `name` arguments to be omitted, resulting in a different behavior.
