  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This change will cause the `name` argument to be omitted from the `args` array, which may cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This change will cause the `name` argument to be included in the `args` array, but it will also cause the `dispatch` method to receive an additional argument that it may not expect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This change will cause the `name` argument to be included in the `args` array, but it will also cause the `dispatch` method to receive an additional argument that it may not expect.

DONE.
