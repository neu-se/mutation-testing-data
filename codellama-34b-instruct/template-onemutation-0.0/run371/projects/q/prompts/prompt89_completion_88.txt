  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within a function's scope, and it contains the values of the arguments passed to the function. By using `arguments[0]`, we are accessing the first argument passed to the function, which is not the same as the `arguments` object itself.

DONE.
