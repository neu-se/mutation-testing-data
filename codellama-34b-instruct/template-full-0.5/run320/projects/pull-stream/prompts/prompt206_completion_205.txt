  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `aborted`, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` line even if `aborted` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` if `aborted` is true, but to `false` if `aborted` is false, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` line only if `aborted` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `false` if `aborted` is false, but to `true` if `aborted` is true, so the code would execute the `cb(aborted)` line only if `aborted` is false.

DONE.
