  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for a promise, whereas "keys" is a valid method that returns an array of property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to "keys" should be an empty array, as it is used to store the results of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["a", "b", "c"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to "keys" should be an empty array, as it is used to store the results of the function.

DONE.
