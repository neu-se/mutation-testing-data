  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length < 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this new code fragment only checks the length of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this new code fragment only checks for the presence of a specific protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a protocol in the URL, while this new code fragment only checks for the presence of a specific protocol.

DONE.
