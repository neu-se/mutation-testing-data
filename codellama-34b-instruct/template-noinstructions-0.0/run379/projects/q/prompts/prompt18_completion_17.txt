  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `Q` global variable, potentially causing issues with other code that relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q = definition(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `definition` function to the `Q` global variable, potentially causing issues with other code that relies on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q = definition(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `definition` function to the `Q` global variable, potentially causing issues with other code that relies on it.

DONE.
