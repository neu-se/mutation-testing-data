  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This change will cause the `offset` property to be set to 1 instead of 0, which will result in different behavior for the `peekLength()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length - 1;
```
This change will cause the `index` property to be set to the last index of the `ops` array instead of the current index, which will result in different behavior for the `hasNext()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This change will cause the `ops` array to be set to an empty array, which will result in different behavior for the `peek()` method.

DONE.
