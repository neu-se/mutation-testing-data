Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the string "undefined" into the keys array instead of the actual key, leading to incorrect key retrieval from the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the property `key` on the global object (or the current context) instead of the object being iterated over, potentially returning undefined or an unexpected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to a number and increment it by 1, which would not represent the actual key in the object, leading to incorrect key storage in the keys array.

DONE.
