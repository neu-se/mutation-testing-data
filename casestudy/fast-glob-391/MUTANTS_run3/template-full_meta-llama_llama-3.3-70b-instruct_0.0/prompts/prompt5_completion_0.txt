Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(negative, this._micromatchOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is not set to `true` for negative patterns, which could lead to different matching results for patterns that contain dots.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
utils.pattern.convertPatternsToRe(positive, {...this._micromatchOptions, dot: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `positive` array is used instead of the `negative` array, which would cause the filter to match against the wrong set of patterns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => negative.map((pattern) => new RegExp(pattern))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `convertPatternsToRe` function is bypassed and a simple `RegExp` constructor is used instead, which could lead to different regular expression compilation and matching results.

DONE.
