  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substr method would return a different substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a different substring.

DONE.
