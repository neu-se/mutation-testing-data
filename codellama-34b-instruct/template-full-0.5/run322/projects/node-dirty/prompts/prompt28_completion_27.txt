  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream has drained all data from its internal buffer and is ready to accept more data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream has drained all data from its internal buffer and is ready to accept more data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the write stream has reached the end of the file, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream has drained all data from its internal buffer and is ready to accept more data.

DONE.
