  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be thrown, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because a different type of error would be thrown, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be thrown, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
