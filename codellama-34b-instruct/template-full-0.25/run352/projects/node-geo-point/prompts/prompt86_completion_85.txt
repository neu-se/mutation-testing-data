  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the latitude instead of the sine of the angular distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the latitude instead of the sine of the angular distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the bearing instead of the sine of the angular distance.

DONE.
