  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `then` would cause the promise to be resolved twice, potentially leading to unexpected consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` would catch any errors that occur in the promise chain, potentially hiding them from the developer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` values would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` values, which could lead to unexpected consequences if the promise is expected to return specific values.

DONE.
