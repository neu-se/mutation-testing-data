  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `null` instead of the original `object`, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on `undefined` instead of the original `object`, which would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on the number `0` instead of the original `object`, which would likely throw an error.

DONE.
