  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is only called when `z` is an infinite complex number, while the negated expression `!z['isInfinite']` would be called when `z` is not an infinite complex number. This change would potentially result in a different outcome for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression only checked if `z` is infinite, while the updated expression also checks if the base is infinite. This change would potentially result in a different outcome for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite'] && this['re'] !== z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression only checked if `z` is infinite, while the updated expression also checks if the
