  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the string "bug" would cause the resulting JSON string to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringyfy(obj, options) + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the string "bug" would cause the resulting JSON string to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.
