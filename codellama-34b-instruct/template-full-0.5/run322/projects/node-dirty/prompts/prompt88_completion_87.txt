  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `return` to return a value, but the new code fragment is using `return` to exit the function early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid key');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `return` to return a value, but the new code fragment is using `throw` to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return {key: 'invalid'};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `return` to return a value, but the new code fragment is using `return` to return a different value.

DONE.
