  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is converted to lowercase, which could affect the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is converted to uppercase, which could affect the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable is trimmed, which could affect the outcome of the `query` method.

DONE.
