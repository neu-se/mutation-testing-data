 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison with `null` is more strict than the original comparison with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the variable being `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Array.isArray(fileNameAndLineNumber)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is not an array, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
