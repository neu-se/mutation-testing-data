  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` would be incremented by 1, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` would be multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` would be divided by 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
