  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would have one less element than intended, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would have an extra element than intended, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would have one more element than intended, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
