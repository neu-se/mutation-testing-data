  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which is a function. In the original code, `cb` is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, but in the mutated code, `!cb` is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, which has a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the arguments `end` and `data`, but in the original code, `cb` is called with the arguments `end` and `data` only if `end` is not true. In the mutated code, `cb` is called with the arguments `end` and `data` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb`
