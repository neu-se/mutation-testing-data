  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for `currentUrlStr`, whereas `undefined` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'null'` is a string and not a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string and not `null`.

DONE.
