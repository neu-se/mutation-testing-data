  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, the `push` method is used to add a new operation to the end of the `ops` array, so replacing it with `unshift` would cause the new operation to be added to the beginning of the array instead, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the order of the operations in the array.
