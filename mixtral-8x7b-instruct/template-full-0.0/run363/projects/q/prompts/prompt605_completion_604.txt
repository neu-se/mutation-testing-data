 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred.resolve would be replaced with deferred.reject, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved with the result of the dispatched method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred.resolve would be replaced with deferred.promise, causing the promise to always resolve to the same value (the promise itself) instead of the result of the dispatched method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.promise.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because self.promiseDispatch would be replaced with self.promise.dispatch, causing the dispatch method to be called on the promise object instead of the deferred object, which may result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the promise object.

DONE.
