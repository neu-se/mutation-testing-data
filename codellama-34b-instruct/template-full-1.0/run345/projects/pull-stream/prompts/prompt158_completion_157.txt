  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not strictly equal to `null`, but it could be loosely equal depending on how it is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<anything else>
```
This would result in different behavior because `<anything else>` is not a primitive value and would be loosely equal to `null`, but it would not have the same behavior as `null` in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value that is not strictly equal to `null`, but it could be loosely equal depending on how it is used.

DONE.
