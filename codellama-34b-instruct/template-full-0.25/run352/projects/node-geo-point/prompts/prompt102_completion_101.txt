  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180` is a more complex expression that involves multiple operations, while the replacement code fragment `λ2` is a simpler expression that only involves a single operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180` is a more complex expression that involves multiple operations, while the replacement code fragment `λ2 + 540` is a simpler expression that only involves a single operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
