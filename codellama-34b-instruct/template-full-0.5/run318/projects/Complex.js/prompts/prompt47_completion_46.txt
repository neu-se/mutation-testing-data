  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` if `b` does not have the property `arg`, even if `a` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in b && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the first operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` if `b` does not have the property `abs`, even if `a` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is now `||` (OR) instead of `&&` (AND), which would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` if either `a` or `b` has the
