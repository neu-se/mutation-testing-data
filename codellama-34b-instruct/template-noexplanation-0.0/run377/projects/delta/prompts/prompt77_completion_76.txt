  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always insert a new operation at the end of the array, instead of trying to merge it with the previous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === undefined
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always insert a new operation at the end of the array, instead of trying to merge it with the previous operation, if the previous operation does not have a `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain === undefined
```
This change will cause the `push` method to always insert a new operation at the end of the array, instead of trying to merge it with the previous operation, if the previous operation does not have a `retain` property.

DONE.
