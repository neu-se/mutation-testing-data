  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses a different regular expression to replace the last part of the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "") + "/"
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds a trailing slash to the URL path after replacing the last part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "") + "/" + linkurl.path
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds a trailing slash to the URL path after replacing the last part, and then appends the original URL path to the result.

DONE.
