  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the stack counter by one, which would cause the stack trace to become irrelevant for the purpose of debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the stack counter by one, which would cause the stack trace to become less relevant for the purpose of debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the stack counter by two, which would cause the stack trace to become less relevant for the purpose of debugging.

DONE.
