  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `cb` if `end` is falsy, while this code calls `cb` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `data` as the second argument to `cb`, while this code passes `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end) cb(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `end` as the first argument to `cb`, while this code passes `null`.

DONE.
