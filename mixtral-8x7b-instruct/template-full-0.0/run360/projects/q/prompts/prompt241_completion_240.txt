 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.prototype.valueOf` method would always return the `promise` object instead of resolving the promise with a nearer value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.prototype.valueOf` method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `state` property of the `undefined` value, instead of returning the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.prototype.valueOf` method would return the number of messages in the `messages` array instead of resolving the promise with a nearer value.

DONE.
