  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function takes no arguments, and `defer(1)` would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `deffer` is not a defined function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a constructor function and should be called with the `new` keyword, calling it with `call` would not create a new object and would cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
