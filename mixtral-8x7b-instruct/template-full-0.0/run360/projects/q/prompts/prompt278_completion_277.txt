 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would return a callback that does not resolve or reject the deferred promise, causing the promise to never settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would return a callback that only rejects the deferred promise, causing the promise to always be rejected regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.notify;
