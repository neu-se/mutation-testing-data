  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `false` if `self` is not defined, whereas the original code would return `true` if either `window` or `self` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `false` if `window` is not defined, whereas the original code would return `true` if either `window` or `self` is defined.
