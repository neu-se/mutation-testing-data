  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b['im'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if z['im'] is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```z['im'] === 0 && b['im'] === 0```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if this['im'] is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```z['im'] !== 0 && this['im'] === 0```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if z['im'] is not equal to 0.

DONE.
