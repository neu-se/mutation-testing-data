  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method checks if the value is positive or negative infinity, while the `isZero()` method checks if the value is exactly zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property contains the real part of the complex number and the `im` property contains the imaginary part, so the result of the subtraction will be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs()` method returns the absolute value of the complex number, while the `re` and `im` properties contain the real and imaginary parts, respectively.

DONE.
