 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { read(abort, cb) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call the `read` function and pass `abort` and `cb` to it, instead of checking for the existence of `_read` first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read.apply(this, [abort, cb])
