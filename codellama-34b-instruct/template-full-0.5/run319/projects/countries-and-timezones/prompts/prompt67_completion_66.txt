  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `countries[id]` property to `null`, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { ...options };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same properties as the `options` object, and assign it to the `countries[id]` property, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

DONE.
