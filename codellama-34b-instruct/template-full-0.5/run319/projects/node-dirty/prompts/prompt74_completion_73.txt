  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1` instead of `0`, which could cause the code that listens to the `load` event to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `-1` instead of `0`, which could cause the code that listens to the `load` event to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `'foo'` instead of `0`, which could cause the code that listens to the `load` event to behave differently.

DONE.
