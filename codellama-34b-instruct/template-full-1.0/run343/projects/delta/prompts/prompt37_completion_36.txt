```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values, rather than the keys or entries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, rather than the keys or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and would therefore throw an error when trying to access properties.

DONE.
