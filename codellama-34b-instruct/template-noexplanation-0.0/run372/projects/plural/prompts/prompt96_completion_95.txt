  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the 'a' and 'e' characters swapped. This will cause the function to replace 'e' with 'a' instead of the other way around, which may produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e').replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This code fragment first replaces 'a' with 'e', and then replaces 'e' with 'a'. This will effectively swap the 'a' and 'e' characters in the input string, which may also produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/[ae]/g, function(match) { return match === 'a' ? 'e' : 'a' }) }
```
This code fragment uses a regular expression to
