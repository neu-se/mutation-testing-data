  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value for the number of items in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size - 1
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value for the number of items in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size * 2
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value for the number of items in the database.

DONE.
