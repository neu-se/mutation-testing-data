  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest` property of the `thisIter` object is not defined, and therefore the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method of the `thisIter` object is called without any arguments, and therefore the code would return the next operation in the `thisIter` object, rather than the rest of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property of the `thisIter` object is an array of operations, and therefore the code would return the entire array of operations, rather than the rest of the operations.

DONE.
