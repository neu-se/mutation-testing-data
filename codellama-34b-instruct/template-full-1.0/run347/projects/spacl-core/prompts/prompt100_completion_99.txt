  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the path, which could cause the query to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the path, which could cause the query to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the path, which could cause the query to return incorrect results.

DONE.
