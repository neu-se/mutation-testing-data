Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the name of the link instead of its parent path, potentially causing issues in the `Dirent` object's `path` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getNode().getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the path of the node associated with the link, which may not be the same as the parent path of the link, potentially causing inconsistencies in the `Dirent` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/' + link.getName()
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends a slash to the name of the link, which is not the correct way to construct the parent path, potentially causing issues in the `Dirent` object's `path` property.

DONE.
