  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `nbind` function is now `thisp`, which is not the same as `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not the same as `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` is not the same as `arguments`.

DONE.
