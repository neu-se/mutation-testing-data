  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length()` function would return 0, which would cause the `transformPosition()` function to return 0, which would cause the `transform()` function to return a delta with a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length()` function would return 1, which would cause the `transformPosition()` function to return 1, which would cause the `transform()` function to return a delta with a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length()` function would return 2, which would cause the `transformPosition()` function to return 2, which would cause the `transform()` function to return a delta with a length of 2.

DONE.
