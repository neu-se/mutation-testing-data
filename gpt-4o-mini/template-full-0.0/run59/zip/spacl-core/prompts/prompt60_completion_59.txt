Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^(.*)$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match any string instead of the intended path format, allowing invalid paths to be considered valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise() + '.*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a wildcard to the end of the regex, which could match additional characters after a valid path, potentially allowing incorrect matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('') + '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the parts without the necessary anchors, leading to a regex that may not correctly enforce the start and end of the path, allowing for unintended matches.

DONE.
