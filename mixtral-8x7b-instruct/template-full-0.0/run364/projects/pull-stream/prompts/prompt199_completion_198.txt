 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with an error, even if the source hasn't ended yet. This is different from the original behavior, which only calls the callback with an error if the source has ended with an error or if it has been aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'aborted'
