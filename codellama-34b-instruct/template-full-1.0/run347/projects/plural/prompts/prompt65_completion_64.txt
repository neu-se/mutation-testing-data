  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bactaria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected output for the word "bacterium" is "bacteria," but the mutation would result in "bactaria."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteria' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected output for the word "bacterium" is "bacteria," but the mutation would result in "bacteria1."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', function() { return 'bacteria'; } + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected output for the word "bacterium" is "bacteria," but the mutation would result in a function that returns "bacteria1."

DONE.
