  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes an error object as its argument, while `read` is a function that takes a null or undefined value as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, err)` would pass the error object as the second argument to the callback function, while `read(err, cb)` would pass the error object as the first argument to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb(err, null)` would pass the error object as the first argument to the callback function, while `read(err, cb)` would pass the error object as the second argument to the callback function.

DONE.
