  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `terminate` function, which sets the `last` variable to `false` and calls the `cb` function with an error or `true`. In contrast, the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the `cb` function with `null` and `data`, which may not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` calls the `terminate` function, which sets the `last` variable to `false` and calls the `cb` function with an error or `true`. In contrast, the new code fragment `cb(true, data)` calls the `cb` function with `true` and `data`, which may not have the same effect as the original code.
