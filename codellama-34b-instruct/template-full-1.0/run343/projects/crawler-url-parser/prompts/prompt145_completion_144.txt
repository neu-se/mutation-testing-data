  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to only replace the first occurrence of the pattern, instead of all occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/default$\.htm/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to only replace the pattern if it is followed by the string "default." and a period character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/default\.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to only replace the pattern if it is preceded by the string "default." and a period character.

DONE.
