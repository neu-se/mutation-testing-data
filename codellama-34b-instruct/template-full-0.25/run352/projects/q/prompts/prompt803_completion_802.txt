  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function (error) { throw error; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
