 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect` method without passing the `<PLACEHOLDER>` as an argument. This change would cause the `nearer` function to always return the inspected object, even if it's a promise, and not the actual value or the resolved/rejected reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply returns the input value without checking if it's a promise or not. This change would cause the `nearer` function to always return the input value, ignoring the actual state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of checking the state of the promise. This change would cause the `nearer` function to return a random number, making it impossible to predict
