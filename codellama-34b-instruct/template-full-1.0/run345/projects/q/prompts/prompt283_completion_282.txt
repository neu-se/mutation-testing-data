  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number of arguments to fulfill() instead of passing an array of arguments starting from the second one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments object of the function that called makeNodeResolver() instead of passing the arguments of the callback function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a subset of the arguments starting from the second one, instead of passing all arguments.

DONE.
