  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on all objects, and it is used to determine if a value is a promise or not. Using `value.then` would cause the code to throw an error if `value` does not have a `then` method, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a particular class, and it is used to determine if a value is a promise or not. Using `value instanceof Promise` would cause the code to return `false` if `value` is not an instance of the `Promise` class, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object is used to determine if it
