  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an empty array, instead of an array with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an array with the first two elements removed, instead of just the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an array with the last element removed, instead of just the first element.

DONE.
