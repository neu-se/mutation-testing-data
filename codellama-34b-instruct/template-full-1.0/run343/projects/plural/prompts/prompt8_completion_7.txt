  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match[1], result]
```
This would result in different behavior because `match[1]` is the contents of the first capture group in the regular expression, which may not be the same as the entire matched string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result.toLowerCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the entire matched string to lowercase, whereas `result` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match.toUpperCase(), result]
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would convert the entire matched string to uppercase, whereas `result` would not.

DONE.
