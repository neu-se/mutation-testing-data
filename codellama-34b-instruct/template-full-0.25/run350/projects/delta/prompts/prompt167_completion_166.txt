  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `thisIter` iterator onto the `delta` array, which is not the same as the original code that pushed the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator onto the `delta` array, which is not the same as the original code that pushed the next operation from the `thisIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value onto the `delta` array, which is not the same as the original code that pushed an operation from one of the iterators.

DONE.
