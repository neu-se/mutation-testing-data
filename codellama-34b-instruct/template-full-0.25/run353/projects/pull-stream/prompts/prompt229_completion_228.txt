  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is not being called on the `tester` object, which is likely to cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is being called on the `tester` object, but with the wrong argument. The `test` method expects a string, but `data` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is being called on the `tester` object with the correct argument, but the `value` property of the `data` object is not being accessed correctly.

DONE.
