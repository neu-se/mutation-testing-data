 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the base would always be a positive constant value, instead of the original first component of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation would be incorrect, as it would be the square of the first component of the complex number instead of the original base raised to the exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation would be incorrect, as it would use the square root of the first component of the complex number instead of the original base raised to the exponent.

DONE.
