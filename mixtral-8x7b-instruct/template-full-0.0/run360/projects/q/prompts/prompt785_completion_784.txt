 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected reason would be thrown as an exception instead of being passed to the next `catch` or `done` handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise instead of propagating the original rejection. This could lead to uncaught rejections or different error handling behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q.reject(rejected); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise wrapped in a fulfillment handler, which would change the timing and structure of the returned promise.

DONE.
