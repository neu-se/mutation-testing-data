  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `path` and `ctx` strings, whereas the original code fragment would pass the `path` and `ctx` variables as separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'hello world'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenated string would include the text 'hello world', whereas the original code fragment would not include any additional text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return the `path` string starting from the third character (index 2), whereas the original code fragment would pass the full `path` string as a separate argument.

DONE.
