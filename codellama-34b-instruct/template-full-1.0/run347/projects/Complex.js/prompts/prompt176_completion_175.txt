  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a < 0) { return -1 } else { return 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional statement would always return -1 when `a` is negative, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * a` would square the value of `a`, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value.

DONE.
