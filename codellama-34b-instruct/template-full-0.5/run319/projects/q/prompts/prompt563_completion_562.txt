  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is the exception object itself, whereas `exception.value` is the value of the exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is the message property of the exception object, whereas `exception.value` is the value of the exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is the stack trace property of the exception object, whereas `exception.value` is the value of the exception object.

DONE.
