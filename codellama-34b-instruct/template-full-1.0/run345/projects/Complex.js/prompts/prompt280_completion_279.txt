  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `b`. This would result in different behavior because `b` is the second argument of the `atan2` function, which means that the tangent of the angle between the vectors (0, 0) and (0, 1) would be calculated, resulting in 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Math.atan2(a, b)`. This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of the angle between the vectors (0, 0) and (0, 1), resulting in Ï€/2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `atan2(b, a)`. This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of the angle between the vectors (0, 0) and (1, 0), resulting in 0.

DONE.
