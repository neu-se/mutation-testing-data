  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, even if the input is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `true`, even if the input is not a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, even if the input is a finite number.

DONE.
