  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the `ends` promise with an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, while this modified code resolves it with a promise that resolves to an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({head: value, tail: Q.reject(error)});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the `ends` promise with an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, while this modified code resolves it with an object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, but the `tail` property is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({head: value, tail: Q.defer()});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the `ends` promise with
