  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is expected to be a number, but here it is being replaced with 0, which would cause the logic to not execute the correct code path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value 1 is not the same as the value of `elem.delete`, so the logic would not execute the correct code path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `elem.delete`, so the logic would not execute the correct code path.

DONE.
