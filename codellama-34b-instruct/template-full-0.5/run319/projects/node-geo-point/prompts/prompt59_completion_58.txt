  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point, while `φ2` is the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI / 2` is a constant representing the value of π/2, while `φ2` is a variable representing the latitude of the destination point.

DONE.
