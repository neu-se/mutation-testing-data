  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, true)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an additional argument `true` to the `parse` function, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, false)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an additional argument `false` to the `parse` function, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, null)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an additional argument `null` to the `parse` function, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
