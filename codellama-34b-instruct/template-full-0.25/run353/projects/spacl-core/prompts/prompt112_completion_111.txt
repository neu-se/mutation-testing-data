  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This would cause the `allow()` method to only allow the verbs that are explicitly listed in the `verbs` object, rather than all verbs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, rather than the keys. This would cause the `allow()` method to only allow the verbs that are explicitly listed in the `verbs` object, rather than all verbs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, rather than the values
