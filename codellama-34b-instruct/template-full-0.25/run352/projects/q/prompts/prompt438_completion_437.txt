  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `promise` is included in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if it is present at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `promise` is included in the `unhandledRejections` array by checking if its index is not equal to -1.

DONE.
