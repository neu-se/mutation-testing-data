  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the original code fragment resolved the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, which would not be related to the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that would be resolved when the original promise is resolved, but it would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
