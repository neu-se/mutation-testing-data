  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the order of the callbacks in the queue would be reversed, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the last callback in the queue would be removed, potentially causing the `Dirty` class to miss important updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the first callback in the queue would be removed,
