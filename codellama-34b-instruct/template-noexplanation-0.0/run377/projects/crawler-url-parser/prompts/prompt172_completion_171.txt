  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.parent
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `true` because `module.parent` is a property that is always defined in a Node.js module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!module.parent
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `false` because `module.parent` is a property that is always defined in a Node.js module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `true` because `module.exports` is a property that is always defined in a Node.js module.

DONE.
