  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `changeLength` method to return a different value than the original code, which could lead to errors in the program's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `changeLength` method to return a different value than the original code, which could lead to errors in the program's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `changeLength` method to return a different value than the original code, which could lead to errors in the program's logic.

DONE.
