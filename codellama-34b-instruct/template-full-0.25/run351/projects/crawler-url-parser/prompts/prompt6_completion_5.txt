  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the URL, potentially changing its meaning and causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the URL to uppercase, potentially changing its meaning and causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the URL, potentially changing its meaning and causing the test to fail.

DONE.
