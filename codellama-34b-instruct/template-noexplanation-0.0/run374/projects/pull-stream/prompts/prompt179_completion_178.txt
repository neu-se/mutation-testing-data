  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not a valid abort signal. This will cause the function to return `cb(true)` immediately, even if the `abort` signal is not actually present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is not a valid abort signal. This will cause the function to return `cb(true)` immediately, even if the `abort` signal is not actually present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which is not a valid abort signal. This will cause the function to return `cb(true)` immediately, even if the `abort` signal is not actually present.
