  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, even if `define` is a function and `define['amd']` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& true` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, even if `define` is not a function or `define['amd']` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && !define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `!define['amd']` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, even if `define` is a function and `define['amd']` is truthy.

DONE.
