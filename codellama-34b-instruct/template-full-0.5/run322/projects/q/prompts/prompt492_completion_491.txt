  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise and does not have a `then` method, so the `then` method would not be called and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise and does not have a `then` method, so the `then` method would not be called and the promise would not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, so the `then` method would be called with `undefined` as the fulfillment value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
