 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the output would be sent to the error console instead of the warning console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the output would be sent to the log console instead of the warning console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because the output would clear the console instead of displaying a message.

DONE.
