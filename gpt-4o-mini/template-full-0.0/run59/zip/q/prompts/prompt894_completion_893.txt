Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from(arguments)` creates a new array from the `arguments` object, which may not preserve the original array-like structure and could lead to unexpected results when the function is called with different argument types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `[].slice.call(arguments)` creates a shallow copy of the `arguments` object, but it does not handle the case where `arguments` is empty, potentially leading to an empty array being passed where a non-empty array is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(arguments)` attempts to extract the values of the `arguments` object as if it were a regular object, which may not yield the expected results since `arguments` is an array-like object and not a standard object.

DONE.
