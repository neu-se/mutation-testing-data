  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, whereas `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, whereas `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, whereas `cb()` is a function call with no arguments.

DONE.
