 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the Q.defer() method instead of the defer() method local to the module, potentially causing issues with the internal tracking and resolution of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a resolved promise using Promise.resolve() instead of using the defer() method to create a deferred object, which may not allow for proper rejection handling or the execution of continuation functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `defer` method on the current promise object, which is not guaranteed to have a `defer` method. This would likely cause an error and prevent the proper functioning of the code.

DONE.
