Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more character than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect deletion of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one less character than the actual length, which could lead to incomplete deletions and incorrect state of the `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively delete zero characters regardless of the intended length, resulting in no change to the `Delta` when a deletion was expected.

DONE.
