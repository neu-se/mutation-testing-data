 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math` object is being used as a namespace, which is not necessary and not how it is used in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / cos(point2Rad)
