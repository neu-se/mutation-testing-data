  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude would be shifted by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude would be shifted by -180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude would be doubled, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
