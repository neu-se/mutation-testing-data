  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` would negate the error, causing the code to execute differently than the original code fragment `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is never equal to `false`, making the code go down a different execution path than the original code fragment `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an error, causing the code to execute differently than the original code fragment `err`.

DONE.
