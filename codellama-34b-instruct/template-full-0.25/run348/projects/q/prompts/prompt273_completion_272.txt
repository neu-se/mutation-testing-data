  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `progress` property, and it would cause the `become` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `progress` property, and it would cause the `become` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a valid value for the `progress` property, and it would cause the `become` function to throw an error.

DONE.
