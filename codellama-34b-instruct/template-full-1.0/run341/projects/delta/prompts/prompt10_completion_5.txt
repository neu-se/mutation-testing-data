  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `b` condition if `a` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would execute both conditions independently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `b` condition if `a` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would execute both conditions independently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `b` condition if `a` is not equal to `b`, whereas the original code fragment would execute both conditions independently.

DONE.
