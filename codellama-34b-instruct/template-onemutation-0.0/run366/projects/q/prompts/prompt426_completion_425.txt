  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the promise's state, which would cause the `isFulfilled` function to always return `true`, even for rejected promises.

DONE.
