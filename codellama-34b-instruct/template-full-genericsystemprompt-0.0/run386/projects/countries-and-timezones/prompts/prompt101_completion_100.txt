  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original code, i.e., it would return the deprecated timezones instead of the non-deprecated ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated && tzs[key].name !== 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the UTC timezone from the list of non-deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated || tzs[key].name === 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the UTC timezone in the list of deprecated timezones.

DONE.
