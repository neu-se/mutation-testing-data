  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `op.attributes` property, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op.attributes` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality, and the `op.attributes` property would be null if it is not defined, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op.attributes` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would check for strict inequality, and the `op.attributes` property would be null if it is not defined, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even
