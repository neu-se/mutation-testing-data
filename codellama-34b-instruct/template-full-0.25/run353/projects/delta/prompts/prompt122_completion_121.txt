  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.insert` is a different value than `elem`, and the code is checking if `elem` is equal to `elem.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.delete` is a different value than `elem`, and the code is checking if `elem` is equal to `elem.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different value than `elem`, and the code is checking if `elem` is equal to `elem.retain`.

DONE.
