  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the next operation is an insertion, which could change the outcome of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
iter.peekType() !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the next operation is a retention, which could change the outcome of the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
iter.peekType() !== 'other'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the next operation is of a different type, which could change the outcome of the comparison.

DONE.
