  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the imaginary part of the complex number is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the imaginary part of the complex number is less than zero.

DONE.
