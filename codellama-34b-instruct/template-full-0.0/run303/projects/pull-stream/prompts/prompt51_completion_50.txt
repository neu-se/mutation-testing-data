  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the truthiness of the `s` variable. If `s` is truthy, `!s` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used to concatenate strings, and `s` is a string. If `s` is "hello", then `s + 1` would be "hello1".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method returns the string with all characters in uppercase. If `s` is "hello", then `s.toUpperCase()` would be "HELLO".

DONE.
