 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the reducer function is changed, which can lead to unexpected results if the reducer function is not commutative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the same accumulator value is passed twice to the reducer function, which can lead to unexpected results if the reducer function is not idempotent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, sink)
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function is now being passed the sink object as the second argument instead of the data value, which can lead to unexpected results if the reducer function is not designed to handle such input.

DONE.
