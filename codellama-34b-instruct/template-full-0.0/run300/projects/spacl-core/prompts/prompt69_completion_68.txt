  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `rule` object with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `rule` object with only the `path` and `verb` arguments, which would cause the `ctx` argument to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method on the `rule` object with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments, but the `ctx` argument would be a clone of the original `ctx` object, which could cause the behavior of the `query` method to be
