  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `any` variable would be evaluated first, and the result would be different if `any` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `any` variable, so the result would be different if `any` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `any` variable, and the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the result would be different if `any` is `true`.

DONE.
