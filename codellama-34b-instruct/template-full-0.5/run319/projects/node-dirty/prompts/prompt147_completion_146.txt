  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is an empty array, but this replacement would cause `cbs` to be `null`, which would result in an error when trying to iterate over it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is an empty array, but this replacement would cause `cbs` to be a function, which would result in an error when trying to iterate over it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is an empty array, but this replacement would cause `cbs` to be `undefined`, which would result in an error when trying to iterate over it.

DONE.
