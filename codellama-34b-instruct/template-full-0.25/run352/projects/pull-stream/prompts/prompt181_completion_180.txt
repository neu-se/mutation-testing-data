  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is called immediately, whereas in the original code it is only called if the `abort` parameter is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is called with a different `this` context, whereas in the original code it is called with the same `this` context as the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is called with a different set of arguments, whereas in the original code it is called with the same arguments as the surrounding code.

DONE.
