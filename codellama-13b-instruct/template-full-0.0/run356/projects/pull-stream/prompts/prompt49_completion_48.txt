  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 0 instead of 1, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would include the last element in the array, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the array, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
