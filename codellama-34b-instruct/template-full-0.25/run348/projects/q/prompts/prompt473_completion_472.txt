  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` is an array, and `atReport.length` would return the length of the array, which is not the same as `atReport` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` is an array, and `atReport[0]` would return the first element of the array, which is not the same as `atReport` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` is an array, and `atReport.pop()` would remove and return the last element of the array, which is not the same as `atReport` itself.

DONE.
