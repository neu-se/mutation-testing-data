 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[...delta.ops, ...other.ops.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the second and subsequent operations from `other` Delta, instead of just the first operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.ops.slice().concat(other.ops.slice(1))
