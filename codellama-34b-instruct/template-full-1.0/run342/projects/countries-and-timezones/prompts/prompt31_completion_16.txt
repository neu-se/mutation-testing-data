  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-hours
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would result in a negative value for `hours`, which would change the output of `getNumStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the output of `getNumStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition by 1 would change the output of `getNumStr`.

DONE.
