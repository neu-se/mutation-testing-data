  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` throws a new error instead of re-throwing the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q.reject(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a new promise that is rejected instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is used in a different context and could potentially be caught by a try-catch block.

DONE.
