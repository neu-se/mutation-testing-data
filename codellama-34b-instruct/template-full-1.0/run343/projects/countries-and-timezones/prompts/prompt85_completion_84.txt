  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object instead of the actual options object, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null instead of the actual country object, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return undefined instead of the actual country object, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the code.

DONE.
