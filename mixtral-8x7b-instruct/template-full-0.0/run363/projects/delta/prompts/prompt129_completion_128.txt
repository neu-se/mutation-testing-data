 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next || function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a falsy value (a no-op function) that would bypass the conditional check and cause the `slice` method to return an incorrect `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` since `iter.skip` is not a function defined in the provided code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the next operation without consuming it, causing the loop to iterate incorrectly and resulting in an incorrect `Delta` object.

DONE.
