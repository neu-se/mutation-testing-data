  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update()` method would receive a null value as the first argument, which would cause it to throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update()` method would receive an undefined value as the first argument, which would cause it to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `update()` method would receive an empty object as the first argument, which would cause it to throw a TypeError.

DONE.
