  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
functionName().includes("module");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a Regex to match the string, which may not always be found in the output of `functionName()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
functionName().length > 3;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a Regex to match the string, which may not always be found in the output of `functionName()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const regex = /module/;
regex.test(functionName());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a Regex with the `test()` method to match the string, which may not always be found in the output of `functionName()`.
