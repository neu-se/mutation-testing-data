  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `undefined` is not. If the function is called with `undefined` as the argument, it will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `0` is not. If the function is called with `0` as the argument, it will return `true` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `''` is not. If the function is called with `''` as the argument, it will return `true` instead of `null`.

DONE.
