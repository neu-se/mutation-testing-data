  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call(null)` would cause the `resolver` function to be called with `this` set to `null`, which could potentially break the code if the function relies on `this` being set to a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply(null)` would cause the `resolver` function to be called with `this` set to `null`, which could potentially break the code if the function relies on `this` being set to a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` would cause the `resolver` function to be called with `this` set to `null`, which could potentially break the code if the function relies on `this` being set to a specific value
