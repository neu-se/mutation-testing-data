  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected when the Node.js-style callback is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid argument"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will be rejected with an error message, even if the Node.js-style callback is called with a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will be resolved with a null value, even if the Node.js-style callback is called with a valid argument.

DONE.
