Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `attributes` property to `null`, which would change the expected output of the `next` method when `attributes` are expected to be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retOp.attributes = nextOp.attributes ? nextOp.attributes : {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns an empty object to `retOp.attributes` if `nextOp.attributes` is falsy, potentially altering the expected structure of the returned operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retOp.attributes = nextOp.attributes.length > 0 ? nextOp.attributes : undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `undefined` to `retOp.attributes` if `nextOp.attributes` is an empty array, which could lead to unexpected results when the attributes are expected to be present.

DONE.
