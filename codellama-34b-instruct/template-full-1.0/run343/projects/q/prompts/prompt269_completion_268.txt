  Option 1: The `reject` function can be replaced with `resolve`.

This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function signals that an error has occurred and the promise should be rejected, while `resolve` signals that the operation was successful, and the promise should be fulfilled. Using `resolve` in place of `reject` could cause the program to behave incorrectly, potentially hiding errors or leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The `reject` function can be replaced with `fulfill`.

This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that is called when a promise is fulfilled, while `reject` is a function that is called when a promise is rejected. Using `fulfill` in place of `reject` could cause the program to behave incorrectly, potentially hiding errors or leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The `reject` function can be replaced with `Q.reject`.

This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that is used to create a promise that is rejected, while `reject` is a function that is used to reject a
