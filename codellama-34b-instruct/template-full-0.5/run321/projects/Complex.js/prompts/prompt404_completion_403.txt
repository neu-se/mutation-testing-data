  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the imaginary part of the complex number, while replacing it with 0 would cause the check to always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the imaginary part of the complex number, while replacing it with 1 would cause the check to always return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the imaginary part of the complex number, while replacing it with -1 would cause the check to always return false.

DONE.
