  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end` before assigning it to `ended`, which would cause the `ended` variable to have the opposite value of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || last
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to `true` if either `end` or `last` is `true`, even if the previous value of `ended` was `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && last
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to `true` if both `end` and `last` are `true`, even if the previous value of `ended` was `false`.

DONE.
