  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is called with a `null` argument, while the mutated code fragment `read(true)` is called with a `true` argument. This change would cause the `read` function to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different output or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is called with a `null` argument, while the mutated code fragment `read(false)` is called with a `false` argument. This change would cause the `read` function to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different output or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (err) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is called with a `null` argument and a callback function, while the mutated code fragment `
