  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will only execute the function if `done` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would execute the function regardless of the value of `done`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { throw new Error('done is not a function') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment will throw an error if `done` is not a function, whereas the original code fragment would simply ignore the error and continue executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || function () { console.log('done is not a function') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment will log a message to the console if `done` is not a function, whereas the original code fragment would simply ignore the error and continue executing.

DONE.
