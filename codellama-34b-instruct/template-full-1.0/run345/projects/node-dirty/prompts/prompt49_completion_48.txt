  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `updater` function on the return value of `this.get(key)`, which may not be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(key, this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the `key` and the value at that key, rather than just the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the `get` method of the class and the `key`, rather than the value at that key.

DONE.
