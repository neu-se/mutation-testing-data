  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now case-sensitive, so it will only match the byte order mark (BOM) if it is in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/i, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now case-insensitive, so it will match the BOM regardless of whether it is in uppercase or lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now global, so it will replace all occurrences of the BOM in the string, rather than just the first one.

DONE.
