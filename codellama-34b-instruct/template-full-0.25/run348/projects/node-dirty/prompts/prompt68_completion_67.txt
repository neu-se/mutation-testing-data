  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.path` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if the file does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.path.length` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if the file is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.indexOf('file')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.path.indexOf('file')` would return -1 if the file does not exist, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
