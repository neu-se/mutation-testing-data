  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is being emitted as an error event instead of the original error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 'invalid error'
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is being emitted as an error event instead of the original error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('invalid error')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object is being created and emitted as the error event instead of the original error object.

DONE.
