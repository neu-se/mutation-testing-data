  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that searches for a match in a string, whereas `match` is a method that matches a string against a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings, whereas `match` is a method that matches a string against a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a substring in a string, whereas `match` is a method that matches a string against a regular expression.

DONE.
