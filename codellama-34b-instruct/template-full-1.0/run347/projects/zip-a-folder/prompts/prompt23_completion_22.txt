  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
overwrite: false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `overwrite` option is set to `false` in the original code, which means that the `archive` will not overwrite any existing files with the same name. However, if we set `overwrite` to `true`, the `archive` will overwrite any existing files with the same name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
store: true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` option is set to `false` in the original code, which means that the `archive` will not store any files. However, if we set `store` to `true`, the `archive` will store any files that are added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `tar` in the original code, which means that the `archive` will create a tar archive.
