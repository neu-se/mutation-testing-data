  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `end` parameter is `true`, while the new code always returns `null`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `end` parameter is `true`, while the new code always returns `undefined`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `end` parameter is `true`, while the new code always returns an error message, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
