  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "function" for both `exports` and `module`, even if they are not functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "object" for `exports` and "undefined" for `module`, even if they are not objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return "undefined" for `exports` and "object" for `module`, even if they are not undefined.

DONE.
