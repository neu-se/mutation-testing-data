  Sure, I'll do that.  Here are three changes that satisfy the requirements:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```type.split('e')```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is the return value of another function, and the modified code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```type.toUpperCase()```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, and the modified code fragment is now all uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Object.keys(rule[0]).indexOf(word) >= 0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression match, and the modified code fragment is a string index of match.

DONE.
