  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method with a string replacement only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement, while this code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement only.

DONE.
