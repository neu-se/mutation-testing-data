 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getCountriesForTimezone.bind(null, tzName, options)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly returns the first element of the returned array without checking if the array is not empty or if the first element is the desired country.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[countryId]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the country object directly, without checking if the timezones property exists and contains the desired timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries[countryId]
