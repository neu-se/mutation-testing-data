 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` always returns a resolved promise, while the original `when` function handles both resolved and rejected states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty function instead of handling the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is an asynchronous function, and the result would not be handled properly in the current context.

DONE.
