  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, potentially altering the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations and uses the sine function instead of cosine, potentially altering the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - (sin(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different formula altogether, potentially returning a different distance value.

DONE.
