  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').val
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is a method that returns the value of a form field, whereas `attr` is a method that returns the value of an attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 $['base'].href
```
This would result in different behavior because `href` is a property that returns the URL of an anchor element, whereas `attr` is a method that returns the value of an attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 $('base').prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a method that returns the specified property value, whereas `attr` is a method that returns the value of an attribute.

DONE.
