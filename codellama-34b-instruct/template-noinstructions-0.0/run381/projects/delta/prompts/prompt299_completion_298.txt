  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length` is a number, while `line` is a string, and the `eachLine` method expects a string as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.substring(0, 1)` is a string, while `line` is a string, and the `eachLine` method expects a string as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.split('')` is an array of strings, while `line` is a string, and the `eachLine` method expects a string as its first argument.

DONE.
