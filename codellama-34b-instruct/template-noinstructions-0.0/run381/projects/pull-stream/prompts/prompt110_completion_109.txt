  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to initialize the `acc` variable, while `null` would initialize it to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to initialize the `acc` variable, while `undefined` would initialize it to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to initialize the `acc` variable, while `0` would initialize it to `0`.

DONE.
