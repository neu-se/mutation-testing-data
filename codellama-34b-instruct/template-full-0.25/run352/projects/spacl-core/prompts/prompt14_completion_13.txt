  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this replacement checks if the path does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\/.+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash and contains at least one character, while this replacement checks if the path starts with a slash and contains at least two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains at least one character, while this replacement checks if the path contains at least two characters.

DONE.
