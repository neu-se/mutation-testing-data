  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `delta.chop` would return a new `Delta` object with the same ops as `delta`, while the modified code fragment `delta.retain(1)` would return a new `Delta` object with the same ops as `delta` but with an additional `retain` op at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `delta.chop` would return a new `Delta` object with the same ops as `delta`, while the modified code fragment `delta.delete(1)` would return a new `Delta` object with the same ops as `delta` but with a `delete` op at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(1, { bold: true })
```
This would result in different behavior
