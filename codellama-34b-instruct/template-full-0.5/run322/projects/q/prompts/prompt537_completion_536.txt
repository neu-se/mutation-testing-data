  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null` instead of `value`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of `value`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the specified error message, which could cause the rest of the code to handle the error differently.

DONE.
