 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forcefully passes a large number as the argument to the `next` method, potentially consuming more operations than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing the loop to iterate indefinitely or process the same operation multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to get the previous operation, which is not defined in the current context, causing an error and affecting the loop execution.

DONE.
