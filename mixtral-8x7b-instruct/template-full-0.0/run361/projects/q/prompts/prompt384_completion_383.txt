 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is removed, and the callback is directly called with the `value`. This could cause issues if the `callback` is asynchronous and expects a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(callback(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new promise is created, resolving the callback's result, instead of directly passing the `value` to the `thenResolve` method. This could cause issues if the `callback` returns a promise that needs to be awaited.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.fcall(Promise.resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is used instead of directly calling the `callback`, and the `value` is resolved before being passed to the `fcall` method. This could cause issues if the `callback`
