Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed even when `args` is not null, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error only if `args` has one or more elements, which could allow the function to execute without throwing an error when `args` is empty, thus changing the intended control flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof args === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `args` is undefined instead of null, which would not throw an error if `args` is defined but empty, allowing the function to execute without the intended restriction.

DONE.
