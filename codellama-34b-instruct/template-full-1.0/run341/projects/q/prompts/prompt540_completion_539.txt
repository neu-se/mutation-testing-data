  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed as an argument to `fulfilled.apply`, which would likely cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled.resolve` would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
