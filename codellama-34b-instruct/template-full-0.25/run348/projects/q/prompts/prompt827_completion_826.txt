  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, and setting it to `null` would prevent it from being called, potentially causing errors to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown whenever `Q.onerror` is called, which could cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console whenever `Q.onerror` is called, which could cause the program to produce different output or behave differently.

DONE.
