  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which means the regular expression will match all occurrences of the BOM character, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/gi, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gi` flags are added, which means the regular expression will match all occurrences of the BOM character, regardless of case, and will also match the BOM character at the beginning of the string, not just at the end.

DONE.
