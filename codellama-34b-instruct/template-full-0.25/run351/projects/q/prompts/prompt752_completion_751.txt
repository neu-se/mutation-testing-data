  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` object is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `deferred.reject` method with the `rejection` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `rejection` object as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `deferred.resolve` method with the `rejection` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `rejection` object as the value.

DONE.
