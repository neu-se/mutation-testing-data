  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the string "/default.pdf" at the end of the URL, while the new code fragment matches the string "/default.pdf" anywhere in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is case-insensitive, while the original code fragment is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is a global match, while the original code fragment is a non-global match.

DONE.
