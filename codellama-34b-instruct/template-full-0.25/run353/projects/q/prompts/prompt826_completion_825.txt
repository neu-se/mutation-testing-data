  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise, which would be passed to `makeStackTraceLong` instead of the original `error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the callback if the original promise is fulfilled, or rejected with the result of the callback if the original promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the callback if the original promise is fulfilled, or rejected with the result of the callback if the original promise is rejected.

DONE.
