  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, regardless of the other's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` when both `this` and `z` are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, or when both are zero.

DONE.
