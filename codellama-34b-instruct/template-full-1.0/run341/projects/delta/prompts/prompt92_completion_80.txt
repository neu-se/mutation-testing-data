  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the code inside the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to `true`, and the code inside the `if` statement would always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only be true if `index` is equal to `0`, regardless of the length of the `ops` array.

DONE.
