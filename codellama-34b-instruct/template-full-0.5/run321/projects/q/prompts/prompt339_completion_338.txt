  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not a promise, and does not have a `state` property that can be checked for fulfillment. The `inspected` object is a plain object that is returned by the `inspect` function, and it does not have the same properties as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not a promise, and does not have a `state` property that can be checked for rejection. The `inspected` object is a plain object that is returned by the `inspect` function, and it does not have the same properties as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected` object is not a promise
