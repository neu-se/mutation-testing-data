  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `+` operator, which would concatenate the string "1" with the value of `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, resulting in a string like "1,2,3". In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `-` operator, which would subtract the value of `array_slice(arguments, 1)` from the string "1", resulting in a different string like "1-2-3".
