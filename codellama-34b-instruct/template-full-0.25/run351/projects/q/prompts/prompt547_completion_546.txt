  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that can be used to throw an exception, whereas `reject` is a method that can be used to reject a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that can be used to resolve a promise, whereas `reject` is a method that can be used to reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a method that can be used to reject a promise, whereas `reject` is a method that can be used to reject a promise.

DONE.
