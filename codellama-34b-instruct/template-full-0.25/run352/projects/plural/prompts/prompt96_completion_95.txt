  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is reversed, so "woman" would become "woman" instead of "women".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is not limited to the first occurrence of "a", so "woman" would become "womens" instead of "women".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is not limited to the first occurrence of "a", so "woman" would become "womenses" instead of "women".

DONE.
