  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys` method would return an empty array instead of an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys` method would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys` method would return an array of keys, but the `values` function would be called with an undefined argument.

DONE.
