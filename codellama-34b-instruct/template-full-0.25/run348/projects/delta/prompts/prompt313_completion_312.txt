  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the operation, causing the delta to be deleted instead of retained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the operation, causing the delta to be retained instead of inverted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain(Op.length(op))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire operation, causing the delta to be retained instead of inverted.

DONE.
