  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method expects the `longitude` property to be present, but if it is replaced with `'latitude'`, the method will throw an error because the `latitude` property is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method expects the `longitude` property to be a number, but if it is replaced with `'longitude' + 1`, the method will throw an error because the resulting value is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method expects the `longitude` property to be a number between -180 and 180, but if it is replaced with `Math.PI`, the method will throw an error because the resulting value is outside of this range.
