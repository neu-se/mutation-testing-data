  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass both the error and value to the nodeback function, whereas the original code only passed the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the nodeback function, whereas the original code passed the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null error to the nodeback function, whereas the original code passed the actual error.

DONE.
