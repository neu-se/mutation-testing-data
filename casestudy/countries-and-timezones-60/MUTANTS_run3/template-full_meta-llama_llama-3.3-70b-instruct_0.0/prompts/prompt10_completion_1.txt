Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset / 120
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the divisor from 60 to 120, which would incorrectly calculate the hours from the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the ceiling function instead of the floor function, which would round up to the nearest whole number instead of down.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the minutes variable instead of the offset variable, which would incorrectly calculate the hours.

DONE.
