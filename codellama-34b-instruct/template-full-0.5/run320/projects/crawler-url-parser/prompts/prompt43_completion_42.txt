  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with the `true` option to parse the query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with the `null` option to parse the query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would not be called with the string `"hello"` as the second argument.

DONE.
