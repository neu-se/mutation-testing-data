 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof isNodeFrame !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `isNodeFrame` instead of its value, potentially causing the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false`, potentially masking issues related to internal frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `isNodeFrame` function with a function that always returns `true`, potentially causing the `isInternalFrame` function to incorrectly identify non-internal frames as internal frames.

DONE.
