  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a different method than `push`, and it would modify the array in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a different method than `push`, and it would modify the array in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a different method than `push`, and it would modify the array in a different way.

DONE.
