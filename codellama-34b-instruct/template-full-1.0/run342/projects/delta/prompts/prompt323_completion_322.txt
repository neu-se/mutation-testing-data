  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the ` + 1` would cause the loop to start at the next index instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIndex` is a different variable from `baseIndex` and could potentially have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is a different variable from `baseIndex` and could potentially have a different value.

DONE.
