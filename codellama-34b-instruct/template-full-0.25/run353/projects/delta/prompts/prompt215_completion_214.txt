  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the given array or string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 0, other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array, while `concat()` creates a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(...other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds elements to the end of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the given array or string.

DONE.
