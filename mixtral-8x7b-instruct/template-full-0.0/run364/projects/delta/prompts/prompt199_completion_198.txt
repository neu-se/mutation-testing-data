 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the outer iterator instead of the inner iterator for the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing an infinite loop in the `diff()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always advances the iterator by 1 operation, potentially skipping or removing operations in the `Delta` object.

DONE.
