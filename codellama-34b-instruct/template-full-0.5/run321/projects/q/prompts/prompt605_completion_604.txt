  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, but the original code does not use `bind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.call(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` immediately invokes the function with a specific context, but the original code does not use `call`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.apply(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` immediately invokes the function with a specific context and arguments, but the original code does not use `apply`.

DONE.
