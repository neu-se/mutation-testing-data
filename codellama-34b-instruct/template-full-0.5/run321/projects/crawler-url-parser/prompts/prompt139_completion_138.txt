  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

DONE.
