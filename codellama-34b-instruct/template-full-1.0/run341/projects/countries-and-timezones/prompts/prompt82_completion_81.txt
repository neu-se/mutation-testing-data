  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() => null` function always returns `null`, regardless of the input. In contrast, the original function `(c) => getCountry(c, options)` returns a value based on the input `c` and the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function takes a different argument than `getCountry`. The `getTimezone` function takes a `name` argument, whereas `getCountry` takes an `id` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function has a different set of default options when called with the `deprecated` option set to `true`. In particular, the `allTimezones` property will be
