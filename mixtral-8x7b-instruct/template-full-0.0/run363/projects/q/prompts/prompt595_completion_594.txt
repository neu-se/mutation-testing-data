 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty array as the arguments to the callback function, whereas the original code passes the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the arguments to the callback function, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior in the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an object with a `foo` property as the arguments to the callback function, which is unlikely to be the expected argument type, causing errors or unexpected behavior in the callback function.

DONE.
