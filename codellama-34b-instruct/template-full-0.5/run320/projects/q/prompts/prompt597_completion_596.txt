  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not being called, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object or with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).post
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is being replaced with the `post` method, which could cause different behavior if the `post` method is implemented differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is being replaced with the `resolve` method, which could cause different behavior if the `resolve` method is implemented differently.

DONE.
