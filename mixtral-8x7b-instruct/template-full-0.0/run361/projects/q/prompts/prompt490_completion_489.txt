 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, leaving the rejection untracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called, leaving the rejection untracked. In JavaScript, a non-empty array is truthy, but `0` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
untrackRejection.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context (`this`) of the `untrackRejection` function, potentially causing issues if the function relies on the correct context.

DONE.
