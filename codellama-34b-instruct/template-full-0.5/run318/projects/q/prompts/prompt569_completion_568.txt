  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason, while `errback` is a function that handles errors in a promise chain. Using `reject` instead of `errback` would cause the promise chain to be rejected, instead of being handled by the error handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason, while `errback` is a function that handles errors in a promise chain. Using `Q
