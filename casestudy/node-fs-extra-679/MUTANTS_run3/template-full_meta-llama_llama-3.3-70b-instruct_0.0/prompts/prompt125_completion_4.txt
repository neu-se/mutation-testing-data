Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an error that is not handled by the existing error handling mechanisms, potentially causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, { srcStat, destStat: srcStat })
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the source stat as the destination stat, potentially causing incorrect results or further errors downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a successful callback without any error or result, potentially causing the program to hang or behave unexpectedly due to the lack of information.

DONE.
