  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be bound to the `Promise` object, while `void 0` would result in `undefined` being bound.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [globalThis, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `globalThis` would be bound to the global object (or undefined in strict mode), while `void 0` would result in `undefined` being bound.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [object, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` would be passed as the `this` context, while `void 0` would result in `undefined` being passed.

DONE.
