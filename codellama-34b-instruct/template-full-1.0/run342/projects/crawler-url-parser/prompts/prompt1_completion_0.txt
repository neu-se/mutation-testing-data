  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression only matches letters, numbers, and a few special characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\^\.\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the caret character (^) and the dot character (.).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test .trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression only matches the trim
