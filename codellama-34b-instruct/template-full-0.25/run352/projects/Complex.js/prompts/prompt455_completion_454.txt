  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isNaN']`, causing the `toString` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` would return `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isZero']` would return `true` if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, whereas the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
