 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the encoding, which may cause issues when reading files with specific encoding requirements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default encoding to 'utf8', which may not match the desired encoding in some cases, causing issues when reading or writing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes null as the encoding, which may cause issues when reading files with specific encoding requirements.

These changes create opportunities for mutation testing by introducing different behaviors that could potentially expose weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
