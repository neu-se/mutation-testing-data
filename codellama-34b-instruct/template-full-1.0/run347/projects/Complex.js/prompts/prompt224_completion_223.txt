  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a < 0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the square root when `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while the modified code computes the square root when `a` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b <= 0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the square root when `b` is greater than or equal to 0, while the modified code computes the square root when `b` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a !== 1```
This would result in different behavior because the original code computes the square root only when `a` is 1, while the modified code computes the square root when `a` is not 1.

DONE.
