  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the sign of the absolute value, which could cause the function to always return a negative result, even if the input value is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add one to the absolute value, which could cause the function to always return a positive result, even if the input value is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract one from the absolute value, which could cause the function to always return a negative result, even if the input value is positive.

DONE.
