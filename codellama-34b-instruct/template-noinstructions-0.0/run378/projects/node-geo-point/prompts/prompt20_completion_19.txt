  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for `null`, causing the `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for `undefined`, causing the `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `true` for an empty object, causing the `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
