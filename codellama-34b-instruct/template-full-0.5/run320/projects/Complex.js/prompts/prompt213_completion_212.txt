  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` has a different value than the new code fragment `a + b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` has a different value than the new code fragment `a - b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` has a different value than the new code fragment `2 * a`.

DONE.
