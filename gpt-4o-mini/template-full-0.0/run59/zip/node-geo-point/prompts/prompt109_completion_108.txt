Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3 + zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 3 to the zoom level instead of using it directly, which would lead to incorrect tile calculations and potentially return tiles that do not correspond to the intended zoom level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the zoom level by 2 instead of using it directly, which would cause the tile calculations to be based on an incorrect scale, resulting in tiles that are twice as zoomed in as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the zoom level, which would lead to a lower zoom level being used in the tile calculations, resulting in tiles that are less detailed than expected.

DONE.
