  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is now starting from index 2 instead of index 1, which would cause the last part of the path to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(0, -1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is now stopping at index -1 instead of the end of the array, which would cause the first part of the path to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.join('/').split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method is now combining the elements of the array with '/' instead of the original character, which could cause the path to be invalid.

DONE.
