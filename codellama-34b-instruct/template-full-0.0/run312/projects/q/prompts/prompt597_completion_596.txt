  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific context and arguments, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific context and arguments, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one passed as an argument.

DONE.
