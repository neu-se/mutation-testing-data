  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the error, rather than being rejected with it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, rather than passing it to the promise's reject method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a progress notification, rather than an error.

DONE.
