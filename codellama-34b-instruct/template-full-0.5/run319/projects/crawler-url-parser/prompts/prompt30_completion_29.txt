  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/` is not the same as `/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/i`. The latter includes the `i` flag, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive. This means that the code would not match URLs that start with "HTTPS" or "https" in the same way as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
