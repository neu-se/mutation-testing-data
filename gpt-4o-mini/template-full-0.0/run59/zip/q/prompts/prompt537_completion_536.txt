Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of the expected `value`, leading to a failure in the fulfillment callback that expects a valid value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined`, which would cause the fulfillment callback to receive `undefined` instead of the actual value, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Promise rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one, causing the rejected callback to be invoked instead of the fulfilled callback, altering the flow of promise handling.

DONE.
