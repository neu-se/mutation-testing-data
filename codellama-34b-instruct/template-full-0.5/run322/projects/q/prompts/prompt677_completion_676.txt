  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise` object, rather than `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `this` value, rather than `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would be used instead of `apply`, which would pass the arguments individually rather than as an array.

DONE.
