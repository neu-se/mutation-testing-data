  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array containing the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array containing the names of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries

```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array containing the names of all of the object's own properties, including non-enumerable and inherited properties, while `Object.keys
