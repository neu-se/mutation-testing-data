  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code, as it will add 180 degrees to the bearing before calculating the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code, as it will double the bearing before calculating the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code, as it will subtract 180 degrees from the bearing before calculating the destination point.

DONE.
