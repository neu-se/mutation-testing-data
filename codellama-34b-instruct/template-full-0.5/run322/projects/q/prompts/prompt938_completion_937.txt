  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the wrong index to access the arguments array, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the wrong variable name to access the arguments array, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the wrong index to access the arguments array, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
