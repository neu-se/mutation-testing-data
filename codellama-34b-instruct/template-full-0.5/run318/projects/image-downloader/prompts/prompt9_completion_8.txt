  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.normalize` returns the normalized path of a file, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a file.

DONE.
