  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is a different property than `options.dest`, and it may not be a valid destination for the image download.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the `options.dest` property, which may not be a valid destination for the image download.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the directory name of the `options.dest` property, which may not be a valid destination for the image download.

DONE.
