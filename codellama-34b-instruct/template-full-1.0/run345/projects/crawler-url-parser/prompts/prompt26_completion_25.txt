  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
//#.*$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is changed. The original code matched and removed anchor tags (#) followed by any character (.) and the end ($) of the string. However, the new code would match and keep the anchor tags followed by any character and the end of the string, which would result in the baseURL not being stripped of any anchor tags.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
‘/#.*$/, /#’
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is changed. The original code matched and removed anchor tags (#) followed by any character (.) and the end ($) of the string. However, the new code would match and keep the anchor tags (#) followed by any character and the end of the string, which would result in the path not being stripped of any anchor tags.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '/#test'
```
