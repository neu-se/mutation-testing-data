  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `d`, and the expression would evaluate to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.d
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.d` is a different property than `d`, and the expression would evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
