  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` operator would always return `true`, even if `p` is a promise that is eventually resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.isRejected(); p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected()` method would always return `false`, even if `p` is a promise that is eventually rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.isFulfilled(); p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled()` method would always return `false`, even if `p` is a promise that is eventually resolved.

DONE.
