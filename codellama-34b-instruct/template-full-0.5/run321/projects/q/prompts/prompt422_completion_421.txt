  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the `object`, potentially causing the `isFulfilled` function to return the opposite value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and the `isFulfilled` function would return `false` for `undefined`, whereas it would return `true` for `object` with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and the `isFulfilled` function would return `false` for `null`, whereas it would return `true` for `object` with the original code fragment.

DONE.
