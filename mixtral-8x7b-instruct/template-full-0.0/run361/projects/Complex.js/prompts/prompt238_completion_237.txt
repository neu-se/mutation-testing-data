 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is changed, which is not consistent with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result is always 0, which is not consistent with the original code fragment that calculates the imaginary part based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number is used instead of the calculated value, which is not consistent with the original code fragment.

DONE.
