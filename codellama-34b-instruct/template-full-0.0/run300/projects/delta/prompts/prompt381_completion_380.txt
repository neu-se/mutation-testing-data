  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move to the next element in the iteration, which could potentially cause the `transform` method to skip over certain operations in the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to return the next element in the iteration without moving the iterator forward, which could potentially cause the `transform` method to process the same operation multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to move to the previous element in the iteration, which could potentially cause the `transform` method to process operations out of order.

DONE.
