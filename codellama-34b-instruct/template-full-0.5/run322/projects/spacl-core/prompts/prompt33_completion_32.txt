  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part` variable would always be `null`, causing the `switch` statement to fall through to the default case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part` variable would always be `0`, causing the `switch` statement to fall through to the default case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.slice(1).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part` variable would be assigned the reversed version of the `spec` variable, which would cause the `switch` statement to evaluate different values.

DONE.
