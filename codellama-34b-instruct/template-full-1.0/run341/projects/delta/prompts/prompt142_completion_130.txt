  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```console.log(this.ops);```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the `ops` array to the console, but the original code does not have any logging statements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```return this.ops.slice(start, end);```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array instead of a new `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```return new Delta(this.ops.slice(start, end));```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` object from a slice of the `ops` array, but the original code creates a new `Delta` object from the entire `ops` array.

DONE.
