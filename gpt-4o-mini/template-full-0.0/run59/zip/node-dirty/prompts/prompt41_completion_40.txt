Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to apply the provided function to the value instead of the key, potentially leading to incorrect processing of the data stored in the `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the key by appending '1' to it, causing the `forEach` method to iterate over a non-existent key, which would not match any entries in the `_data` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to the function, which would not represent any valid key in the `_data` map, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in the function logic.

DONE.
