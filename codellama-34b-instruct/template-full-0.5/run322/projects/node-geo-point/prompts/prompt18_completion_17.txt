  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object` would check if the variable `object` is falsy, whereas the original code `!isObject(object)` checks if the variable `object` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object === null` would check if the variable `object` is null, whereas the original code `!isObject(object)` checks if the variable `object` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object !== 'object'` would check if the variable `object` is not of type object, whereas the original code `!isObject(object)` checks if the variable `object` is not an object.

DONE.
