  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This change will cause the `sign` method to always return a complex number with a real part equal to the original complex number's real part, and an imaginary part equal to zero. This will result in the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods always returning a complex number with a real part equal to the original complex number's real part, and an imaginary part equal to zero, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `sign` method to always return a complex number with a real part equal to the original complex number's real part, and an imaginary part equal to one. This will result in the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods always returning a complex number with a real part equal to the original complex number's real part, and an imaginary part equal to one, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
