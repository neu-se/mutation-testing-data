  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by `length` elements, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator backward by one element, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
