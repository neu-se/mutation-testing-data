  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `retain` attribute, causing the `invert` method to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only invert the `retain` attribute if the `attributes` object has a non-zero length, which could cause the `invert` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only invert the `retain` attribute if the `attributes` object has more than one element, which could cause the `invert` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
