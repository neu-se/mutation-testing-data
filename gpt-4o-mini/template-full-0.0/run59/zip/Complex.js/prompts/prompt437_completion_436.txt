Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the base of the power calculation from 10 to 2, which would affect the scaling of the complex number's real and imaginary parts, leading to incorrect ceiling values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']), places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the absolute value of the real part of the complex number instead of a constant, which would lead to inconsistent scaling based on the value of the real part rather than a fixed decimal place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 10, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a random factor into the calculation, meaning the scaling factor would change unpredictably each time the function is called, leading to non-deterministic results for the ceiling operation.

DONE.
