  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a function reference, but `null` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a function reference, but `undefined` is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a function reference, but `() => {}` is a function expression and would result in a different execution path.

DONE.
