  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data
```

This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` argument as the `err` argument to the callback function, which would cause the callback function to read the data as an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```

This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the `err` argument to the callback function, which would cause the callback function to read the data as the result of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data
```

This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `err` argument to the callback function, which would cause the callback function to read the data as an error.

DONE.
