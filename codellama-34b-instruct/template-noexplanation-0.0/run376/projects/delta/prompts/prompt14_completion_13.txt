  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This code fragment will return the number of keys in the `attributes` object, which is not the same as the number of keys in the `attributes` object that have a value that is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).filter(key => attributes[key] !== undefined).length
```
This code fragment will return the number of keys in the `attributes` object that have a value that is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).reduce((count, key) => count + (attributes[key] !== undefined ? 1 : 0), 0)
```
This code fragment will return the number of keys in the `attributes` object that have a value that is not `undefined`, using the `reduce` method to iterate over the keys and increment a counter for each key that has a value that is not `undefined`.

DONE.
