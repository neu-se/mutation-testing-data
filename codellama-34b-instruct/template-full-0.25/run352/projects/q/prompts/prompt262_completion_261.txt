  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
