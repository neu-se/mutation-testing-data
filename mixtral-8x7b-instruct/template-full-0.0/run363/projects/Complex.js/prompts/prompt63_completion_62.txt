 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the trigonometric function used to calculate the real part of the complex number would change from cosine to sine, which would produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the trigonometric function used to calculate the real part of the complex number would change from cosine to hyperbolic cosine, which would produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by the cosine of the angle would be replaced by a constant value of 1, which would produce incorrect results.

DONE.
