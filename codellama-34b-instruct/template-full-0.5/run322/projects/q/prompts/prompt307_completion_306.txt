  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the result of `Q(answerPs[i])`, rather than the original code which resolves the promise with the result of `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve).catch(reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch any errors that occur during the execution of `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve)` and reject the promise with the error, rather than the original code which would only reject the promise if an error occurs during the execution of `Q(answerPs[i])`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function(result) {
    resolve(result);
}, function(error) {
    reject
