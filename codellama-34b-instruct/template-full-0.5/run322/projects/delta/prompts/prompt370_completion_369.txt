  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a mutator method that removes the last element from the delta, whereas `retain` is a mutator method that retains the last element in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a mutator method that adds an element to the end of the delta, whereas `retain` is a mutator method that retains the last element in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a mutator method that adds an element to the beginning of the delta, whereas `retain` is a mutator method that retains the last element in the delta.

DONE.
