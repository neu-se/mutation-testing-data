Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `false` to the `read` function, which could lead to the stream not being read correctly, potentially causing the process to hang or not execute as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass `true` to the `read` function if `abort` is truthy, which could prevent the stream from being read if an abort condition is met, leading to incomplete processing of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `read` function could cause it to interpret the input incorrectly, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the stream processing logic.

DONE.
