  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the one specified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called on the `this._data` object with the `key` variable as the argument, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the one specified.

DONE.
