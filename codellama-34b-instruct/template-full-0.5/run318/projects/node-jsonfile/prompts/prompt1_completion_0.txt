  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this new code fragment checks if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is set to `'utf8'`.

DONE.
