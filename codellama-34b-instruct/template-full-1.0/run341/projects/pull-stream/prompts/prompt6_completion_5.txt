  Sure, here are three possible options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs[k]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of the `throughs` object, rather than the keys of the `throughs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the number of elements in the `throughs` array, rather than the keys of the `throughs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `throughs` object, rather than the keys of the `throughs` object.

DONE.
