  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, but with `resolved`, it would be called when the promise is resolved, which could cause unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, but with `fulfilled`, it would be called when the promise is fulfilled, which could cause unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, but with `rejected`, it would be called when the promise is rejected, which could cause unintended consequences.

DONE.
