  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the condition to always be true if `op` is truthy and `data` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the condition to always be true if `op` is truthy and `data` is falsy, and also if `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `==`, which would cause the condition to always be true if `op` is truthy and `data` is falsy, and also
