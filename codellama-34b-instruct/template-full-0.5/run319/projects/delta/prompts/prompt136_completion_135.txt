  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return a different value, potentially causing the code to produce a different output or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return a different value, potentially causing the code to produce a different output or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return a different value, potentially causing the code to produce a different output or error.

DONE.
