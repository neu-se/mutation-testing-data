 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` immediately returns a resolved promise, while the original code uses the `Q` function which might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Timeout'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise with a timeout error, while the original code waits for the specified timeout period before rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred promise, while the original code returns the promise passed as an argument.

DONE.
