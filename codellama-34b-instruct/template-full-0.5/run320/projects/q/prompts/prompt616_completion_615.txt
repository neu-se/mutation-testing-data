  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `null` instead of the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a string instead of the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `null` instead of the promise object.

DONE.
