  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `Math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b
```
This code fragment calculates the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, but it does not take the square root of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a * a + b * b, 0.5)
```
This code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
