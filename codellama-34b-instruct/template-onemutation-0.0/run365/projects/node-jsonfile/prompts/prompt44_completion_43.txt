  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function that is used to transform the JSON data before it is parsed, whereas `options` is an object that contains various options for the `JSON.parse()` method. Using `options.reviver` instead of `options` would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to be called with a different set of options, which could result in different behavior.
