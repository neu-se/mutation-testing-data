  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"SOME_RANDOM_STRING"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file path to a different directory, which would cause the `access` call to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + ".txt"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a ".txt" extension to the file path, which would cause the `access` call to fail if the file does not have a ".txt" extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toString() + " BUGS"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the file path to a different value, which would cause the `access` call to fail.

DONE.
