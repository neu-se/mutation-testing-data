  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` and `thisIter.peekLength` may return different values, leading to a different outcome in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(otherIter.peekLength || thisIter.peekLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the method to return `thisIter.peekLength` if `otherIter.peekLength` is `0` or `null`, which could lead to a different outcome in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(otherIter.peekLength + thisIter.peekLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the method to return a different value, leading to a different outcome in the `transform` method.

DONE.
