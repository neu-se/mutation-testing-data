  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment refers to the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the real part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the real part.

DONE.
