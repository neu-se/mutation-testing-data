  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("New error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error("New error message")` is a new error object with a different message than the original `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `exception` is a truthy object.

DONE.
