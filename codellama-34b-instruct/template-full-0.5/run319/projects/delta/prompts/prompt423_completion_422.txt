  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `length` variable as a multiplier for the `index - offset` expression, while this code fragment uses addition instead of multiplication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - (index - offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `length` variable as a multiplier for the `index - offset` expression, while this code fragment uses subtraction instead of multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(length + index) - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `length` variable as a multiplier for the `index - offset` expression, while this code fragment uses addition instead of multiplication and then subtracts the `offset` variable.

DONE.
