  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(this.offset, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `this.offset` value as the starting position for the substring, instead of using the `length` value as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(length, this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `length` value as the starting position for the substring, instead of using the `this.offset` value as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(this.offset + length, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `this.offset + length` value as the starting position for the substring, instead of using the `this.offset` value as in the original code.

DONE.
