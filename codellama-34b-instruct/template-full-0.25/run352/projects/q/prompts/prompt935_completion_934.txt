  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null)` is a bound function that returns a new array without the first element, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(null)` is a function call that returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array without the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(null)` is a function call that returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array without the first element
