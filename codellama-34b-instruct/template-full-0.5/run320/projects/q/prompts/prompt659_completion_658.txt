  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `dispatch` method as `undefined`, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string as the second argument of the `dispatch` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the second argument of the `dispatch` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
