Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination file has a specific extension ('.jpg') instead of checking if it has no extension, which could lead to skipping the filename extraction for valid destinations that do not end with '.jpg'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url.includes('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the URL does not contain 'http', which would incorrectly allow extraction of the filename for non-HTTP URLs, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination string has any length instead of checking for the absence of an extension, which could allow filename extraction even when the destination is not a valid file path.

DONE.
