  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the type of `ReturnValue` is not "undefined", while this new code fragment checks if the type of `ReturnValue` is not "number".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the type of `ReturnValue` is not "undefined", while this new code fragment checks if the type of `ReturnValue` is not "string".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the type of `ReturnValue` is not "undefined", while this new code fragment checks if the type of `ReturnValue` is not "boolean".

DONE.
