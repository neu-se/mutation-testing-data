  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be split into two separate lines, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be split into two separate lines, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be split into two separate lines, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

DONE.
