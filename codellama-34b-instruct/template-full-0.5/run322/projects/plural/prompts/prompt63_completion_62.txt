  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while 'bacteria' is the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while 'bacterium' + 's' would result in the string 'bacteriums', which is not a valid plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word, while 'bacteria' + 's' would result in the string 'bacterias', which is not a valid plural form of the word.

DONE.
