  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the text, rather than the entire text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the text to lowercase, which could affect the accuracy of the link extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all non-word and non-whitespace characters from the text, which could affect the accuracy of the link extraction.

DONE.
