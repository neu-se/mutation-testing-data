  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.contains
```
This would result in different behavior because `contains` is a static method that returns a boolean indicating whether a string contains a specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the specified value in the string. As a result, the modified code would check whether `stackLine` contains `"(node.js:"` instead of checking if it starts with the substring `"(node.js:"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("(node.js:")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split `stackLine` on `"(node.js:"` and return the first element of the resulting array, whereas the original code returns the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.startsWith("(node.js:")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `stackLine` starts with `"(node.js:"`, whereas the original code checks for the
