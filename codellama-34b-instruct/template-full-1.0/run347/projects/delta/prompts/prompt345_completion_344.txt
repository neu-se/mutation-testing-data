  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.insert` is a function that inserts a new element into the document tree, while `handler.invert` is a function that inverts the colors of an HTML element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.remove
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.remove` is a function that removes an element from the document tree, while `handler.invert` is a function that inverts the colors of an HTML element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.toggle
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.toggle` is a function that toggles the visibility of an HTML element, while `handler.invert` is a function that inverts the colors of an HTML element.

DONE.
