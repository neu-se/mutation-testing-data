  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This code fragment is a negation of the original code fragment, and it has the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx) && rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This code fragment is a combination of the original code fragment and its negation, and it has a different behavior.

DONE.
