  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is being replaced with `reverse()`, which would result in the array being reversed instead of the first element being removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being replaced with an index access, which would result in only the first element of the array being returned instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` character is being replaced with a `.` character, which would cause the string to be split on dots instead of slashes.

DONE.
