  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function is called instead of `deliverCountry`, which would return a different set of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function is called instead of `deliverCountry`, which would return a different set of countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesForCountry` function is called instead of `deliverCountry`, which would return a different set of timezones.

DONE.
