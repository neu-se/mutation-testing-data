  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing in degrees, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing in radians.

DONE.
