Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if the promise's state is "rejected" instead of "fulfilled", leading to incorrect handling of promises and potentially causing the `all` function to resolve prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check for "pending" promises, which means that fulfilled promises would not be processed correctly, and the function could hang indefinitely if there are only pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use the value of the fulfilled promise in a mathematical operation, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the value is not a number, thus breaking the promise handling logic.

DONE.
