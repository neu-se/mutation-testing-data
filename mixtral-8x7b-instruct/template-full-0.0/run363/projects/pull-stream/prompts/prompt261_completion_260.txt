 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { cb(err) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would always be passed to the callback, even if it's not an actual error (e.g., when the `end` event is emitted).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the process would be terminated immediately upon receiving an error, instead of passing the error to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be logged to the console instead of being passed to the callback, which could cause the application to continue in an inconsistent state.

DONE.
