 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q object would be replaced with an empty object, changing the entire library's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Mutation testing error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q object would throw an error upon initialization, revealing potential issues with error handling in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { noop.apply(this, arguments); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the Q object would not have any methods or properties, as `noop` is an empty function. This would expose any tests that rely on the existence of specific methods or properties in the Q object.

DONE.
