  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` method to always return `true`, even if the two deltas being compared are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` method to always return `false`, even if the two deltas being compared are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` method to always return `true`, even if the two deltas being compared are different.

DONE.
