  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
