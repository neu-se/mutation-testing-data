  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the arguments passed to the Node function, which could potentially cause it to behave differently or produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the final argument to the Node function, which could cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass undefined as the final argument to the Node function, which could cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
