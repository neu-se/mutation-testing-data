  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `val` is not `undefined`. This would cause the `set` method to behave differently when `val` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if the type of `val` is `'undefined'`. This would cause the `set` method to behave differently when `val` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `val` is `null`. This would cause the `set` method to behave differently when `val` is `null`.

DONE.
