  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min++` statement would increment the `min` variable, potentially causing the `flatten()` function to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max--
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max--` statement would decrement the `max` variable, potentially causing the `flatten()` function to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts.push('*')` statement would add a literal `*` character to the `parts` array, potentially causing the `flatten()` function to produce different results.

DONE.
