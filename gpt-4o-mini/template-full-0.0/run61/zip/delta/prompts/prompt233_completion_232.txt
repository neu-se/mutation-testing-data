Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to attempt to read one more element than available in the `otherIter`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the operation being processed, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations and potentially cause data corruption or unexpected results in the `retDelta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to always take the maximum of the two lengths, which could lead to processing more operations than intended and potentially skipping necessary operations or causing mismatches in the delta.

DONE.
