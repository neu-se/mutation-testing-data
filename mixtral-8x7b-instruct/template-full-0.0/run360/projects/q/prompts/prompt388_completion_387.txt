 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because `.spread` is used to handle arrays of promises, not a single promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `.all` is used to wait for multiple promises to resolve, not a single promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `.race` is used to wait for the first promise to resolve, not a single promise.

DONE.
