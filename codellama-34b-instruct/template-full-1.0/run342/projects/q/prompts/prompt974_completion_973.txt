  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~object
```
This would result in different behavior because `~` is the bitwise NOT operator, which would produce a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this would add 1 to the original value, which could affect the result of the nmapply method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + object
```
This would result in different behavior because this would perform addition on the object with itself, which could produce a different result than simply returning the object.

DONE.
