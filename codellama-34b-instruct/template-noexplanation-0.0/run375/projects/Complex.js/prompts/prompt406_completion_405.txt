  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it swaps the arguments to `Math.atan2`, which will produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This code fragment is also a buggy version of the original code, as it adds `Math.PI` to the result of `Math.atan2`, which will produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) - Math.PI
```
This code fragment is also a buggy version of the original code, as it subtracts `Math.PI` from the result of `Math.atan2`, which will produce a different result.

DONE.
