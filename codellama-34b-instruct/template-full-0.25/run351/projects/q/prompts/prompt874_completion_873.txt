  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function. This would cause the `defer` function to throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but the function passed to it does not have any side effects. This would cause the `defer` function to return a promise that is immediately resolved with the value `undefined`, which would result in the `then` method being called with `undefined` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() { throw new Error("Test error") })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but the function passed to it throws an error
