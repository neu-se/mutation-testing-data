  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of `array_slice` is used to specify the end index of the slice, and by passing `2` as the third argument, the resulting array would only contain the first two elements of `arguments`, while the original code fragment would include all elements of `arguments` starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `array_slice` is used to specify the start index of the slice, and by passing `0` as the second argument, the resulting array would only contain the first element of `arguments`, while the original code fragment would include all elements of `arguments` starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different
