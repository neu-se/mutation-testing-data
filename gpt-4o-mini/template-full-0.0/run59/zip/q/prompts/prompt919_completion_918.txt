Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of creating a Node-style resolver, it would immediately reject the promise, leading to a failure in the promise chain instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately without waiting for the Node-style callback to be invoked, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty function as the callback instead of a proper Node-style resolver, which would not handle the result or error correctly, causing the promise to hang indefinitely.

DONE.
