  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the sum of `a` and `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the individual values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
