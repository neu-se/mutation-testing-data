  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to always return an empty `Delta` object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to always return a `Delta` object with the same attributes as the input `other` object, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes, other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to always return a `Delta` object with the same attributes as the input `other` object, regardless of the input.

DONE.
