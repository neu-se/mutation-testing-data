  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes null as the first argument to the generate function, while the mutated version passes the result of the generate function as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the result of the generate function as the second argument, while the mutated version passes the result of the generate function plus 1 as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(null, generate)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes null as the first argument and the result of the generate function as the second argument, while the mutated version passes null as the first argument and the generate function itself as the second argument.

DONE.
