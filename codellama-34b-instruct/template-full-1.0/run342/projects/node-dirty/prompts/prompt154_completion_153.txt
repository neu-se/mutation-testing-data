  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always cork the stream, even if there is no data to write, leading to a potential deadlock.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always uncork the stream, even if there is data to write, leading to potential data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._queue.size === 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uncork the stream only if there is no data to write, leading to potential data loss.

DONE.
