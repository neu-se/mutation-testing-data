Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue iterating even when `index` is equal to `length`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access on the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to attempt to access an element at `length`, which is outside the valid range of indices for the array, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate immediately if `index` is already greater than or equal to `length`, effectively skipping the entire reduction process and returning `undefined` or the initial value without processing any elements.

DONE.
