  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of whether `value` is a promise or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which may not necessarily be the same as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` checks if a promise is in the "pending" state, which may not necessarily be the same as whether it is a promise or not.

DONE.
