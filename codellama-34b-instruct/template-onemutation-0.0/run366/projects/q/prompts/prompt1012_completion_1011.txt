  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);` which is a promise-based approach, while the new code fragment uses `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);` which is a callback-based approach.

DONE.
