  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original check for an array, allowing non-array values to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the array is empty, rather than checking if it is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is not an object, rather than checking if it is an array.

DONE.
