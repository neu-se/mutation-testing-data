  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "wrong_name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of the expected timezone object, as the `name` parameter would not match any of the timezone names in the `data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name + "wrong_suffix"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of the expected timezone object, as the `name` parameter would not match any of the timezone names in the `data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of the expected timezone object, as the `name` parameter would not match any of the timezone names in the `data` object.

DONE.
