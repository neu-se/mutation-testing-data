  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the real part of the complex number before multiplying it by `places`, which could lead to different rounding errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * (places + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by an incremented value of `places`, which could lead to different rounding errors.

DONE.
