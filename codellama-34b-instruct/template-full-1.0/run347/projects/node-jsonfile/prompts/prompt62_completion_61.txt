  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the content would be converted to a number and then incremented by 1, resulting in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the content would be truncated to a shorter string, starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.from(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the content would be converted to a Buffer, which would then be passed to JSON.parse.

DONE.
