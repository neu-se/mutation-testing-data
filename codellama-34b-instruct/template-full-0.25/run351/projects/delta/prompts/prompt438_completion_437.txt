  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the mutated code checks if it's a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is a string, for example if it's a string representation of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the mutated code checks if it's an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is an object, for example if it's an array or a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp
