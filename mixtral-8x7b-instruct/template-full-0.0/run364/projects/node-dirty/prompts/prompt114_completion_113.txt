 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loadd'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now 'loadd' instead of 'load', so the event listener will not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument '1' is passed to the event listener, which is not expected and may cause errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
