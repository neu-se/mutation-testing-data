  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Q(deferred). makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `defer` function is used to create a new promise, whereas in this modified code, the `deferred` object is passed to the `Q` function as an argument, which would likely never happen in the context of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Q(true).then(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `defer` function is used to create a new promise, whereas in this modified code, the `Q` function is used to create a new promise that always resolves to `true`, which would likely never happen in the context of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Q(deferred).then(null, deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the
