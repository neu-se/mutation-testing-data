Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to get a country with the ID 'unknown', which likely does not exist in the data, leading to a null return instead of the expected country based on the provided `countryId`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `countryId` by appending '1' to it, which would likely reference a different country ID that does not exist, resulting in a null return instead of the correct country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `countryId` to uppercase, which may not match the casing of the keys in the `data.countries` object, potentially leading to a null return if the country ID is case-sensitive.

DONE.
