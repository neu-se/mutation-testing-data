  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` key exists in the `result` object and if the `current` array in that key has a length greater than 0, rather than simply checking if the key exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` key exists in the `result` object and if the `all` array in that key has a length greater than 0, rather than simply checking if the key exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]?.current?.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `country` key exists in the `result` object and if the `current` array in that key has a length greater than 0, but it would also handle the case where the `
