  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `country` is `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `country` is any falsy value (e.g., `false`, `0`, `""`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `country` is an empty string, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `country` is any falsy value (e.g., `false`, `0`, `""`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `country` is not defined, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `country` is any falsy value (e.g., `false`, `0`, `""`).
