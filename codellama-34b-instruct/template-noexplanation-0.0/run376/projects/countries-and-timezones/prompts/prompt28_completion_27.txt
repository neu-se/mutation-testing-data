  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This will cause the offset to be rounded up to the nearest integer, rather than down.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This will cause the offset to be rounded to the nearest integer, rather than down.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60
```
This will cause the offset to be divided by 60, rather than rounded.

DONE.
