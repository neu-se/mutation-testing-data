  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` instead of the logical AND operator `&&`. This change will cause the `output` variable to be assigned the value of `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` if it is truthy, and the value of `targetFilePath` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` instead of the logical AND operator `&&`. This change will cause the `output` variable to be assigned the value of `targetFilePath` if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is falsy, and the value of `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream ? targetFilePath : null
```
This code fragment uses the ternary operator
