  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment calls the `defer` function with `null` as an argument, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment calls the `defer` function with `undefined` as an argument, which would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment calls the `defer` function with `true` as an argument, which would likely throw an error.

DONE.
