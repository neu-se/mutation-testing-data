  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the data as is, while the mutated code logs the data in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the data, while the mutated code logs the length of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the data, while the mutated code logs the first word of the data.

DONE.
