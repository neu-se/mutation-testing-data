 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a specific function that does nothing when called, while an empty function declaration like this one may not behave the same way in certain contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a value, not a function, so it would cause an error when the `when` function tries to call it as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` is a function that returns a random number between 0 and 1, not a function that does nothing like `noop`. This would cause the `when` function to behave differently, as it would pass the random number to the `onRejected` function instead of just resolving the promise.

DONE.
