  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is the special `NaN` (Not a Number) value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a method that checks if a value is the special `NaN` (Not a Number) value, whereas `isNaN` is a global function that checks if a value is the special `NaN` value or if it is a string that cannot be converted to a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` is a function that parses a string and returns a floating-point number, whereas `isNaN` is a function that checks if a value is the special `NaN` value.

DONE.
