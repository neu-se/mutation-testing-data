  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid value, but `null` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid value, but `undefined` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid value, but `42` is not.

DONE.
