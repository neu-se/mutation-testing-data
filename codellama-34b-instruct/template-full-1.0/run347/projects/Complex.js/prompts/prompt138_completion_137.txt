  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is positive or negative infinity, while `isFinite` returns `false` for both positive and negative infinity. Replacing `isInfinite` with `isFinite` would cause the `if` statement to be evaluated as `false` for numbers that are actually infinite, and the method would return `Complex.NAN`, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` returns `true` for positive or negative infinity, while `!isInfinite` returns `false` for both. Replacing `isInfinite` with `!isInfinite` would cause the `if` statement to be evaluated as `true` for numbers that are actually infinite, and the method would return `Complex.INFINITY`, which is incorrect.
