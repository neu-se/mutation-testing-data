  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.insert` inserts a new element at the end of the `inverted` array, whereas `inverted.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.pop` removes the last element from the `inverted` array, whereas `inverted.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.shift` removes the first element from the `inverted` array, whereas `inverted.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
