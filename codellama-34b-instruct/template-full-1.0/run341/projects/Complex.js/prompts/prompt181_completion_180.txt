  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re'] === 0` is not equivalent to `z['isZero']`. `z['isZero']` checks if the complex number is equal to zero, while `z['re'] === 0` only checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to zero. For example, if `z` is a complex number with `z['re'] = 0` and `z['im'] = 1`, then `z['isZero']` would return `false`, but `z['re'] === 0` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im'] === 0` is not equivalent to `z['isZero']`. `z['im'] === 0` only checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while `z['isZero']` checks if the
