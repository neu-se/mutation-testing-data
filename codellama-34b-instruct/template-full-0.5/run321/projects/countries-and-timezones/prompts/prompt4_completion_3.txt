  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `-0`, `NaN`, `false`, and the empty string. However, this new code fragment would only check if `timezonesMap` is `undefined`, which means it would not catch other falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap !== Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, which includes `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `-0`, `NaN`, `false`, and the empty string. However, this new code fragment would check if `timezonesMap` is not the `Object.prototype`, which means it would not catch other falsy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length ===
