  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it would likely cause the code to behave in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.retain` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it would likely cause the code to behave in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.delete` is a different function from `AttributeMap.invert`, and it would likely cause the code to behave in a different way.

DONE.
