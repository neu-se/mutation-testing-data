  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would be called with a base of 1 instead of 2, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would be called with a base of 2 and an exponent of `zoom + 1`, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would be called with a base of 2 and an exponent of `zoom - 1`, which would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

DONE.
