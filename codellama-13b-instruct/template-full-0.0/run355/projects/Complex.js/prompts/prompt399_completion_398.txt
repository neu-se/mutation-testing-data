  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is not defined for complex numbers, and the `acosh` function is not defined for real numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function is not defined for complex numbers, and the `asinh` function is not defined for real numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function is not defined for complex numbers, and the `atanh` function is not defined for real numbers.

DONE.
