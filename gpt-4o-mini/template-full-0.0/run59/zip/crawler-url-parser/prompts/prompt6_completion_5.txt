Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `baseUrlStr` for illegal characters instead of the `currentUrlStr`, potentially allowing invalid URLs to pass through the validation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string "extra" to `currentUrlStr`, which would always result in a match for illegal characters, causing the function to return `null` even for valid URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts `currentUrlStr` to uppercase before checking for illegal characters, which could lead to false negatives if the illegal characters are in lowercase, thus allowing potentially invalid URLs to be accepted.

DONE.
