  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:0)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always match the first line of the stack trace, which may not be the line that contains the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always match the second line of the stack trace, which may not be the line that contains the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:2)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always match the third line of the stack trace, which may not be the line that contains the error.

DONE.
