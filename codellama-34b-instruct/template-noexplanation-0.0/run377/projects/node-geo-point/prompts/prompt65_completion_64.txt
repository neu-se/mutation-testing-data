  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This code fragment will add 180 degrees to the longitude difference, which will result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This code fragment will double the longitude difference, which will result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This code fragment will subtract 180 degrees from the longitude difference, which will result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
