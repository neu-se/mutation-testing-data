  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be used as the arguments to `array_slice()`, which would return an empty array, while the original code would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because a hardcoded array of numbers would be used as the arguments to `array_slice()`, which would return a new array containing the elements of the original array from index `1` to index `3`, while the original code would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[i for (i in arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because a generator expression would be used to create a new array containing the indices of the elements in the original `arguments` object, while the original code would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function.
