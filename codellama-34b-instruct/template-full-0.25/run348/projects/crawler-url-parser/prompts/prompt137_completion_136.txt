  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a forward slash, which is used to indicate a directory or path, while the replacement code fragment is a backslash, which is used to escape characters in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a forward slash, which is used to indicate a directory or path, while the replacement code fragment is a space, which is used to separate words or phrases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a forward slash, which is used to indicate a directory or path, while the replacement code fragment is a hash symbol, which is used to indicate a comment or annotation in some programming languages.

DONE.
