  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always refer to the first argument passed to the function, regardless of the actual value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the embed type, regardless of the actual value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` as the embed type, regardless of the actual value of `b`.

DONE.
