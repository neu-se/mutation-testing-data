  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `false` instead of `null` when the policy is not found, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `true` instead of `null` when the policy is not found, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Policy not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would throw an error instead of returning `null` when the policy is not found, which could cause the `query` method to throw an error instead of returning a result.

DONE.
