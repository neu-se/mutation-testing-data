 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream || null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `stream` variable is falsy, it will return `null` instead of the original value. This could potentially cause issues downstream if the consumers of this function are not expecting `null` as a possible value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `stream` array. If the downstream code modifies the original `stream` array, the changes will not be reflected in the copied array, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the elements of the `stream` array. Similar to Option 2, if the downstream code modifies the original `stream` array, the changes will not be reflected in the new array, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
