  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index + 1]` references the next operation in the sequence, whereas `this.next` references the next operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index - 1]` references the previous operation in the sequence, whereas `this.next` references the next operation in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[this.index + 2]` references the operation two positions after the current operation, whereas `this.next` references the next operation in the iteration.

DONE.
