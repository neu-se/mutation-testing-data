  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pop the first element from the `laterQueue` array, instead of the last element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pop the second element from the `laterQueue` array, instead of the last element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pop the last element from the `laterQueue` array, instead of the first element as intended.

DONE.
