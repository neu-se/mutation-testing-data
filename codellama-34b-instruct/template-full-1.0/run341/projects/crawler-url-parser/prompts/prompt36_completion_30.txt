  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse()` would not be called if the current URL string does not contain any illegal characters, but it would still be called if the base URL string contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse()` would not be called if the current URL string does not have a protocol (e.g., "http:" or "https:") but it would still be called if the base URL string does not have a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse()` would not be called if the current URL string does not have a pathname (e.g., "/path/to/file.html") but it would still be called if the base URL string does not have a pathname.

DONE.
