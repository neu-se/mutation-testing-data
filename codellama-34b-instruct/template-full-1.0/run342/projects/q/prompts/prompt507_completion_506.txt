  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is no longer being passed to the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is no longer being passed to the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string value is being passed to the `get` method, which is not a valid or useful argument.

DONE.
