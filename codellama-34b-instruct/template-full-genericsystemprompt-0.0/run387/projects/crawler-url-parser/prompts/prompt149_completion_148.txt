  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the `pageurl_path` string into an array of single characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings using the space character as the separator, and then returns the length of the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split(" ").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `pageurl_path`
