  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transformPosition` method to be used instead of the `transform` method, which would lead to a different result in the case of a number input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to be used instead of the `transformPosition` method, which would lead to a different result in the case of a number input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg < NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transformPosition` method to be used instead of the `transform` method, which would lead to a different result in the case of a number input.

DONE.
