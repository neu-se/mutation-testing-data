  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether the iteration has more elements, whereas `peekLength()` returns the length of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is a list of objects representing the operations in the iterated delta, whereas `peekLength()` returns the length of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops[otherIter.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is a list of objects representing the operations in the iterated delta, and `index` is the index of the current operation, whereas `peekLength()` returns the length of the current element.

DONE.
