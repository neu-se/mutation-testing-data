  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `transform` method instead of `invert`, which would lead to a different calculation of the attribute map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.inverted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new attribute map instead of inverting the existing one, which would lead to a different set of attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the attribute map entirely, which would lead to a different set of attributes.

DONE.
