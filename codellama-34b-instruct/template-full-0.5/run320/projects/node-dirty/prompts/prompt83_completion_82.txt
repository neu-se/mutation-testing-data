  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.includes` checks for the presence of a substring within a string, whereas `chunk.lastIndexOf` returns the last index of a substring within a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.replace` replaces a substring within a string, whereas `chunk.lastIndexOf` returns the last index of a substring within a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `chunk.split` splits a string into an array of substrings, whereas `chunk.lastIndexOf` returns the last index of a substring within a string.

DONE.
