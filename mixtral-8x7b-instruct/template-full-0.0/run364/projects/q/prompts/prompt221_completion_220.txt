 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of a new object with the prototype of `Promise.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `deferred` variable to `null`, causing errors in subsequent uses of `deferred`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function, which is not an object with the prototype of `Promise.prototype`.

DONE.
