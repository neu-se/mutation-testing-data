  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(function (result) {
    return result;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not present in the original code, and it would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the `nfapply` method, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).fail(function (error) {
    throw error;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not present in the original code, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error from the `nfapply` method, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).finally(function () {
    return null;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
