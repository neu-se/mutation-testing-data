  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to execute a different block of code when the `otherIter` iterator peeks a delete operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `retDelta` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to execute a different block of code when the `thisIter` iterator peeks an insert operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `retDelta` variable.
