  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is a logical NOT operator, which would negate the value of `end`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end + 1` would add 1 to the value of `end`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end - 1` would subtract 1 from the value of `end`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should be `false`.

DONE.
