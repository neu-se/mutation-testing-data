  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `pull` function call, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the fourth argument from the `pull` function call, which is present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments in the `pull` function call.

DONE.
