Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan(b)` computes the arctangent of `b` alone, ignoring the value of `a`, which can lead to incorrect angle calculations for complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(a, b)` switches the order of the arguments, which changes the quadrant determination of the angle, potentially leading to incorrect results for the complex logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b) + Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `Math.PI / 2` to the result of `Math.atan(b)` shifts the angle by 90 degrees, which is incorrect for the logarithm of a complex number and would yield erroneous results.

DONE.
