  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator to split the string, while the replaced code uses the `\` operator, which would produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator to split the string, while the replaced code uses the `\\` operator, which would produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` operator to split the string, while the replaced code uses the `//` operator, which would produce different results.

DONE.
