  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length` positions, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by the length of the `otherOp` object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.length - length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by the length of the `otherOp` object minus `length`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
