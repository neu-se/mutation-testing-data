  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument from the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all arguments except the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments.

DONE.
