  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `const` keyword would cause the variable `key` to be redeclared on each iteration of the loop, which would not be the case with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` keyword would allow the variable `key` to be reassigned on each iteration of the loop, which would not be the case with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `key` would be redeclared on each iteration of the loop, which would not be the case with the original code.

DONE.
