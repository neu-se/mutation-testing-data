Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would incorrectly evaluate any non-promise object as fulfilled, leading to false positives when checking if an object is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `undefined` as a fulfilled value, which could cause unexpected results when checking the fulfillment state of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for any object, as the string "fulfilled" does not represent a promise, thus incorrectly indicating that any object is fulfilled.

DONE.
