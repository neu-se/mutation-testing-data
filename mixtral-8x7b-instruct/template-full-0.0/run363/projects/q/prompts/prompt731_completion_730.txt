 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original object with `index` and `value` properties is replaced by just the `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original object with `index` and `value` properties is replaced by `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: 'mutated' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `value` property containing the progress is replaced by a string `'mutated'`.

DONE.
