  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a reference to the current object, and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`.

DONE.
