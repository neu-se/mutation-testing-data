 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would always return 0, regardless of the input points. This is because the method calculates the bearing based on the input points' latitudes and longitudes, and using a fixed point with 0 latitude and 0 longitude would not provide accurate results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would throw a `TypeError` when called with `null` as the first argument. This is because the method expects a `GeoPoint` object as its first argument, and using `null` instead would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ latitude: 0, longitude: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method
