  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with `null` as the argument, which would cause the stream to be destroyed immediately, rather than waiting for the data to be flushed. This could result in data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a new `Error` object as the argument, which would cause the stream to be destroyed with an error. This could result in the stream being closed with an error, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(this._writeStream));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
