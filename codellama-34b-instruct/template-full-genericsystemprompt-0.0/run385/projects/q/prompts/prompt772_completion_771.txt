  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `promises` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the `promises` array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first promise in the `promises` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all but the first promise in the `promises` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the entire array.

DONE.
