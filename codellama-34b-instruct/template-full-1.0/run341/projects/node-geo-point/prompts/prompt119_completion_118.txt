  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 would result in a value greater than 360, which is outside the range of the `calculateDestination` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(θ) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function converts degrees to radians, but subtracting 360 would result in a value less than 0, which is outside the range of the `calculateDestination` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 100 to the output of the `rad2deg` function would result in a value greater than 360, which is outside the range of the `calcul
