  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the `val` property instead of the `key` property, which could cause the code to access the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the `key` property plus one, which could cause the code to access the wrong data or produce an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the uppercase version of the `key` property, which could cause the code to access the wrong data or produce an error.

DONE.
