  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl` variable is an object, and `pageurl[0]` would reference the first property of the object, which may not exist or have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl["hostname"];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hostname` property of the `pageurl` object may not exist or have a different value than the original `pageurl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` property of the `pageurl` object may not exist or have a different value than the original `pageurl` object.

DONE.
