 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b'
```
This would result in different behavior because it misses the `s` character at the end of the regex pattern, which is present in the original code. This change would cause the regex to match singular nouns without the `s` suffix, resulting in incorrect pluralization for those words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + 's\\b' + ',i)'
