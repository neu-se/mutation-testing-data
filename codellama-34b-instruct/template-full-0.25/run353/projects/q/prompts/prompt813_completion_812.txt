  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but the `value` variable is not passed as an argument to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but the `value` variable is not passed as an argument to the callback function.

DONE.
