  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is empty.

DONE.
