  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'XX'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is not empty, which would affect the `URL.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is not empty, which would affect the `regexp.test()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'XXXXXX'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is not empty, which would affect the `regexp.replace()` method.

DONE.
