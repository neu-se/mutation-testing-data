 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function is redefined, causing the `continuer` function to always call the `callback` instead of handling exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` variable would be reassigned to the `callback` function, causing errors to be treated as normal fulfillment values instead of being handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a strict mode directive in the middle of the `continuer` function could potentially cause issues with variable scoping and invocation, leading to unexpected behavior in the error handling.

DONE.
