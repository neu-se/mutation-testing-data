  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `Q.invoke` function, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[args]` is an array containing the `args` array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(args)` creates a new promise that resolves with the value of `args`, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
