  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the beginning of the ops array instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the beginning of the ops array instead of the end, and it would remove any existing ops at the beginning of the array to make room for the new op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove an op from the end of the ops array instead of inserting a new op.

DONE.
