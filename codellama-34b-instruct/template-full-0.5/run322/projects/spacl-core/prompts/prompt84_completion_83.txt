  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value obtained by reducing the array to a single value using the provided function, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.find
```
This would result in different behavior because `find` returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

DONE.
