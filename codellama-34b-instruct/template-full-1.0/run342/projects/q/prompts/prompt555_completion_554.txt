  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback.dispatch` would be a function, while `errback` alone would be a function call, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Send(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Send` is a different function with a different implementation, potentially leading to different execution paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object).then(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` would create a new promise that would be fulfilled with the value of `object`, while `op` and `args` would be used as success and failure handlers, potentially leading to different execution paths.

DONE.
