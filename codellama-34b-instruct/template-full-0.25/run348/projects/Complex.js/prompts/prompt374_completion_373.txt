  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, while `2 * a` multiplies the real part by 2. This would cause the `cosh` and `sinh` functions to return different values, leading to incorrect results in the `tanh` and `coth` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, while `2 * (a + b)` multiplies the sum of the real and imaginary parts by 2. This would cause the `cosh` and `sinh` functions to return different values, leading to incorrect results in the `tanh` and `coth` functions.
