  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` variable is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` variable is not null, and the code would not execute the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` variable is not true, and the code would not execute the `if` statement.

DONE.
