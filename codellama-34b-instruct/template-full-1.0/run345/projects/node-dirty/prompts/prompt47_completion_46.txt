  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `cb` to be a function that can be called, but replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `cb` to be a function that can be called, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `cb` to be a function that can be called, but replacing it with an empty function would cause the `setImmediate` function to be called with an empty function as its first argument, which would not have the same behavior as calling `cb` with `undefined`.

DONE.
