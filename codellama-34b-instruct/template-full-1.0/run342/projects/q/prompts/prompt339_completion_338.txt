  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(x).state;
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that returns a promise, and without the `()` at the end, it would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect().state;
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that takes a parameter, and without the parameter, it would not call the proper `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect(x)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that returns a promise, and calling it with `x` as the parameter would not call the proper `inspect` method.

DONE.
