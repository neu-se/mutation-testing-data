 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the internal `_data` Map directly, bypassing any caching or synchronization mechanisms present in the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds `this` to `null`, which would cause issues when accessing the `_data` property in the `get` method, as `this` would not refer to the correct instance of the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get || function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `get` method with a no-op function if `this.get` is falsy, which could cause issues if the `update` method expects the `get` method to return a value.

DONE.
