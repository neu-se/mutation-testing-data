  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This change will cause the iterator to skip over the current element and move to the next one, which may result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This change will cause the iterator to move backward one element and then move forward again, which may also result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This change will cause the iterator to move forward twice as many elements as it would have originally, which may also result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
