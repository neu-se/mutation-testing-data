  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Dummy error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an error object, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'dummy value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a non-null value, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with a non-null value, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
