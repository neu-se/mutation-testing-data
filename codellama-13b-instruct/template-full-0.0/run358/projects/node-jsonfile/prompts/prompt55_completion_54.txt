  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would now accept an additional argument `EOL` that would be used to replace the newline characters in the output string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, finalEOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would now accept an additional argument `finalEOL` that would be used to determine whether the output string should end with a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, EOL, finalEOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would now accept an additional argument `EOL` that would be used to replace the newline characters in the output string, and an additional argument `finalEOL` that would be used to determine whether the output string should end with a newline character.

DONE.
