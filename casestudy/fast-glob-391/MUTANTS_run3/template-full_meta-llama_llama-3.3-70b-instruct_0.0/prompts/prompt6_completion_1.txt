Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
positive
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the positive patterns for the negative regular expressions, potentially allowing files that should be excluded to pass through the filter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an empty array of negative patterns, effectively disabling the negative filtering and allowing all files to pass through the filter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._settings.excludedPatterns
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the excluded patterns from the settings instead of the provided negative patterns, potentially changing the set of files that are excluded from the filter.

DONE.
