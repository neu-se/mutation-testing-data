  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the index was less than the length of the array, and if it was, it would return the basis. However, if the index is 0, it would return the basis, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
