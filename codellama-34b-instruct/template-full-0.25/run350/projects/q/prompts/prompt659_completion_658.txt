  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, which could lead to unexpected results in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
