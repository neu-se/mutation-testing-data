  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with `false`, while this new code fragment checks for inequality with `false`. This means that if `res` is not `false`, the new code fragment will return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with `false`, while this new code fragment checks for equality with `true`. This means that if `res` is `true`, the new code fragment will return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.
