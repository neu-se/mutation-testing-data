  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a static method call, while the modified code fragment is an instance method call. This could potentially cause different behavior if the `calculateDestination` method has different implementations for static and instance calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing + 180);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the destination point based on the given bearing, while the modified code fragment calculates the destination point based on the bearing plus 180 degrees. This could potentially cause different behavior if the bearing is used to determine the direction of movement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance + 1000, bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates
