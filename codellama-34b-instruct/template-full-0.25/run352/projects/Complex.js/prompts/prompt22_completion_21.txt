  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the new code fragment uses the difference of squares formula.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, while the new code fragment uses the difference of products formula.

DONE.
