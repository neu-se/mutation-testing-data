  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would be reduced to zero, causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would be reduced to its imaginary part, causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would be squared, causing the function to return a different value.

DONE.
