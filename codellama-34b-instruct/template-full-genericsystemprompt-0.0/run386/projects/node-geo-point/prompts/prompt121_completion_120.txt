  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
