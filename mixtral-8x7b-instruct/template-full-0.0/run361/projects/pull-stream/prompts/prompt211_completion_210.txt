 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data to the callback instead of the abort flag, potentially causing incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior in the caller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of the abort flag, potentially causing incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior in the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Mutation testing error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new error object instead of the abort flag, potentially causing incorrect error handling or unexpected behavior in the caller.

By introducing these changes, the test suite can identify potential weaknesses in the test coverage and help developers improve the test suite to handle these edge cases. DONE.
