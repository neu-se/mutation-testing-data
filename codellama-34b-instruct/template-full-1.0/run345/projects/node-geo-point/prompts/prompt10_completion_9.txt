  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first element of the coordinates array is undefined, which is not what the original code is doing. The original code is checking if the coordinates property is defined on the point object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the coordinates array has a length that is not equal to 2, which is not what the original code is doing. The original code is checking if the coordinates array has a length that is equal to 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1] !== point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second element of the coordinates array is not equal to the first element, which is not what the original code is doing. The original code is checking if the coordinates array has a length
