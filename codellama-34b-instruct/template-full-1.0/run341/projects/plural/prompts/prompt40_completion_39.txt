  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/auspices|ices/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, even though it matches the word "appendix" and "index". The original code fragment would replace "appendix" with "appendixes" and "index" with "indices". However, the new code fragment would replace "appendix" with "appendices" and "index" with "indices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'isces' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different, even though it contains the same number of characters as the original code fragment. The original code fragment would replace "appendix" with "appendixes" and "index" with "indices". However, the new code fragment would replace "appendix" with "appendixisces" and
