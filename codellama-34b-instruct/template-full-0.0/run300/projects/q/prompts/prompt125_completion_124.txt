  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether the property exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key) && this[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the property exists and is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key) && this[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the property exists and is not `null`.

DONE.
