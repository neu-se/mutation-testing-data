  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the peekLength method on the this iterator instead of accessing the peekLength property, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the minimum of the lengths of the two iterators instead of the length of the this iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the diffing algorithm.

DONE.
