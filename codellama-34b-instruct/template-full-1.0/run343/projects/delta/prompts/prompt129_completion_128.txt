  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next position, potentially skipping over other important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward, potentially revisiting operations that were already processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to peek at the next operation without advancing, potentially leading to infinite loops.

DONE.
