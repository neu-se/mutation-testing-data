  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that ends the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that ends the stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that corks the stream, whereas `end()` is a method that ends the stream.

DONE.
