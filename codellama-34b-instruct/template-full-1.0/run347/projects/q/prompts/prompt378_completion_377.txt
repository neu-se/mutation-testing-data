  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(promise).tap
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `Q(promise).tap` calls the `tap` method on the `promise` object, while the new code fragment calls the `tap` method on a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(promise).tap
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `Q(promise).tap` calls the `tap` method on the `promise` object, while the new code fragment calls the `tap` method on a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all([promise]).tap
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `Q(promise).tap` calls the `tap` method on the `promise` object, while the new code fragment calls the `tap` method on a promise returned by the
