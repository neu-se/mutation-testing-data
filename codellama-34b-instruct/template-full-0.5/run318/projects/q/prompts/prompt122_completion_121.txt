  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties of the `object` and would immediately return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties of the `object` and would immediately return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the properties of the empty object, resulting in an array of keys that are not present in the original `object`.

DONE.
