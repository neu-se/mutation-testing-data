  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with the `noop` function as the second and third arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, function() { throw new Error("Test error"); }, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with a function that throws an error as the second argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with a function that throws an error as the third argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the
