  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, since `data + 1` is not the same as `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, since `data - 1` is not the same as `data`.

DONE.
