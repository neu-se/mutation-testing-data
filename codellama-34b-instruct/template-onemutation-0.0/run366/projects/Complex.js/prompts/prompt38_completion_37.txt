  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both `_a` and `_b` to be less than 3000, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one of the two conditions to be true. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
