Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL string instead of the current URL string, potentially leading to incorrect parsing and resolution of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the current URL string, which would change the URL being parsed and could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the current URL string to uppercase, which may affect the parsing of the URL, especially in cases where the protocol or host is case-sensitive.

DONE.
