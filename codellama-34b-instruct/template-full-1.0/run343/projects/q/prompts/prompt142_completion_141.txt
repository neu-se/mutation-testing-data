  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the truthiness of `p.source`, while the new code fragment only assigns the value of `p.source` to `p`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `p` variable to iterate through the promise sources, while the new code fragment uses the `promise` variable directly to access the `source` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the truthiness of `p.source`, while the new code fragment checks the negation of the truthiness of `p.source`.

DONE.
