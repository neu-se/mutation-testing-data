  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while this replacement is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while this replacement is a property access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while this replacement is a method call.

DONE.
