  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a TypeError when called, whereas `flush` is a function and would not cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is an object and would be treated as a function when called, whereas `flush` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, whereas `flush` is a function that flushes a queue of tasks.

DONE.
