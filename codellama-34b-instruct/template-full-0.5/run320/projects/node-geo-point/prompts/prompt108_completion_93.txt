  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `zoom` and affect the calculation of `x` and `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of `zoom` and affect the calculation of `x` and `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `zoom` and affect the calculation of `x` and `y`.

DONE.
