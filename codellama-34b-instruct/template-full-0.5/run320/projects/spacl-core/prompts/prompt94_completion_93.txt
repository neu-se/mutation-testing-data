  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `policy.name` to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `policy.name` to uppercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the `policy.name`, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
