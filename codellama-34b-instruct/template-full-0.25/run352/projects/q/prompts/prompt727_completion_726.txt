  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed even if there are still pending promises, which would result in a premature resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when all promises have been resolved, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when all promises have been resolved and there are still promises to be resolved, which would result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
