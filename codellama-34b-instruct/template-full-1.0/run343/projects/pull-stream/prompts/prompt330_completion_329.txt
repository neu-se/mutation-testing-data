  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the data value, which could potentially change the output of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the data value by 2, which could potentially change the output of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data value is truthy, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
