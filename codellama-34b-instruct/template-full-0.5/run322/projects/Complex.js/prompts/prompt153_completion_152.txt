  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `z` is infinite, while this code also checks if `z` is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite or zero, while this code checks if `z` is both infinite and zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite or zero, while this code checks if `z` is either infinite or zero.

DONE.
