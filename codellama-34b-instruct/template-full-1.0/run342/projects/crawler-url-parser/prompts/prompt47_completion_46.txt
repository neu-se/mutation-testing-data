  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the port number from the URL, which could cause the code to behave differently when encountering a URL with a non-standard port number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove the port number from the URL, which could cause the code to behave differently when encountering a URL with a non-standard port number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove the query string from the URL, which could cause the code to behave differently when encountering a URL with a query string.

DONE.
