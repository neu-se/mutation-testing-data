  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.eval, deferred.finally, deferred.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because eval, finally, and cancel are not the same as resolve, reject, and notify.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, Promise.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promises API uses the resolve, reject, and notify semantics, but it would still be different from the original code because it would be using the Promises API.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve, Q.reject, Q.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would still be using the Q library's Promise implementation.

DONE.
