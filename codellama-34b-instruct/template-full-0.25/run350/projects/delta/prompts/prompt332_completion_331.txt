  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the baseOp, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the baseOp, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the baseOp, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
