  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 0 and ends with a slash. This means that the new code fragment would allow strings with a length of 1 to pass, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 || string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 and ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the string has a length greater than 1 or ends with a slash. This means that the new code fragment would allow strings with a length of 1 to pass, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
