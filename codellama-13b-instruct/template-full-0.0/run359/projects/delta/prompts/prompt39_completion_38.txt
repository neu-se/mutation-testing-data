  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` function would now return `b` if `a[key] !== undefined`, which means that the attribute would be overwritten with the value from `b`, regardless of the value of `priority`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` function would now return `b` if `a[key] === null`, which means that the attribute would be overwritten with the value from `b` only if the attribute in `a` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` function would now return `b` if `a[key] !== b[key]`, which means that the attribute would be overwritten with the value from `b` only if the attribute in `a`
