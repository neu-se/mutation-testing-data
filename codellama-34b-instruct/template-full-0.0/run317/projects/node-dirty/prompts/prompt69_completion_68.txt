  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, instead of the actual number of loaded keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value that is one more than the actual number of loaded keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value that is one less than the actual number of loaded keys.

DONE.
