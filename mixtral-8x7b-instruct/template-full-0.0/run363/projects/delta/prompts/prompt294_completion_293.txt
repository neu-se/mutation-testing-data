 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the next character after the newline, instead of the newline character itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it moves the iterator to the previous operation, instead of moving to the next insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.skip(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the next `index` characters, instead of moving to the next insert operation with the specified length.

DONE.
