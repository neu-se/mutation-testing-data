  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify(obj, options)` will throw a `TypeError` when `obj` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify(obj, options)` will throw a `TypeError` when `obj` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify({}, options)` will return an empty string, and `stripBom(data)` will return the original string.

DONE.
