  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = a > 1 && b === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while this code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = a === 0 && b === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while this code fragment checks if both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = a === 0 && b !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while this code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is zero and the imaginary part is non-zero.

DONE.
