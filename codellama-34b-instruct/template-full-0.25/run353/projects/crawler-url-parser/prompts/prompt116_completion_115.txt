  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called on the `urlMap` object with a key that does not exist in the map, which would not have any effect on the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is called on the `urlMap` object with a key that already exists in the map, which would overwrite the existing value with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is called on the `urlMap` object, which would remove all key-value pairs from the map.

DONE.
