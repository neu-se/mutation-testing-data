  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length` steps, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length - 1` steps, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by `length + 1` steps, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
