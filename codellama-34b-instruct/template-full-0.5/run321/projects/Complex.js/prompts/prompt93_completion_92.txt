  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation would always result in a truthy value, causing the `parser_exit()` function to be called, even if the input string is a valid complex number representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function would always return `false`, causing the `parser_exit()` function to never be called, even if the input string is not a valid complex number representation.
