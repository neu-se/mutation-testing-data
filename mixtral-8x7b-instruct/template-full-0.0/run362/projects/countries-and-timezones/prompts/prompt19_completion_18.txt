 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property of the returned object would be an array containing strings instead of arrays of timezone IDs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property of the returned object would be `null` for countries with timezones, instead of an array of timezone IDs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property of the returned object would contain random numbers instead of arrays of timezone IDs.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process can help identify potential weaknesses in the test suite for this code. DONE.
