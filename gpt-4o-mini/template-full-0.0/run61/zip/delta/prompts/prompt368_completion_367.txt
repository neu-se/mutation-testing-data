Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to compare the type of the current operation in `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when handling operations from the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `next()` on `otherIter`, advancing the iterator and potentially skipping the current operation, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations in the transformation process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the comparison to always check for a 'delete' operation, ignoring the actual type of the operation in `otherIter`, which could lead to incorrect logic in the transformation process.

DONE.
