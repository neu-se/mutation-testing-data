  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an exception if the `rejected` callback is not a function, while this new code fragment would throw an exception regardless of whether the `rejected` callback is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a rejected promise if the `rejected` callback is not a function, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise regardless of whether the `rejected` callback is a function or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the `rejected` callback is not a function, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise regardless of whether the `rejected` callback is a function or not.

DONE.
