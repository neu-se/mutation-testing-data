Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
var prop = require('./prop')

function id (e) { return e }

module.exports = function tester (test) {
  return (
    'object' === typeof test && 'function' === typeof test.test //regexp
    ? function (data) { return test.test(<PLACEHOLDER>) }
    : prop (test) || id
  )
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
data
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
