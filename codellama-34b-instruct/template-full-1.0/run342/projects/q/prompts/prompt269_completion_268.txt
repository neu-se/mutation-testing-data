  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(new Error(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior as the reason passed to the `reject` function would be wrapped in an `Error` object and would be handled differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(resolve(neighbor(reason)));
```
This would result in different behavior as the reason passed to the `reject` function would be replaced with the resolved value of `neighbor(reason)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason, reason));
```
This would result in different behavior as the reason passed to the `reject` function would be treated as a value to be fulfilled.

DONE.
