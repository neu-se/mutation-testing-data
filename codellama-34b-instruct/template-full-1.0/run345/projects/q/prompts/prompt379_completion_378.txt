  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is expected to be a function, but `1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, but `callback` is expected to be one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function always returns `0`, while the original `callback` function may return different values depending on its implementation.

DONE.
