  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `linkurl` argument, but without the `baseUrlStr` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, pageurl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `linkurl` argument, but with the `pageurl` argument instead of the `baseUrlStr` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:/, ""));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `linkurl` argument, but with a modified `baseUrlStr` argument that has had the scheme (e.g. "https:") removed, which could cause the function to
