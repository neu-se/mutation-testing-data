  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned a value to `z['im']`, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned a value to `z['im']` based on the value of `a['im']`, while the new code fragment assigns a value of `a['im']` to `z['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = b['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigned a value to `z['im']` based on the value of `b['im']`, while the new code fragment assigns a value of `b['im']` to `z['im']`.

DONE.
