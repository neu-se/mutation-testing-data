  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.startsWith
```
This change will cause the `Matcher` class to produce a different result for certain inputs, as it will now match the beginning of the input string instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes
```
This change will cause the `Matcher` class to produce a different result for certain inputs, as it will now match any part of the input string instead of just the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.indexOf
```
This change will cause the `Matcher` class to produce a different result for certain inputs, as it will now match the index of the first occurrence of the input string instead of just the end.

DONE.
