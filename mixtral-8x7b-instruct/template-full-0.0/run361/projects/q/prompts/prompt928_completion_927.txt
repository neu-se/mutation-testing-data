 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `arguments` object directly. This could lead to issues if the code relies on the mutability or identity of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments).map(function(key) { return arguments[key]; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by extracting the values from the `arguments` object using `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.map()`. This could lead to issues if the code relies on the order of the arguments or if the arguments have non-integer keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call(Array.prototype.slice, arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it
