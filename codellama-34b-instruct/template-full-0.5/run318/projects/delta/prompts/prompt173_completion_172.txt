  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` call to be skipped, potentially resulting in a different number of operations being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` call to return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the next operation, potentially resulting in the wrong operation being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` call to return a value that is one less than the actual length of the next operation, potentially resulting in the wrong operation being processed.

DONE.
