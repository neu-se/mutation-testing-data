  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a `then` method, which would cause the function to return a promise instead of the generator object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a `catch` method, which would cause the function to return a promise instead of the generator object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a `finally` method, which would cause the function to return a promise instead of the generator object.

DONE.
