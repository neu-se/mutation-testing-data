  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is NaN, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is finite, while `!isInfinite` checks if the value is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to infinity, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

DONE.
