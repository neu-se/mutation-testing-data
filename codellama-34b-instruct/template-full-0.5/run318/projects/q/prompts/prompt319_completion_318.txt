  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the original method with a new function that does nothing, causing the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () { throw new Error("Test error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, instead of being resolved or rejected according to the original method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () { return Q.reject("Test rejection"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new rejection reason, instead of being resolved or rejected according to the original method.

DONE.
