 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current promise object instead of the `nodeArgs` array, causing the `fapply` method to be called with an incorrect argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the `fapply` method, which would not include the `nodeArgs` array or the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, causing incorrect behavior or errors in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `nodeArgs` and the resolver function directly, instead of creating a new array with `nodeArgs` and the resolver function as its last element. This could cause issues if any subsequent code relies on the structure of the arguments passed to `fapply`.
