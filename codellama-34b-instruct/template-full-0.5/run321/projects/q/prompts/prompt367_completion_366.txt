  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Injected error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because null would be thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined would be thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
