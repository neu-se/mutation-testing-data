  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted instead of the `drain` event, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 'foo'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted with a different argument, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
