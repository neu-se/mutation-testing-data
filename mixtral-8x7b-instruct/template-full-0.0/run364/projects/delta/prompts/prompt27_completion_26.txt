 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<any>attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `<any>` type assertion, which bypasses TypeScript's type checking and allows for potential runtime errors. The original code uses `<PLACEHOLDER>` which refers to `attributes`, but the type assertion is unnecessary and may hide issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(attributes))).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(attributes))` to clone the object, which may not preserve certain data types like `Date`, `RegExp`, or custom objects. The original code uses `cloneDeep` from lodash, which provides a deep cloning mechanism that preserves the original data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(Object.assign({}, attributes
