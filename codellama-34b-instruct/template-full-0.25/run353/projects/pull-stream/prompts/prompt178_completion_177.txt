  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with the correct arguments, but the new code fragment is calling it with the incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
