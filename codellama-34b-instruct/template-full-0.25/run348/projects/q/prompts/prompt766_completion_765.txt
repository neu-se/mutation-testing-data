  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not throw an error, whereas this replacement code fragment throws an error with a message that includes the rejection message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not reject the promise, whereas this replacement code fragment rejects the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not resolve the promise, whereas this replacement code fragment resolves the promise with the rejection reason.

DONE.
