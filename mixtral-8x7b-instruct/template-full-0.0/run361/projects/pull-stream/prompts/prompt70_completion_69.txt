 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition checks for `true` instead of `false`, effectively reversing the logic of the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'use strict'; op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `'use strict'` directive would cause a syntax error when this code is executed in strict mode.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === !!op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!!` operator is used to convert the result of `op(data)` to a boolean, which would always return `true` or `false`. This could potentially mask the original bug where the `op` function returns a non-boolean value.

DONE.
