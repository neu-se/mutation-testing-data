  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the addition of an unnecessary `s` at the end of the word, which is already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original word with an additional `s` at the end, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'[0] + 'ea'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different word altogether, with the first letter of the original word followed by `ea`.

DONE.
