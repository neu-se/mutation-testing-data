  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different ranges and properties. In this case, using `sin` instead of `cos` would cause the bearing calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different ranges and properties. In this case, using `tan` instead of `cos` would cause the bearing calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different ranges and properties. In this case, using `acos` instead of `cos` would cause the bearing calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
