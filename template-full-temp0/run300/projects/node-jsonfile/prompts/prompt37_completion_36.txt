  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but it is being used in the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but it is being used in the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.mode
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property is not being used in the original code fragment, but it is being used in the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions.

DONE.
