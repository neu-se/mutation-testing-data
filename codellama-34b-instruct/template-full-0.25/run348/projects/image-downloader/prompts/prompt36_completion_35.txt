  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to instead of overwritten. This could cause the file to grow indefinitely, which could lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten. This could cause data loss if the file is not properly closed before the new data is written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'wx' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'wx'`, which means that the file will be created if it does not exist, and the write will fail if the
