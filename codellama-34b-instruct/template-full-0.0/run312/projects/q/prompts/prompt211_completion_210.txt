  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `apply` method as the `this` value for the callback function, instead of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `apply` method as the `this` value for the callback function, instead of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument of the `apply` method as the `this` value for the callback function, instead of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
