  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!abort` condition would be evaluated as `true` even if `abort` is `true`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true`, even if the `op` function returned `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!op` condition would be evaluated as `true` even if `op` is `true`, which would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true`, even if the `op` function returned `false`.
