Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'r' property instead of 'phi', which may lead to incorrect calculations of the imaginary part of the complex number, as 'r' typically represents the magnitude rather than the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the angle 'phi' with a constant value (Ï€), which would yield a fixed imaginary part regardless of the input, thus not accurately representing the intended complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the angle by adding 1 to 'arg', which would distort the calculation of the imaginary part, leading to incorrect results for the complex number representation.

DONE.
