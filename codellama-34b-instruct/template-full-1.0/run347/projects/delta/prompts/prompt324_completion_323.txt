  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator will produce a different result than the addition operator, even if the two operands are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be adding one more to the result of the addition operator, which would change the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + (length << 1) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would be adding 2 times the length to the result of the addition operator, which would change the output.

DONE.
