  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is changed, which could potentially match different URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the string is converted to lowercase before testing it against the regular expression pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\
