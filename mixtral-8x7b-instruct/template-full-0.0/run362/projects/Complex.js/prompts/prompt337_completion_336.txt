 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `b === 0` would always be false, causing the function to return a complex number with the arctangent of 1, rather than the original code which returns a complex number with the arctangent of the input's imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `b === 0` would always be true, causing the function to return a complex number with the arctangent of 0, rather than the original code which returns a complex number with the arctangent of the input's imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `b === 0` would always be false, causing the function to return a complex number with the arctangent of the absolute value of the input'
