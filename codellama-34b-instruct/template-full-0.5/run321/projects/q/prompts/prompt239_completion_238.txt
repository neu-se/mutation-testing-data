  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a property of the `resolvedPromise` object, and it is a promise that resolves to the value of `resolvedPromise`. By replacing `resolvedPromise` with `resolvedPromise.promise`, the code would be resolving the promise to a promise, which would result in a different behavior.

By replacing `resolvedPromise` with `resolvedPromise.value`, the code would be resolving the promise to a value, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ful
