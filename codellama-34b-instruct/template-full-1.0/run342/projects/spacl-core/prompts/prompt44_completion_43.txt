  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)' + seg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/([^/]+)` captures the part of the string that matches the pattern, but the original code fragment does not capture the segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(seg + '/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `([^/]+)` captures the part of the string that matches the pattern, but the original code fragment does not capture the segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)' + seg + '/([^/]+)')

DONE.
