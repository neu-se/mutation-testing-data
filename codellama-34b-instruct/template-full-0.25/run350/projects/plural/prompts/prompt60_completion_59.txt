```
'criterias'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is correct and returns the plural form of the word "criteria" as "criterias", while the new code fragment returns the incorrect plural form "criterias" for the word "criteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is correct and returns the plural form of the word "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment returns the incorrect plural form "criterion" for the word "criteria".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is correct and returns the plural form of the word "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment returns the incorrect plural form "criterions" for the word "criteria".
