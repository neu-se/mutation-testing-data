  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called as a method of the object `Q(object)`, whereas `fail` is a method of the `Q` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)['dispatch']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is accessed as a property of the object `Q(object)`, rather than being called as a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called as a method of a deferred object created by the `Q.defer()` method, rather than being called as a method of the object `Q(object)`.

DONE.
