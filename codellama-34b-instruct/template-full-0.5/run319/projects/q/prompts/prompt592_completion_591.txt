  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method expects an array of promises, but `[]` is an empty array, which would result in a promise that resolves with an empty array, rather than a promise that resolves with an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method expects an array of promises, but `[1]` is an array with a single value, which would result in a promise that resolves with an array of length 1, rather than a promise that resolves with an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` method expects an array of promises, but `[null]` is an array with a single null value, which would result in a promise that resolves with an array of length 1, rather than a promise that resolves with an array of values.
