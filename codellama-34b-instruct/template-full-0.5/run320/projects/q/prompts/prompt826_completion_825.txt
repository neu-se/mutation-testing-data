  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to `makeStackTraceLong`, which would cause an error when trying to access the `stack` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the second argument to `makeStackTraceLong`, which would cause an error when trying to access the `stack` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `makeStackTraceLong`, which would cause an error when trying to access the `stack` property of `null`.

DONE.
