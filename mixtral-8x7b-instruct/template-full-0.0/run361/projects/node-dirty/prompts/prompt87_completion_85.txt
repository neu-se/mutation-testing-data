 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the array instead of the last one, affecting the order of the rows loaded from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new shallow copy of the array, causing the original `arr` not to be modified and the `buffer` variable to remain unchanged, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely removes the code responsible for processing the rows, causing the database to fail loading any data from the file and potentially leading to data loss.

DONE.
