  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the at symbol (`@`) is used to indicate a telephone number in many cultures, while the pound symbol (`#`) is used in various contexts, including to denote a channel on IRC.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the exclamation mark (`!`) is used in various contexts, including to indicate excitement or emphasis, or as a separator in certain programming languages.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"?"
```
This would result in different behavior because the question mark (`?`) is used in various contexts, including to indicate a question or ask for information.

DONE.
