  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a different method than `thenReject`, and it would resolve the promise with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(reason).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason` is a different value than `promise`, and it would reject the promise with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(null, reason => reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a different method than `thenReject`, and it would return a new promise that resolves with the original value if the original promise is fulfilled, and rejects with a new reason if the original promise is rejected.

DONE.
