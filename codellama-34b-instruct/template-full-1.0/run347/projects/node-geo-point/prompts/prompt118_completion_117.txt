  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
70 + distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing using the distance traveled, while this modified code adds an additional distance of 70 to the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing using the distance traveled, while this modified code multiplies the distance traveled by 2, which would result in a different bearing being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing using the distance traveled, while this modified code calculates the bearing using the product of pi and the distance traveled, which would result in a different bearing being calculated.

DONE.
