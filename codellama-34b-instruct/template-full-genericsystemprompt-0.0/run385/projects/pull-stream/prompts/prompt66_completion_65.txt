  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return `null` instead of the expected `end` value when `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return `null` instead of the expected `end` value when `end` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? end : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to return `end` instead of `null` when `end` is `false`.

DONE.
