  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, so it would cause a `TypeError` if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, so it would cause a `TypeError` if called.

DONE.
