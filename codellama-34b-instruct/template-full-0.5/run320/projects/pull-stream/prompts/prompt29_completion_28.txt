  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is changed, which could cause the function to pull the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is changed, which could cause the function to pull the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is changed, which could cause the function to pull the wrong value.

DONE.
