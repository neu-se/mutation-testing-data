  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, but this replacement code fragment is only accessing the last element of the array using the `[0]` index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `for...of` loop to iterate over the array returned by `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`, but this replacement code fragment is only accessing the second-to-last element of the array using the `[1]` index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because
