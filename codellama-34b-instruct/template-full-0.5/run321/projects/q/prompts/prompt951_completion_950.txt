  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an array containing the value `1` would cause the function to receive a single argument with the value `1`, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an array
