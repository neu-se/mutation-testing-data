  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ1 + φ2) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points, while this replacement code is using a simplified formula that assumes the Earth is flat.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
180 - (φ1 + φ2) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points using the Haversine formula, while this replacement code calculates the distance between two points using a simple formula that assumes the Earth is a sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ1 - φ2) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points using the Haversine formula, while this replacement code calculates the distance between two points using a simple formula that assumes the Earth is a sphere and neglects the curvature of the Earth.
