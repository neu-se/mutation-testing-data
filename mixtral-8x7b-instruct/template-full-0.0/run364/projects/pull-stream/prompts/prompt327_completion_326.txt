 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would always be called with `true` as the `abort` argument, even when the stream is ending due to an error. The original code only calls `once` with `true` when the stream is explicitly aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would always be called with `null` as the `abort` argument, even when the stream is ending due to an error. The original code only calls `once` with `null` when the stream ends gracefully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with the `data` argument, which is not what the `abort` parameter is intended for. The original code calls `once` with the `end` argument, which indicates whether the stream has ended.
