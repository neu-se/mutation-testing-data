  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `null` is not an array and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `undefined` is not an array and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `[]` is an empty array and would cause the function to return an empty array, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
