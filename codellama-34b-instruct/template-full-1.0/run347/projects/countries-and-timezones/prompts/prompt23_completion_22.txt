  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffsetStr: `${Math.abs(utcOffset)}:${getNumStr(utcOffset % 60)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the offset is no longer included in the result, which could lead to errors in downstream calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffsetStr: `(${utcOffset})`
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset is surrounded by parentheses, which would change the way it is formatted in the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffsetStr: `${getNumStr(utcOffset)}:${getNumStr(utcOffset % 60)}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the minutes component of the offset is not correctly calculated. The modulo operator is used to calculate the minutes, but the result is not properly formatted.

DONE.
