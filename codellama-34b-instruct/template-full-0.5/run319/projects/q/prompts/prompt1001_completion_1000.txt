  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("send", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the "send" method instead of the "post" method, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the "post" method instead of the "send" method, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the "post" method and resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially return a different result.
