  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+@(.+):(\d+)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression uses the `^` character to match the beginning of a string, and the `$` character to match the end of a string. Removing these characters would cause the regular expression to match any string that contains a `@` character followed by a sequence of one or more digits, rather than a string that starts with a `@` character and ends with a sequence of one or more digits.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@/.+:(\d+)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression uses the `.` character to match any character except for a newline, and the `+` character to match one or more occurrences of the preceding character. Replacing these characters with the `.+` sequence would cause the regular expression to match any string that contains a `@` character followed by any sequence of one or more non-newline characters, rather than a string that starts with a `@` character
