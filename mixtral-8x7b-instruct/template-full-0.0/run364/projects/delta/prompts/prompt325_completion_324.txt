 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the `slice` method is changed, which would return a different slice of the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the starting and ending indices of the slice are changed, potentially including or excluding certain operations from the slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the starting index is now negative, which would cause an error when passing it to the `slice` method.

DONE.
