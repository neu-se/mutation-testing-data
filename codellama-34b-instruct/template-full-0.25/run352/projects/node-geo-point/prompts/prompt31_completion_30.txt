  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of `point1` instead of `point2`, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude value of `point2` instead of the longitude value, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude + point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude and longitude values of `point1` and `point2` instead of using the longitude value of `point2`, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
