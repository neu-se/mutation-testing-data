Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop by continuously calling `_flush` without any condition to stop, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prematurely close the write stream, preventing any further data from being written, which could lead to data loss or incomplete writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire queue of pending writes, potentially discarding data that was meant to be written, leading to inconsistencies in the database.

DONE.
