  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different slice of the `arguments` array, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
