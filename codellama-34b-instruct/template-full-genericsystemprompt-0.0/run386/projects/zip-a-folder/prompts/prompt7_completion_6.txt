  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `targetFilePath` string, which could cause the `access` method to fail if the path is not valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `targetFilePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the `access` method to fail if the path is not valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `targetFilePath` string on the `/` character and return the last element of the resulting array, which could cause the `access` method to fail if the path is not valid.

DONE.
