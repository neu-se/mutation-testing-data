  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `cb` is passed as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `abort` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `cb` is passed as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with `onAbort` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `cb` is passed as the first argument.
