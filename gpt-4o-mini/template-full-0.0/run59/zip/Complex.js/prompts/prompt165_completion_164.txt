Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of division by zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass when the number is not infinite, potentially allowing for division by zero to return `Complex['INFINITY']` incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, which does not account for the imaginary part and could lead to incorrect results when dividing by complex numbers that are not infinite but have a zero real part.

DONE.
