  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `\n` to match newlines, while the new code fragment uses `\r` to match carriage returns. This would cause the `replace` method to behave differently and potentially produce different results.
