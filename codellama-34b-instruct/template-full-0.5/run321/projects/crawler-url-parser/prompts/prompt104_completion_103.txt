  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified value, or -1 if it's not found. In contrast, `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, or null if no matches are found. In contrast, `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.split(text).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, and the length of the array is greater than 1 if the specified value is found in the string. In contrast, `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value
