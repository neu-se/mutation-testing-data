 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects exactly two arguments, a fulfillment handler and a rejection handler. By providing an empty function, the number of arguments passed to `then` is now three, causing different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `then` method would refer to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode, instead of the current promise. This would cause the rejection handler to not be invoked when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a number and not a function. The `then` method expects a function as its second argument, so passing a number would cause an error and change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
