 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data as the error instead of the actual error object, potentially causing the error handling code to not execute as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as the error, which might not be handled correctly by the error handling code, causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Artificial error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object, which might not be the same as the original error object, causing unexpected behavior in the error handling code.

DONE.
