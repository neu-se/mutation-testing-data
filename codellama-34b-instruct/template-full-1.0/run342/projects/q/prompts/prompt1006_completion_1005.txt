  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would fail with a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise that resolves to the result of the method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would fail with a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise that resolves to the result of the method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would fail with a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise that resolves to the result of the method call.

DONE.
