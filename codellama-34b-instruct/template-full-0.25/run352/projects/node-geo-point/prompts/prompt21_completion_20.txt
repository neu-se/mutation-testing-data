  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the properties, while this code checks for their values being undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of both properties, while this code checks for their values being equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude + object.longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of both properties, while this code checks for their sum being equal to 0.

DONE.
