Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the state of the promise as "rejected" instead of inspecting its actual state, leading to incorrect behavior when determining the nearest resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the value directly instead of inspecting the promise, which could lead to incorrect results if the value is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `null` for the inspected state, ignoring the actual state of the promise and potentially leading to incorrect handling of fulfilled or rejected promises.

DONE.
