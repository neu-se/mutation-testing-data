  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow images with the `.jpg` extension to be downloaded, while the original code fragment would allow images with any extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.png'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow images with the `.png` extension to be downloaded, while the original code fragment would allow images with any extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.gif'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow images with the `.gif` extension to be downloaded, while the original code fragment would allow images with any extension.

DONE.
