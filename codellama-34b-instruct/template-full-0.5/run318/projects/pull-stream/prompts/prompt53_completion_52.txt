  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `s` is an object, not if it's a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `s` is a function, not if it's an object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object && s.hasOwnProperty('sink')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is an object and has a `sink` property, not if it's a function or not.

DONE.
