  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would delay the execution of `dispatch` by one turn, which could impact the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method would catch any errors encountered by `dispatch`, which could potentially alter the control flow of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method would execute the callback function regardless of whether `dispatch` throws an error or not, which could impact the control flow of the program.

DONE.
