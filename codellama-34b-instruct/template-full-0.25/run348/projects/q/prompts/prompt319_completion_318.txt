  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to access the wrong property in the `descriptor` object, potentially leading to a `TypeError` or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment would modify the `descriptor` object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` would cause the code to call the `descriptor[op]` function, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
