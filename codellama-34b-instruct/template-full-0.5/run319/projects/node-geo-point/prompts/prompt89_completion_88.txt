  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `cos(φ2)` would be incorrect, as it should be `cos(Δλ)` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `sin(φ1)` would be incorrect, as it should be `cos(φ1)` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `sin(φ1)` would be incorrect, as it should be `cos(φ1)` instead.

DONE.
