  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `this` value set to `continuer`, which is not the intended behavior. The `bind` method is used to create a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it is being called on a function that is already bound to a specific `this` value, which could cause issues with the function's behavior.

DONE.
