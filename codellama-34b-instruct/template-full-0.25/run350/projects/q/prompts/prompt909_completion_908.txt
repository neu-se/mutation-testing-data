  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have a length of 1, while the replaced code fragment would have a length of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have a length of 1, while the replaced code fragment would have a length of 3.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `baseArgs` array to have a length of 1, while the replaced code fragment would have a length of 0.

DONE.
