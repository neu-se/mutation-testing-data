  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment only checks if `a` is greater than 0. This means that the new code fragment would not handle the case where `a` is equal to 0, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
