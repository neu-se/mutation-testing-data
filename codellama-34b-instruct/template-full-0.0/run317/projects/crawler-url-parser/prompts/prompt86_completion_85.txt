  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the text content of the anchor element, while this replacement retrieves the value of the href attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('title')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the text content of the anchor element, while this replacement retrieves the value of the title attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('alt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the text content of the anchor element, while this replacement retrieves the value of the alt attribute.

DONE.
