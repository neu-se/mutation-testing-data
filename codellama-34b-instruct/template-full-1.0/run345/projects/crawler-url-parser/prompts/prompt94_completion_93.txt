  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because a different operator is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```$(`<PLACEHOLDER>`).pointer()
```
This would result in different behavior because a different method is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```window.<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because a different object is used.

DONE.
