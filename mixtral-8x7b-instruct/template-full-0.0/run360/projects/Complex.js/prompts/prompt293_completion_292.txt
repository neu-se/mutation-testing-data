 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the global `Math.cosh` function instead of the `cosh` method from the Complex class. This could lead to incorrect results when working with complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use the `cosh` method from the current object, which is not defined. This would throw a `TypeError` and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `cosh` function with the number 0, which would lead to incorrect results when calculating the cotangent of a complex number.

DONE.
