  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings is reversed, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` parameter is missing, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` parameter is used instead of the `cursor` parameter, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

DONE.
