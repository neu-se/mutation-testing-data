  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which could cause it to return incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with an additional argument, which could cause it to return incorrect results or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be called with a different argument, which could cause it to return incorrect results or throw an error.

DONE.
