  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the promise was not fulfilled yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done != true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of `done`, even if the promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
