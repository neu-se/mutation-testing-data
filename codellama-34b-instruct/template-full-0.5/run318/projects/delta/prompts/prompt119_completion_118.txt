  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` would be `undefined` and the `if` condition would evaluate to `false`, causing the `else` block to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.delete` would be `undefined` and the `if` condition would evaluate to `false`, causing the `else` block to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain && elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain && elem.delete` would be `undefined` and the `if` condition would evaluate to `false`, causing the `else` block to be executed.

DONE.
