  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the property value to "get" instead of invoking the method with the given name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["get"](key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the "get" method instead of the "dispatch" method to invoke the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the property name instead of the method name to invoke the function.

DONE.
