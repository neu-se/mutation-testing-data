  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise returned by `dispatch` to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.someOtherMethod, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different method on the `deferred` object, which could have different behavior depending on the implementation of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
someOtherDeferred.resolve, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different deferred object to resolve the promise returned by `dispatch`, which could have different behavior depending on the implementation of the deferred object.

DONE.
