  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only considers inserting, but this code fragment would consider other cases as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only considers inserting and only if the peek length is smaller than firstLeft, but this code fragment would consider other cases and only if the peek length is bigger than firstLeft.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only considers inserting and only if the peek length is smaller than firstLeft, but this code fragment would consider other cases and only if the peek length is smaller than firstLeft + 1
