  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property, which could lead to a different calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different zoom level, which could lead to a different calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different zoom level, which could lead to a different calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
