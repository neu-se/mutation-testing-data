  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `options` is not a string, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `options` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === { encoding: options }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `options` is not an object with an `encoding` property, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `options` is an object with an `encoding` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `options.encoding` is not equal to `'utf8'`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `options.encoding` is equal to `'utf8'`.

DONE.
