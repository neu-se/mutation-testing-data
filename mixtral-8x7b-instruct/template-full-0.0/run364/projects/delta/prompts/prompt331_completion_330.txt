 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now only considers the inserted content of the baseOp, ignoring other properties such as attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() call would receive null as its second argument, which might cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
