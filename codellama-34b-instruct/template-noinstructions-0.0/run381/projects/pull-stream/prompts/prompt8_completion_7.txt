  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sources` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the code is expecting to work with `sinks`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throughs` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the code is expecting to work with `sinks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the code is expecting to work with `sinks`.

DONE.
