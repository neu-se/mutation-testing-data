  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the replaced code fragment is a call to that function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, nextChunk)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to a function with no arguments, while the replaced code fragment is a call to a function with a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = nextChunk
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to a function, while the replaced code fragment is an assignment of a function to a variable.

DONE.
