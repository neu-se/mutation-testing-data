  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` for any finite number, while `isNaN` returns `true` only for the `NaN` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` would return `true` for any value that is not `NaN`, while `isNaN` returns `true` only for `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a more strict version of `isNaN` that only returns `true` for the `NaN` value and not for other non-numeric values.

DONE.
