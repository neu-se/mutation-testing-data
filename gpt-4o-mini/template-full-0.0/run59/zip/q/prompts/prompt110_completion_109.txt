Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] != value
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality instead of equality, causing the function to return the index of the first element that does not match the value instead of the first element that does match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current element is `undefined`, which would lead to returning the index of the first `undefined` element in the array instead of the first occurrence of the specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks specifically for `null` values, meaning that the function would only return the index of the first `null` element in the array, ignoring all other values.

DONE.
