  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the iterator to skip over the first element in the array. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the first element in the array is important for the correctness of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with an argument of `Infinity`, which would cause the iterator to skip over all elements in the array. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the array is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with an argument of `NaN`, which would cause the iterator to skip over all elements in the array. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently
