  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the letter 'x' to the verb, which could potentially change the meaning of the query.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the verb to uppercase, which could potentially change the meaning of the query.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the letters in the verb, which could potentially change the meaning of the query.

DONE.
