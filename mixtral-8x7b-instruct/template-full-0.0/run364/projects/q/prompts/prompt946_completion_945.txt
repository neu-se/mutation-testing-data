 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy node resolver'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the successful resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise instead of waiting for the Node.js-style callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a promise that is already resolved with the same value as the original promise, instead of waiting for the Node.js-style callback to be called.

DONE.
