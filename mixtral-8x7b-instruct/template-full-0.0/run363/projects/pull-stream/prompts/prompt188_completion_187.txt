 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the same element instead of iterating through the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the array instead of iterating through it.

DONE.
