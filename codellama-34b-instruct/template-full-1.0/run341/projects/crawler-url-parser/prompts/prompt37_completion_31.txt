  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would cause the code to always use the current URL as the base URL, rather than using the domain of the current URL as the base URL as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would cause the code to use the `URL.parse` function with a `null` input, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation would cause the code to use a fixed base URL, which would not reflect the actual domain of the current URL as intended.

DONE.
