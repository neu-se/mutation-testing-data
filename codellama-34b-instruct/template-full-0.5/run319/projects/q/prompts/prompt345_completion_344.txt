  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the program's control flow by throwing an exception, which could be caught by a `catch` block or propagate up the call stack.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the program's control flow by returning a promise that resolves to the exception, which could be handled by a `then` or `catch` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the program's control flow by returning a promise that rejects with the exception, which could be handled by a `catch` block.

DONE.
