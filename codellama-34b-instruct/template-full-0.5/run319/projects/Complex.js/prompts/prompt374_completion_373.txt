  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.cos()` function to return a different value, which would then be used to calculate the `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.cos()` function to return a different value, which would then be used to calculate the `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `Math.cos()` function to return a different value, which would then be used to calculate the `Complex` object.

DONE.
