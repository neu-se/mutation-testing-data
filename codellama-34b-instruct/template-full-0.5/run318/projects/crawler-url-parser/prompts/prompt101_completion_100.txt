  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set` would add a new entry to the map with the given key and value, whereas `urlMap.get` would retrieve the value associated with the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.size` would return the number of entries in the map, whereas `urlMap.get` would retrieve the value associated with the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.has` would return a boolean indicating whether the map contains the given key, whereas `urlMap.get` would retrieve the value associated with the given key.

DONE.
