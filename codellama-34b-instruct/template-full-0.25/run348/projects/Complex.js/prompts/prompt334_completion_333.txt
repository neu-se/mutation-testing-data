  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for equality instead of identity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality instead of identity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a positive value instead of zero.

DONE.
