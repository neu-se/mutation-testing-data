  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the two strings in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the individual characters of the two strings instead of the strings as a whole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the concatenation of the two strings instead of the strings as a whole.

DONE.
