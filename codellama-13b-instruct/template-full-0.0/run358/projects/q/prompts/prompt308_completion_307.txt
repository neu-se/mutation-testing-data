  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a `null` value instead of the original value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with the original value instead of a different value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the original value instead of a different value.

DONE.
