  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the mutated code fragment is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the mutated code fragment is a number literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the mutated code fragment is a null literal.

DONE.
