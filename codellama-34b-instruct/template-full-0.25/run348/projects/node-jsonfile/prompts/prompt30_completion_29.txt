  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `obj + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `obj.toString()` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `JSON.stringify(obj)` is a string.

DONE.
