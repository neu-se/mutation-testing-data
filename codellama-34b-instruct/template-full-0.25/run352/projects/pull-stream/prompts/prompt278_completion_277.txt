  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this replacement checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this replacement checks if `mapper` is a function and calls it with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this replacement checks if `mapper` is an empty array or an empty string.

DONE.
