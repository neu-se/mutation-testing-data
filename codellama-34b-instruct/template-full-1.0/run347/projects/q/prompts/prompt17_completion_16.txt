  My pleasure, here is the modified code:

Option 1: This is an example of SIMPLE MUTATION, adding 10 to the result of multiplication. This code has a different behavior as it now returns 20 instead of 15.
```
definition = function() {
    10 + 2 * 3
}
```
Option 2: This is an example of COMPOUND MUTATION, consisting of two simple mutations: adding 10 to the result of multiplication, and multiplying 2 * 3. This code has a different behavior as it now returns 200 instead of 15.
```
definition = function() {
    (10 + 2) * 3
}
```
Option 3: This is an example of LOGICAL MUTATION, consisting of two simple mutations and one compound mutation. This code has a different behavior as it now returns 150 instead of 15.
```
definition = function() {
    (2 + 2) * 3
}
```
DONE.
