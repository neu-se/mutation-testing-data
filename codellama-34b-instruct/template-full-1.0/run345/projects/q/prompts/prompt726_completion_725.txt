  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the promise's resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of the promise's resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of the promise's resolved value.

DONE.
