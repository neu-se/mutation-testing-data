 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all key-value pairs from the `_data` map, whereas the original code only removes the key-value pair associated with the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has(key) && this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key exists in the `_data` map before attempting to delete it, whereas the original code does not perform this check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data['delete'](key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation to access the `delete` method, which is equivalent to the original code but may have different behavior due to differences in how JavaScript handles property access using dot notation vs. bracket notation.

DONE.
