  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `all` and would return a promise that is resolved with the value of the first resolved promise, or a rejected promise if all promises are rejected, whereas `all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of the resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is not a method in the `Promise` prototype and would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method than `all` and would return a promise that is resolved with an array of the states of the respective values, whereas `all` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of the resolved values.

DONE.
