```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, causing the replace function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, causing the replace function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, causing the replace function to fail.

DONE.
