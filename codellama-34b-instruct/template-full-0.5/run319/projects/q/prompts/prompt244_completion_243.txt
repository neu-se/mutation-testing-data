  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `state` property, but the `state` property is not accessed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `value` property, but the `value` property is not accessed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect().reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `reason` property, but the `reason` property is not accessed in the original code.

DONE.
