 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('url').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly specifies the `url` module, while the original code relies on the implicit `global.url` object. This change might expose issues related to module resolution or differences between Node.js versions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the global `URL` object instead of the `url` module. This change might expose compatibility issues between the browser and Node.js environments or differences in the `URL` object implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.prototype.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `parse` method on the `URL` prototype, which is not a function. This change would cause a `TypeError`, highlighting potential issues with the code's assumptions about the `URL` object.

DONE.
