This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would return a function that always returns a promise that is rejected with a `TypeError` when called, instead of a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the result of calling the original function with the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
