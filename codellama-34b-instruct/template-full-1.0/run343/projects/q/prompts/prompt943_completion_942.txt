  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not an object, and it cannot have properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not an object, and it cannot have properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = x + y;
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not an object, and it cannot have properties or methods.

DONE.
