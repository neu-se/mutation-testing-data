  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reduce` method with an initial value of `0`, while this replacement would use the `reduce` method with an initial value of `{}`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr) => accum - curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reduce` method with an initial value of `0`, while this replacement would use the `reduce` method with an initial value of `{}`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr) => accum * curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reduce` method with an initial value of `0`, while this replacement would use the `reduce` method with an initial value of `{}`.

DONE.
