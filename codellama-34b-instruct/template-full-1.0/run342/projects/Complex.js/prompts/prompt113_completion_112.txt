  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
1; this instanceof Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
this instanceOf Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the object passed to the Complex constructor may not be an instance of Object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
this instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is not an instance of Complex.

DONE.
