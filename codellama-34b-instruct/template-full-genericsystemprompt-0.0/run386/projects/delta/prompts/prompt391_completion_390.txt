  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over operations that should be considered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the next operation without advancing to it, potentially leading to duplicate operations being considered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the length of the next operation without advancing to it, potentially leading to incorrect calculations of the offset.

DONE.
