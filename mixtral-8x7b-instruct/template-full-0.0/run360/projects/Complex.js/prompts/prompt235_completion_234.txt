 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it unnecessarily includes a constant multiplier, which would affect the final result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the absolute value instead of the square root, which would lead to incorrect results in the complex square root calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential instead of the square root, which would lead to incorrect results in the complex square root calculation.

DONE.
