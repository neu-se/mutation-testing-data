  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` would return `true` if `ses` is not defined, whereas `!ses.ok()` would return `true` if `ses` is not defined or if `ses.ok()` returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ses.notOk()` would return `true` if `ses` is defined and `ses.notOk()` returns `false`, whereas `!ses.ok()` would return `true` if `ses` is not defined or if `ses.ok()` returns `false`.
