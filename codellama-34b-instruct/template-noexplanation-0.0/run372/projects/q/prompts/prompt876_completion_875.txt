  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 1)
```
This will cause the `array_slice` function to be called with a `this` value of `null` and a first argument of `1`, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 2)
```
This will cause the `array_slice` function to be called with a `this` value of `null` and a first argument of `2`, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 3)
```
This will cause the `array_slice` function to be called with a `this` value of `null` and a first argument of `3`, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
