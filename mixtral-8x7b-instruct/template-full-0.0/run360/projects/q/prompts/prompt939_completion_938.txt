 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, while `concat` returns a new array without modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array and returns an array of deleted elements, which is not the desired behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseArgs.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` converts the array into a string, which is not compatible with the expected arguments for `Q.nbind`.

DONE.
