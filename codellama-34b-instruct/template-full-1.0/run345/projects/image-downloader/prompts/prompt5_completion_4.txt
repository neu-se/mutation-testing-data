  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, while `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. If the code using the mutated function is not handling rejected promises properly, it may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Different error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a rejected promise with a different error message than the original code. This can make it harder to debug issues and understand the root cause of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callSomeOtherFunction()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a different function than the one specified in the original code. Depending on the implementation of `callSomeOtherFunction()`, it may lead to different behavior, such as a different set of side effects or interactions with other parts of the system.

DONE.
