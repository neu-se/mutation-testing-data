  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return the first element of the array, regardless of its type or position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return the last element of the array, regardless of its type or position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(anonymous function)
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return a new function that, when invoked, would return the next argument in the array.

DONE.
