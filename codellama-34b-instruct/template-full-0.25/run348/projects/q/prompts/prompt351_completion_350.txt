  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as the third argument to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the original exception.

DONE.
