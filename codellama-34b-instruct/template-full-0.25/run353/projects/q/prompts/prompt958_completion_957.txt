  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when attempting to invoke it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when attempting to invoke it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be invoked instead of the original `bound` function, which would cause the promise to resolve with a different value.

DONE.
