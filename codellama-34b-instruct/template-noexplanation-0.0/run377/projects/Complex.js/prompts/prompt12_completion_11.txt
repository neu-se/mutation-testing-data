  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This is the original code fragment that was intended to be used in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This is a simple replacement that will not affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This will cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
