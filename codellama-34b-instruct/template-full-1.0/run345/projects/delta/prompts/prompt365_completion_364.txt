  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` is always `true`, so this condition will always be true, even if `otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' || otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is true, then the expression will always be true, regardless of the value of `otherIter.peekType()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && !otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is true and `otherIter.peekType()` is `null` or `undefined`, then the expression will
