  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.delete(key)` would delete the key from the data object, whereas `key` would simply return the key as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(key)` would return the value associated with the key in the data object, whereas `key` would simply return the key as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.set(key, this._data.get(key))` would set the value associated with the key in the data object to the value associated with the key, whereas `key` would simply return the key as a string.

DONE.
