  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is a property of the `result` object, not the `result` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.promise` is a promise that resolves to the `result` object, not the `result` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.then(function (value) { return value; })` is a promise that resolves to the `value` of the `result` object, not the `result` object itself.

DONE.
