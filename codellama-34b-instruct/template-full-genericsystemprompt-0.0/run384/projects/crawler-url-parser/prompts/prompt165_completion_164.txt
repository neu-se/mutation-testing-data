  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `includes` method to check if the `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path`, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `includes` method to check if the `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path` with a length of `pageurl_path.length`, which is not the same as checking if `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `includes` method to check if the `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path` with a length of `linkurl_path.length`, which is not the
