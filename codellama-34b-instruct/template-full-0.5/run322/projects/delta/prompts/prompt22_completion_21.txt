  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would always return the opposite of `isEqual`, which means that the `diff` function would always return a non-empty object, even if the two objects are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the values of the two objects at the same key are not equal, rather than checking if the values are equal. This would cause the `diff` function to always return a non-empty object, even if the two objects are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a[key] && b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `a` at the current key is falsy and the value of `b` at the same key is truthy. This would cause the `diff` function to always return a non-
