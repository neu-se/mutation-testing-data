  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+' || c === '-'
```
This modification will cause the code to treat both plus and minus signs as valid operators, which may lead to unexpected behavior in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+' && c !== '-'
```
This modification will cause the code to only treat plus signs as valid operators, which may lead to unexpected behavior in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+' || c === '-' || c === '*'
```
This modification will cause the code to treat plus, minus, and multiplication signs as valid operators, which may lead to unexpected behavior in certain cases.

DONE.
