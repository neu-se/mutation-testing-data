This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to `undefined` instead of the actual policy object, causing the `query` and `matches` methods to always return `null` or `false`, even if the policy is present in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = new Policy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to a new, empty policy object instead of the actual policy object, causing the `query` and `matches` methods to always return `null` or `false`, even if the policy is
