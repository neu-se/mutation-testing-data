  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a specific value, whereas `null` is a null pointer. If `null` is used, the function will not return any value, whereas `undefined` will return a `NaN` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a specific value, whereas `null` is a null pointer. If `null` is used, the function will not return any value, whereas `NaN` will return a `NaN` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a specific value, whereas `null` is a null pointer. If `null` is used, the function will not return any value, whereas `Infinity` will return an infinite value.

DONE.
