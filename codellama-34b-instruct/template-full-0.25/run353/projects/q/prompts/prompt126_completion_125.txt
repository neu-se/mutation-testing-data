  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be an object, but `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be an object, but `{}` is an empty object.

DONE.
