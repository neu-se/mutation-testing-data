  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the operation being performed on the `retDelta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the operation being performed on the `retDelta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherDelta` is a different object than `retDelta`, and it would change the target of the `push` operation.

DONE.
