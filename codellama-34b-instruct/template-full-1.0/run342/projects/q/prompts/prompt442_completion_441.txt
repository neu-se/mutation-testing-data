  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejectionTracker"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be incorrect, and the event would not be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be incorrect, and the event would not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be incorrect, and the event would not be emitted.

DONE.
