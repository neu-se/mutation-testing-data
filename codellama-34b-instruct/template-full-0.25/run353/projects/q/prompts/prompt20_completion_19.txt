  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick = function (task) {
    setTimeout(task, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is not a part of the Node.js event loop, and it would not be executed in the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick = function (task) {
    task();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` would be executed immediately, rather than in the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick = function (task) {
    task.call(null);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `task.call(null)` would execute the `task` function with a `this` value of `null`, rather than the `this` value of the `nextTick` function.

DONE.
