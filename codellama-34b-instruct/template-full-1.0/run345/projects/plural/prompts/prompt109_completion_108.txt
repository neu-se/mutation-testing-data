  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:goggle|scissor|plier|tong|tweezer)s\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would match "goggle" and "scissor," but not "plier," "tong," or "tweezer," which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/this/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would match any string, which would cause the test to pass even if the input string was not a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\bNone\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern would not match any string, which would cause the test to fail even if the input string was a valid plural form.

DONE.
