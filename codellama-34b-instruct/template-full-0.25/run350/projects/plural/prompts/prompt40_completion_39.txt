  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "ices" for words that end with "x", but the new code fragment would return "ices" for words that end with "x" or "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "ices" for words that end with "x", but the new code fragment would return "ices" for words that end with "x" or "y".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + '
