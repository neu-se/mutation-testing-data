  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "Hello, world!" instead of the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the array [1, 2, 3] instead of the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return null instead of the arguments object.

DONE.
