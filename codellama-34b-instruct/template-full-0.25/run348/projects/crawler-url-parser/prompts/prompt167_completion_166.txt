  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the includes() method checks if the first string is a substring of the second string, whereas the original code fragment checks if the second string is a substring of the first string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf() method checks if the first string is a substring of the second string, whereas the original code fragment checks if the second string is a substring of the first string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the startsWith() method checks if the first string starts with the second string, whereas the original code fragment checks if the second string is a substring of the first string.

DONE.
