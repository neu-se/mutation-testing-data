  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input `stackLine`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, regardless of the input `stackLine`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to only return `true` if the input `stackLine` contains the string `"(module.js:"`.

DONE.
