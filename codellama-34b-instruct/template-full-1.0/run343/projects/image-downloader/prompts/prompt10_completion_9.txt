  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement's condition is always false, causing the `Promise.reject` to be called with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid value for the `path.extname` function, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not equal to any other value, including itself, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, leading to the same result as Option 1.

DONE.
