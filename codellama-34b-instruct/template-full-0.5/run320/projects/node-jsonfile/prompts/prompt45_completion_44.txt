  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it could lead to a different encoding being used for the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is not the same as `options`, and it could lead to a different error handling strategy being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is not the same as `options`, and it could lead to a different reviver function being used for the JSON parsing.

DONE.
