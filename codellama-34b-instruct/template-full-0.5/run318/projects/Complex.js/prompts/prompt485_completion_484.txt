  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assume that the module is an object, when it may not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assume that the exports are a function, when they may not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assume that the define function is not defined, when it may be.

DONE.
