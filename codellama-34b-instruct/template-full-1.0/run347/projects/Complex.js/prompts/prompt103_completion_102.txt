  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because `plus` and `minus` are both integers, and `plus > minus` would evaluate to `true` if `plus` is greater than `minus`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus % minus
```
This would result in different behavior because `plus % minus` is not the same as `plus + minus > 0`. The former is a modulo operation that will evaluate to the remainder of `plus` divided by `minus`, while the latter is a comparison that will evaluate to `true` if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus
```
This would result in different behavior because `plus - minus` is not the same as `plus + minus > 0`. The former is a subtraction operation that will evaluate to the difference of `plus` and `minus`, while
