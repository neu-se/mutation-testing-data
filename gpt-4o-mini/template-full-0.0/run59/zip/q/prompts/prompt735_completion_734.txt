Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native `Promise.all` method instead of the custom `all` function, which may not handle promises in the same way, particularly in terms of error handling and promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `any` function instead of `all`, which means it will return the first resolved promise rather than waiting for all promises to resolve, leading to a fundamentally different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `allResolved` function, which waits for all promises to settle (either fulfilled or rejected) rather than only resolving when all promises are fulfilled, thus changing the conditions under which the promise resolves.

DONE.
