  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a different method than `Q`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different method than `Q`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` is a different method than `Q`, and it may not have the same behavior or functionality.

DONE.
