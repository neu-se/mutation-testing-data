  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, which is to return the plural form of the word "criterion" for any number greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the plural form of the word "criteria" for any number greater than 1, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the plural form of the word "criterions" for any number greater than 1, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
