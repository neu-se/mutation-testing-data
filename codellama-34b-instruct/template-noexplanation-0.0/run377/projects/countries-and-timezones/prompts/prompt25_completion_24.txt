  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This code fragment is a function call that passes the `dstOffset` variable as an argument to the `getOffsetStr` function. The `getOffsetStr` function returns a string representation of the offset, which is then assigned to the `dstOffsetStr` property of the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it passes the `utcOffset` variable as an argument to the `getOffsetStr` function instead of the `dstOffset` variable. This will result in a different string representation of the offset being assigned to the `dstOffsetStr` property of the `result` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset + utcOffset)
```
This code fragment passes the sum of the `dstOffset` and `utcOffset` variables as an argument to the `getOffset
