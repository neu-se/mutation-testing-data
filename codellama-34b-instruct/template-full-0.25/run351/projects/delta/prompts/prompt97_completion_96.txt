  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start changing the array, and the second is the number of elements to remove. In this case, `1` would be interpreted as the number of elements to remove, which would result in the wrong behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start changing the array, and the second is the number of elements to remove. In this case, `-1` would be interpreted as the index at which to start changing the array, which would result in the wrong behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start changing the array, and the second is the number of elements to remove.
