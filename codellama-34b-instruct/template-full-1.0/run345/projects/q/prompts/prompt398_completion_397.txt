  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `undefined` instead of `value`, which could cause problems downstream in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `null` instead of `value`, which could cause problems downstream in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenResolve` method to return `0` instead of `value`, which could cause problems downstream in the code.

DONE.
