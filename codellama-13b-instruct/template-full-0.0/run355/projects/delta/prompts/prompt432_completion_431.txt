  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp.delete` property is not defined, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, which would return an infinite `retain` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp.retain` property is not defined, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, which would return an infinite `retain` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp.insert` property is not defined, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would be executed, which would return an infinite `retain` operation.

DONE.
