  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength` returns the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next operation in the iterator and advances the iterator, while `peekLength` returns the length of the current operation without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
