  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an identifier that refers to a variable or object property, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant value, while `Math.random()` is a function that returns a random number between 0 and 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an identifier that refers to a variable or object property, while `this.re` is a property accessor that refers to a different variable or object property.

DONE.
