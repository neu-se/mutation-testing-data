  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` would return an array of values from the stream, whereas `values` would return the `values` function from the `require` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.once
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.once` would return a function that takes a single argument and returns a promise that resolves with the first value from the stream, whereas `once` is a function that takes a function and returns a new function that can only be called once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.map` would return a new stream that applies the given function to each value from the original stream, whereas `values` would return an array of values from the stream.

DONE.
