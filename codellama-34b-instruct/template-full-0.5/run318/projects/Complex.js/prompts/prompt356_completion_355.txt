  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a reference to the `b` variable, while `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `b`. If the test case expects the value of `b` to be a specific value, then the test case will fail when `b + 1` is used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a reference to the `b` variable, while `b * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of `b` by 2. If the test case expects the value of `b` to be a specific value, then the test case will fail when `b * 2` is used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b
