  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is called with the wrong argument. The original code fragment passes the `data` argument to `source`, while this new code fragment passes the `acc` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is called with a different argument. The original code fragment passes the `data` argument to `source`, while this new code fragment passes `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is called with a different argument. The original code fragment passes the `data` argument to `source`, while this new code fragment passes `undefined`.

DONE.
