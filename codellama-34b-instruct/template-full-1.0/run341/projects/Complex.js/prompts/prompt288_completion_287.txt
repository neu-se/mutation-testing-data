  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to `Math.sin()`, causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to `Math.sin()`, causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to `Math.sin()`, causing the function to return a different value.

DONE.
