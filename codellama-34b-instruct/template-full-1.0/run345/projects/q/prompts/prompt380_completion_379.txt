  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var foo = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is not a promise and would not have a `tap` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because `123` is not a promise and would not have a `tap` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Q()` creates a new promise that is not related to the original promise, so the `tap` method would not be called on the original promise.

DONE.
