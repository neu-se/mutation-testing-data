  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would always return the opposite of `isEqual`, which could cause the `diff` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is not a valid function in JavaScript, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is the strict inequality operator, and would always return `true` if the two operands are not the same object, even if they have the same properties and values.

DONE.
