  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the next operation in the `thisIter` iterator is an insert operation, rather than a delete operation. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `thisIter` iterator contains insert operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator is a delete operation, rather than a retain operation. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `otherIter` iterator contains delete operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking if the next operation in the `thisIter` iterator is a retain operation, rather than a delete operation. This could potentially
