  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is a different property than `baseOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.length` is a different property than `baseOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain` is a different property than `baseOp.attributes`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
