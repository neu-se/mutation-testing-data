Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text("Error").trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the text extracted from the anchor element to a fixed string "Error", which would not reflect the actual text content of the link, potentially leading to incorrect URL mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let text = $(this).text().toUpperCase().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the text to uppercase, which could cause issues when checking for duplicate texts in the URL map, as "Link" and "link" would be treated as different entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let text = $(this).attr('title').trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the source of the text from the anchor's visible text to its title attribute, which may not always be present, leading to potential loss of information or incorrect URL mapping.

DONE.
