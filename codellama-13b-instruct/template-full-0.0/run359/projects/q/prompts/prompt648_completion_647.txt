  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the array would be a number instead of an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, "test"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the array would be a string instead of an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, function() { console.log("test"); }]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the array would be a function instead of an array of arguments.

DONE.
