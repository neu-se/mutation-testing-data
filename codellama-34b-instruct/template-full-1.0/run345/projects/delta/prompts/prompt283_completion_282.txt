  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tries to find the index of a substring in a larger string, while the replaced code simply returns -1, which would lead to different behavior in the context of the overall program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tries to find the index of a substring in a larger string, while the replaced code would return Infinity, which would lead to different behavior in the context of the overall program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tries to find the index of a substring in a larger string, while the replaced code would return null, which would lead to different behavior in the context of the overall program.

DONE.
