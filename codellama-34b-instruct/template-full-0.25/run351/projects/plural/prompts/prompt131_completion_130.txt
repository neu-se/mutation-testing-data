  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` returns an array of matches, whereas `test` returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, whereas `test` returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].search(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match, whereas `test` returns a boolean indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not.

DONE.
