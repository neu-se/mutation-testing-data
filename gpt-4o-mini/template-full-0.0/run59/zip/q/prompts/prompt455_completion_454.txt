Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the untracking of rejections when tracking is enabled, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, preventing any untracking of rejections regardless of the state of `trackUnhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, causing the function to exit early and never untrack any rejections, regardless of the actual state of `trackUnhandledRejections`.

DONE.
