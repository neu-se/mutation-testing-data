 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the first argument to `Q.denodeify.apply()`, which might cause an error if the function expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this, args
