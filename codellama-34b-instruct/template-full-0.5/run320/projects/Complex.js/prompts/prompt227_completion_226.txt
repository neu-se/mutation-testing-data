  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which returns the value of the variable `a`. However, `a + 1` returns the value of `a` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which returns the value of the variable `a`. However, `a * 2` returns the value of `a` multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which returns the value of the variable `a`. However, `a - 1` returns the value of `a` minus 1.

DONE.
