 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a hardcoded string 'geese' for the plural of 'goose', while the mutated code suggests a different plural form 'gooses'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code correctly identifies the plural form of 'goose' as 'geese', while the mutated code would return 'gooe' instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a specific rule for 'goose' to return 'geese', while the mutated code would return 'goosees' instead.

DONE.
