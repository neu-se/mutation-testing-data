  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the zip function to read from the target folder, but not write to it. In the original code, both read and write access are required.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the zip function to write to the target folder, but not read from it. In the original code, both read and write access are required.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the zip function to access any folder, not just the target folder. In the original code, access to the target folder is specifically checked.

DONE.
