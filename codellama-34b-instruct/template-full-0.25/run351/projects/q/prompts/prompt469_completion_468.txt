  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = "buggy reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `unhandledReasons` array, which is used to track unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = unhandledReasons[at] + "buggy reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "buggy reason" to the existing value in the `unhandledReasons` array, which would change the behavior of the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value in the `unhandledReasons` array to `null`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to behave differently.

DONE.
