  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` and `buildTimezone` are different functions with different purposes, and using `buildTimezone` instead of `buildCountry` in the `deliverCountry` function would cause the country object to be constructed using the incorrect function, potentially leading to errors in the resulting data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` is a function that expects an object as an argument, but `buildTimezone` is a function that expects a string. Passing an empty object to `buildCountry` would cause it to return an object with no properties, which would be different from the object returned by `buildTimezone` with the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` is a function that expects two arguments, while `buildTimezone`
