  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the other iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to miss a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator back one element, potentially causing the algorithm to re-visit an element that was already processed.

DONE.
