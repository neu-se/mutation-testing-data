  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the second condition will be evaluated first. In the original code, the second condition is only evaluated if the first condition is true. In the modified code, the second condition is always evaluated, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is more strict than the `!=` operator. In the original code, the function checks if the attribute value is different from the base value using `!=` and then checks if the base value is undefined using `=== undefined`. In the modified code, the function checks if the attribute value is different from the base value using `!==` and then checks if the base value is undefined using `!== undefined`. This could
