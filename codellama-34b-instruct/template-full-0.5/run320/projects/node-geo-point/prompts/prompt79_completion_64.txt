  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is being used instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being increased by 1, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function is being applied to the latitude value, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
