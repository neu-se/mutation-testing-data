  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `next` method to return a different value than it would have with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `next` method to return a different value than it would have with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `next` method to return a different value than it would have with the original code.

DONE.
