  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `index` variable as a zero-based index, while the modified code uses a one-based index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `index` variable as a linear index, while the modified code uses a quadratic index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `index` variable as a zero-based index, while the modified code uses a negative-based index.

DONE.
