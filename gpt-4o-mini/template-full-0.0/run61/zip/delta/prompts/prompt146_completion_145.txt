Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to consume only one unit of the operation, potentially skipping over larger operations that should be processed, leading to incorrect composition of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next` with a length of zero may not advance the iterator at all, causing the same operation to be processed repeatedly and potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect delta composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `otherIter` iterator to advance instead of `thisIter`, which would mix operations from the other delta into the current delta, resulting in an incorrect composition of operations.

DONE.
