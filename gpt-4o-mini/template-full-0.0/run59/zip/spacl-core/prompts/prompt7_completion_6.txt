Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\w+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a forward slash followed by a word character, which would not catch paths with empty segments (i.e., consecutive slashes) but would incorrectly allow paths like `/a` or `/1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `includes` method to check for double slashes, which would not match the same way as a regex and could lead to false positives if the path contains a single slash followed by any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/{2,}/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for two or more consecutive slashes instead of just one, which would allow paths with single slashes to pass through validation, thus missing the detection of empty segments.

DONE.
