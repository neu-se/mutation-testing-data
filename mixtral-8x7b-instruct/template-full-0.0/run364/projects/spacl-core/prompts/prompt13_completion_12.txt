 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a character other than '/' followed by a colon (`[^/]:`), instead of just checking for a colon preceded by any character (`[^/]:`). This change would cause the regex to fail to match certain valid paths, such as `:foo`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[^/]:|:\/|:[a-zA-Z]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only allows alph
