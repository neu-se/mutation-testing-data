  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `isInfinite` method to check if the complex number is at the infinity pole, while this code fragment uses the `isNaN` and `isFinite` methods to check if the complex number is not a number or not finite, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']() || this['isZero']());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check if the complex number is at the zero pole, while this code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']() || this['isZero']() || this['isInfinite']());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check if
