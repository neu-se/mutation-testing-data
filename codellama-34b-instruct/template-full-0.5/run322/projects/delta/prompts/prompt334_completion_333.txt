  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different property than `attributes`, and using it in the same context would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `attributes`, and using it in the same context would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`, and using it in the same context would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
