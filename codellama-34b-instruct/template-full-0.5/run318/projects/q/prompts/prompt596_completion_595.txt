  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `this` value to be null, which could potentially cause errors in the `callback.apply()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `this` value to be undefined, which could potentially cause errors in the `callback.apply()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `this` value to be an empty object, which could potentially cause errors in the `callback.apply()` method.

DONE.
