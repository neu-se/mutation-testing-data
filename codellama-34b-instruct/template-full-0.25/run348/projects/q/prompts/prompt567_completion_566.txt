  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and `when` expects a promise as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and `when` expects a promise as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(result)` is a promise that resolves to the value of `result`, whereas `result` is the value of the promise returned by `all(arguments)`.

DONE.
