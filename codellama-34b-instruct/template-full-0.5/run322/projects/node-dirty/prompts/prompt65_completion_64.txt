  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that indicates that there will be no more data to write, whereas `destroy()` is a method that immediately destroys the stream and cancels any pending writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `write(null)` is a method that writes a null value to the stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that immediately destroys the stream and cancels any pending writes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.emit('error', new Error('Some error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit('error', new Error('Some error'))` is a method that emits an error event with a custom error message, whereas `destroy()` is a method that immediately destroys the stream and cancels
