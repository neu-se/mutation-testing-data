 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
`/[${part}]/`
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches a single character present in the `part` variable instead of replacing special characters with their escaped version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
`/${part.split('').join('\\.')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because it escapes every character in the `part` variable, including non-special ones, which can cause unexpected matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
`/${part.replace(/[^\w]/g, '\\$1')}/`
```
This would result in different behavior because it only escapes characters that are not word characters (letters, digits, and underscores), which can cause issues with special characters like `.` and `$`.

DONE.
