  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error("Timeout")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, rather than the original error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, "Timeout"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a string, rather than an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, rather than being rejected.

DONE.
