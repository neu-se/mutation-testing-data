  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'testing'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return true, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return false, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return false, regardless of the input, and would also throw a TypeError because it would be trying to call a function on undefined.

DONE.
