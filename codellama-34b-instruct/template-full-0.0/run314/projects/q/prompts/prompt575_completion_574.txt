  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `bind` is a method that creates a new function with a given `this` value and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `bind` is a method that creates a new function with a given `this` value and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
