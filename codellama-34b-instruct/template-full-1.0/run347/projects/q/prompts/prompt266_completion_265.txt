  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `become` function to be called immediately when `resolvedPromise` is not yet defined, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `become` function to be called only if `resolvedPromise` is set to `true`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `become` function to be called if `resolvedPromise` is set to a non-`true` value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
