  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is not a method of `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid argument for `makeNodeResolver`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not a `Q` object.

DONE.
