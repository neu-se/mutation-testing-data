  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `a` is not equal to the string `'object'`, which is not the same as checking if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `a` is falsy or if `a` is not an object, which is not the same as checking if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Object(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `a` is not equal to the object representation of `a`, which is not the same as checking if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
