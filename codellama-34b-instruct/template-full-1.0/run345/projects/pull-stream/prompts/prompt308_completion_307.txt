  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `!ended`, which is the negation of the `ended` variable, instead of `null` or `ended`. This would cause the loop to continue even when the `ended` variable is set to `true`, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `true`, regardless of the value of `ended`. This would cause the loop to continue infinitely, even when `ended` is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `false`, regardless of the value of `ended`. This would cause the loop to continue infinitely, even when `ended` is set to `true`.

DONE.
