 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operands for the conditional (ternary) operator, which may lead to unexpected behavior if `options.reviver` is falsy but not explicitly `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `undefined` as the second argument to `JSON.parse`, which may cause the parsing to fail or behave differently if the input string contains special characters or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the null coalescing operator (`||`), which may cause a `TypeError` if `options.reviver` is not provided or is not a function.

DONE.
