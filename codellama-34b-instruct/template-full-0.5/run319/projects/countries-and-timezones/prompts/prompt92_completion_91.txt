  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `country` object to the `getCountry()` function, rather than the `countryId` variable that was originally passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"countryId"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string literal instead of a variable, and the `getCountry()` function would not be able to find the corresponding country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of a country ID, and the `getCountry()` function would not be able to find the corresponding country.

DONE.
