  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property is not checked in the original code, and `this._queue.size` could be greater than 0 even if the queue is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length > 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not checked in the original code, and `this._queue.length` could be greater than 0 even if the queue is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 || this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which could cause the `_flush` method to be called even if the queue is empty.

DONE.
