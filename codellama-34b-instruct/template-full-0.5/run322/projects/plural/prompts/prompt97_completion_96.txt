  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a case-insensitive match (`i` flag) and a non-capturing group (`(?:wo)?`) to match the word "woman" or "man," while the new code fragment uses a case-sensitive match and a capturing group to match the word "woman" or "man."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the letter "a" with "e," while the new code fragment replaces the letter "o" with "e."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/
