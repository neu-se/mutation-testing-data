  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` would dispatch the `apply` event to the instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch(name, args)` would dispatch the `name` event with the `args` arguments, whereas `this.dispatch` alone would dispatch the `name` event with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.Promise.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.Promise.dispatch` would dispatch the `name` event to the `this.Promise` instance, whereas `this.dispatch` alone would dispatch the `name` event to the current instance.

DONE.
