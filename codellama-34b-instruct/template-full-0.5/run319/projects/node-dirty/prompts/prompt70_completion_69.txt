  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event would not be emitted, and the `'error'` event would be emitted instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event would not be emitted, and the `'close'` event would be emitted instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'load'` event would not be emitted, and the `'drain'` event would be emitted instead.

DONE.
