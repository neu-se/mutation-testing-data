  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reverse the array of path segments, which could cause the matcher to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
