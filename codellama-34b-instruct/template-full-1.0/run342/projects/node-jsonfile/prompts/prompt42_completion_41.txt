  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` returns a string representation of the input object, while `null` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a method of the `String` prototype, while `stringify` is a method of the `JSON` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a method that converts a JavaScript object to a string, while `stringify` is a method that converts a JavaScript object to a string using a callback function.

DONE.
