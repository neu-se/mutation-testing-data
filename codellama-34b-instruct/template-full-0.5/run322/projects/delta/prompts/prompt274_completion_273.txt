  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the next operation is an insert, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit early if the next operation is an insert, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the next operation is an insert, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
