  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Unhandled rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Unhandled rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific reason, even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the same reason as the original promise, even if the original promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
