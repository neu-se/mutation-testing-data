  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test = prop(<PLACEHOLDER>) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is not defined in the current scope, so the `test` variable would be assigned the value `id` instead of the expected value from the `prop` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test = prop(<PLACEHOLDER>) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is not defined in the current scope, so the `test` variable would be assigned the value `id` instead of the expected value from the `prop` function.

DONE.
