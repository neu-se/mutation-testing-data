  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with code fragments that exhibit different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.nbind.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is not called on the correct object, which would cause the code to fail to execute as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.nbind.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.nbind` is not a function, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would return a reference to the `Promise` object rather than the `bind` function, which would cause the code to fail to execute as expected.

DONE.
