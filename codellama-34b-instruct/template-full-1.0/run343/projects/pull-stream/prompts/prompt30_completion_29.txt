  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the array index is `2`, while in the changed code, it is `3`, which will cause different values to be passed to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, only `ref[2]` is passed as a parameter to `pull`, while in the changed code, `ref[1]` and `ref[2]` are added together and then passed as a parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var temp = ref[2]
temp[0] = ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `ref[2]` is passed as a parameter to `pull`, while in the changed code, `ref[1]` is assigned to `temp`, and then `temp` is passed as a parameter
