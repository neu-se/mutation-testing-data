Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if either `this` or `z` is zero, ignoring the case where both are infinite, which would lead to a division by zero scenario returning `Infinity` instead of `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is infinite while `z` is not, which would incorrectly allow division by an infinite number, potentially leading to unexpected results instead of returning `NaN` when both are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && !z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is zero while `z` is not, which would incorrectly allow division by zero when `z` is a non-zero complex number, leading to a return of `0` instead of `NaN`.

DONE.
