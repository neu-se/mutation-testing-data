  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `min` is less than 1, while this replacement checks if `min` is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `max` is equal to 1, while this replacement checks if `max` is equal to 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `any` is truthy, while this replacement checks if `any` is strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
