  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds elements to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.rules.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array containing the concatenated elements, whereas `push` mutates the original array and returns its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.rules.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` mutates the original array and adds elements at a specific position, whereas `push` adds elements to the end.

DONE.
