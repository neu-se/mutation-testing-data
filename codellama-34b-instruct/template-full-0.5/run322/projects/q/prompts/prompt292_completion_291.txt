  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to the `resolver` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with `undefined` as an argument, rather than passing it as a callback to the `resolver` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `notify` method with `null` as an argument, rather than passing it as a callback to the `resolver` function.

DONE.
