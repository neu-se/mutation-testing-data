  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method would be a string instead of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method would be null instead of a number.

DONE.
