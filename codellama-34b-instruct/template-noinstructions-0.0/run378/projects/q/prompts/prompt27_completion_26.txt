  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `domain` property is truthy, while replacing it with `null` would cause the check to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `domain` property is truthy, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the check to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `domain` property is truthy, while replacing it with `0` would cause the check to always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
