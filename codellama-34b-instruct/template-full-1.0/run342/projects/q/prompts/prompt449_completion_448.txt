  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection()
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection()` is a function that marks a rejected promise as handled, but it is called without any arguments, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a variable that refers to the rejected promise, but it is not a function, so it would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, but it is not a promise, so it would not have a `then` method that can be called.

DONE.
