  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute, but this replacement code fragment checks if `options.dest` is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && !path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute, but this replacement code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute and is not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute, but this replacement code fragment checks if `options.dest` is not absolute and is absolute.

DONE.
