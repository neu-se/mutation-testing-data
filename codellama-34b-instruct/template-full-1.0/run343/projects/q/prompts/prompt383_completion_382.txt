  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with any arguments, which could cause the `then` method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with any arguments, which could cause the `then` method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with any arguments, which could cause the `then` method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
