  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the starting position of the current section of the base and is necessary for the calculation to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the starting position of the current section of the base and is necessary for the calculation to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the starting position of the current section of the base and is necessary for the calculation to work correctly.

DONE.
