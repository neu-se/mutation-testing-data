  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the rule array as the second argument to the function, instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third element of the rule array as the second argument to the function, instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth element of the rule array as the second argument to the function, instead of the first element.

DONE.
