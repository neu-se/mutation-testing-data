  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, starting from the end of the array and moving towards the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, potentially missing important data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = length - index;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, starting from the end of the array and moving towards the beginning.

DONE.
