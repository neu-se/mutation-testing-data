  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, while `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the value `null`, while `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, while `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
