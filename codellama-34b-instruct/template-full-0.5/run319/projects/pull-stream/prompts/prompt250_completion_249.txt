  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a `null` error argument, which would cause the `read` function to return `null` instead of the expected `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` argument set to the expected `data` argument, which would cause the `read` function to return the `err` argument instead of the expected `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with both arguments set to `null`, which would cause the `read` function to return `null` instead of the expected `data` argument.

DONE.
