  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return `Infinity` when the input `x` is `Infinity`, which would then cause the `sinh` function to return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return `NaN` when the input `x` is `0`, which would then cause the `sinh` function to return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to return `0` when the input `x` is `Infinity`, which would then cause the `sinh` function to return `0`.

DONE.
