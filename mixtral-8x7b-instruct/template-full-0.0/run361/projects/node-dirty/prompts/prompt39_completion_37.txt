 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will not break even if the `fn` function returns a truthy value, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn(val, key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the `fn` function are swapped, which may cause the function to behave differently or even cause it to fail, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn.call(null, key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to explicitly set the `this` context within the `fn` function. By setting `this` to `null`, the function may not have access to the expected context, causing it to behave differently or fail.

DONE.
