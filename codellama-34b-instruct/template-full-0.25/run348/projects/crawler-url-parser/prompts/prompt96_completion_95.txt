  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra comma at the end of the argument list, which could cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the two arguments instead of passing them as separate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr + 'foo',
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a string 'foo' to the end of the baseUrlStr argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
