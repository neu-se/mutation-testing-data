  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(this, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of the elements of an array, whereas `slice` is a built-in method that returns a subset of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(this, function(x) { return x[index]; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a built-in method that creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `map` is a method that returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce(this, function(acc, x) { return acc.concat(x[index]); }, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a built-in method that applies a function against
