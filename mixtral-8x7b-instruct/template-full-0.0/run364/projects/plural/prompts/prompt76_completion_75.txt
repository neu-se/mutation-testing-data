 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word 'die' would not be correctly pluralized to 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word 'die' would be incorrectly pluralized to 'dies' instead of 'dice'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always append 'es' to the input word, regardless of its original form, resulting in incorrect pluralization for many words.

DONE.
