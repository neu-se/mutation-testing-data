  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be evaluated to `true` or `false`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to a reference to the `isInfinite` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be evaluated with the argument `a`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to a reference to the `isInfinite` function without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would evaluate to a number, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to a reference to the `isInfinite` function.

DONE.
