  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the input URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return true, regardless of the input URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return null, regardless of the input URL.

DONE.
