  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality without converting the operands. This could cause the code to behave differently if the operands have different types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part !== pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while the new code checks for inequality. This could cause the code to behave differently if the operands are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.length === pageurl_without_last_part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality between the two strings, while the new
