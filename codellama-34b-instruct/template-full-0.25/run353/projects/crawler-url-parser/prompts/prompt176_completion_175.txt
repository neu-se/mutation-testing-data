  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.href` returns the entire URL, including the protocol and domain, while `url` returns the path and query string only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.pathname` returns the path and query string only, while `url` returns the entire URL, including the protocol and domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.search` returns the query string only, while `url` returns the entire URL, including the protocol and domain.

DONE.
