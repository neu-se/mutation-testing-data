  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect == void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `inspect` is not undefined, even if it's null or an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `inspect` is null, and not if it's undefined or another falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect != void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `inspect` is not undefined, null, or an empty string, and not if it's a falsy value.

DONE.
