 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.call(null, <PLACEHOLDER>, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `this` value of the `op` function call from the original object to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op(args)
