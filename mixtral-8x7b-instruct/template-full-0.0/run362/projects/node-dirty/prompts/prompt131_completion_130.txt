 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(this._queue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the queue object instead of the actual queue values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the queue array, which would not reflect changes made to the original queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.filter(x => x)
