 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the `b` component in the result would be flipped, as the original code uses the absolute value of `a` in the calculation of `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be inverted along the imaginary axis if `a` is non-zero, as the original code uses `a` directly in the calculation of `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be scaled by a factor of `e^a` if `a` is non-zero, as the original code uses `a` directly in the calculation of `d`.

DONE.
