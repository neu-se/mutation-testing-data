  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the peeked operation, rather than the length of the operation that was not peeked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the text in the peeked operation, rather than the length of the operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the text in the peeked operation, rather than the length of the operation itself.

DONE.
