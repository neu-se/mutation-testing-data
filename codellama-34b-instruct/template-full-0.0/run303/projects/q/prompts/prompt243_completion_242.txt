  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. The `===` operator checks for strict equality, so this replacement would cause the code to enter the `if` block only if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled()` is a method that checks if a promise has been resolved or rejected, and it returns a boolean value. If `resolvedPromise` is not a promise object, this replacement would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `state` is a property of a promise object that indicates its current state, and it can have the values "p
