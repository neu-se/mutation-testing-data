 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.indexOf.call(tmpUrl.text, text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the text exists in the `tmpUrl.text` using `indexOf` instead of the `includes` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `text` matches the `tmpUrl.text` using the `match` method instead of the `includes` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tmpUrl.text.search(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `text` exists in the `tmpUrl.text` using the `search` method instead of the `includes` method.

DONE.
