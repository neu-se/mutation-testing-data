  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `φ2` uses `φ1` as an input, and changing it to `φ1` would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `φ2` uses `φ1` as an input, and adding 1 to `φ1` would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `φ2` uses `φ1` as an input, and adding `φ2` to `φ1` would result in a different output.

DONE.
