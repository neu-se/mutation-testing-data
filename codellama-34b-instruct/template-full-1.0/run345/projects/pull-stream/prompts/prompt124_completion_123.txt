  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(end <= 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks whether `end` is less than or equal to 0. If `end` is a number, this new code fragment will always return `false`, whereas the original code fragment may return `true` if `end` is a truthy number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(end > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks whether `end` is greater than 0. If `end` is a number, this new code fragment will always return `false`, whereas the original code fragment may return `true` if `end` is a truthy number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(++end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `end
