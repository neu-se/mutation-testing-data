  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the existence of the `abort` parameter, while this modified code fragment checks for the existence of the `abort` parameter and whether it is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the existence of the `abort` parameter, while this modified code fragment checks for the existence of the `abort` parameter and whether it is truthy or falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the existence of the `abort` parameter, while this modified code fragment always returns 1, regardless of the value of the `abort` parameter.

DONE.
