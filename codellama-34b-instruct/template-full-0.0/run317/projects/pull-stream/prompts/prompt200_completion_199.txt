  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would enter the `if` block even if `busy` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the code would enter the `if` block only if `busy` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would enter the `if` block only if `busy` is not `true`.

DONE.
