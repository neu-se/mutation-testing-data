  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable would not be taken into account when computing the `pow` function, which could lead to potential errors or discrepancies in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable would be assigned a default value of 1 instead of 0, which could lead to potential errors or discrepancies in the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places * 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `places` variable would be multiplied by 5 instead of 10, which could lead to potential errors or discrepancies in the output.

DONE.
