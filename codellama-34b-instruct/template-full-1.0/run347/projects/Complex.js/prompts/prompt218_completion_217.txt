  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different periodicities and ranges, which could lead to significant changes in the results of complex exponential, logarithmic, and other calculations that depend on trigonometric functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + 1) / (a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the input value, which could change the results of some calculations that involve dividing by the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, which could completely alter the results of calculations that depend on the value of the input parameter.

DONE.
