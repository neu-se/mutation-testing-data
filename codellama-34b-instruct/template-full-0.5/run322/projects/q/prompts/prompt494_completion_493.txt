  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `reason`, which could change the outcome of the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `reason` by 2, which could change the outcome of the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `reason`, which could change the outcome of the `reject` function.

DONE.
