  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the variable `a` is equal to 1, while the replaced code fragment is checking if it is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the variable `a` is equal to 1, while the replaced code fragment is checking if it is equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the variable `a` is equal to 1, while the replaced code fragment is checking if `a + 1` is equal to 1.

DONE.
