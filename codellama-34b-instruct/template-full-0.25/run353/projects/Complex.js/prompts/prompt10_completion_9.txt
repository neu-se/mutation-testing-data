  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `x`, while this replacement would use the square of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the square root of `x`, while this replacement would use the square of `x` plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the square root of `x`, while this replacement would use the square of `x` minus one.

DONE.
