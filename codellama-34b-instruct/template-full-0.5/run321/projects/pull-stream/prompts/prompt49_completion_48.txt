  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction than the original code, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other iteration, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

DONE.
