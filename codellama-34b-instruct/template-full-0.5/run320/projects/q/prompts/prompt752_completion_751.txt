  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the rejection reason from `Error` to `null`, which could cause issues in the code that handles the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the rejection reason from `Error` to `undefined`, which could cause issues in the code that handles the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the rejection reason from an `Error` object to the string "rejected", which could cause issues in the code that handles the rejection.

DONE.
