  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function, which decodes a URI component, whereas the new code fragment uses the `toLowerCase` method, which converts a string to lowercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function, which decodes a URI component, whereas the new code fragment uses the `toLowerCase` method, which converts a string to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename` function, which returns the last component of a path, whereas the new code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function, which decodes a URI component.
