  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both equality and type, whereas the `!` operator only checks for equality. In this case, `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean, so using `===` would ensure that the value is both `false` and of type `boolean`, whereas `!` would only check for `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for both inequality and type, whereas the `!` operator only checks for inequality. In this case, `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean, so using `!==` would ensure that the value is both not `true` and not of type `boolean`, whereas `!` would only check for not `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections &&
