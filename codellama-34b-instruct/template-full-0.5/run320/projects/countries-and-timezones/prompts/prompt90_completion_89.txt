  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `getCountryForTimezone` would be `undefined`, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `getCountryForTimezone` would be an empty object, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'invalid', options
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `getCountryForTimezone` would be the string `'invalid'`, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of a country object.

DONE.
