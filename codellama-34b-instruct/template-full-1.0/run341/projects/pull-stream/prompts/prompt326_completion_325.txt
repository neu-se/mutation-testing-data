  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with an argument of `true`, which would cause it to set the `a` variable to `true` and call the `onEnd` function with a `null` value, regardless of whether the `read` function was called with an `end` value of `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with an argument of `false`, which would cause it to set the `a` variable to `false` and not call the `onEnd` function, regardless of whether the `read` function was called with an `end` value of `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called with an argument of `null`, which
