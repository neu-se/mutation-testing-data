 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|indice/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second alternative of the regular expression from "index" to "indice", which is not the correct plural form of the word in English.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|index|testis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new alternative "testis" to the regular expression, which is a Latin word that does not follow the English pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/appendix|index|testis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new alternative "crisis" to the regular expression, which is an English word that has a unique plural form "crises" and should be handled by a separate rule.

DONE.
