  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong substring for words ending with -ix, such as formix.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong substring for words ending with -ex, such as monstros.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the substring at the wrong index, such as for the word index.

DONE.
