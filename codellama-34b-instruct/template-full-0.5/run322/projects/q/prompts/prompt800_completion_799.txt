  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with the context of `this` bound to it, which would cause the promise chain to be resolved with a different value than what was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with the context of `null` bound to it, which would cause the promise chain to be resolved with a different value than what was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with the context of `undefined` bound to it, which would cause the promise chain to be resolved with a different value than what was intended.

DONE.
