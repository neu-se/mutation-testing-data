  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name) {
  return {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and the original code would return a timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name) {
  return data.timezones[name][0];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the _first_ timezone with the given name, while this modified code would return a random timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name) {
  return data.timezones[name] && Object.keys(data.timezones[name])[0];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the _first_ timezone with the given name, while this modified code would return a random key from the timezone object.

DONE.
