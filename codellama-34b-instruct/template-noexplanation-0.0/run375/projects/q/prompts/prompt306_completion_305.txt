  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < answerPs.length
```
This code fragment is a correct replacement for the original code fragment, as it iterates over the `answerPs` array and checks if the current index `i` is less than its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= answerPs.length
```
This code fragment is a correct replacement for the original code fragment, as it iterates over the `answerPs` array and checks if the current index `i` is less than or equal to its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= answerPs.length
```
This code fragment is a correct replacement for the original code fragment, as it iterates over the `answerPs` array and checks if the current index `i` is greater than or equal to its length.

DONE.
