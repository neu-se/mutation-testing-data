  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `allSettled` method to return a promise for an array of settled promises, rather than a promise for the original array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function always returns `true`, so the resulting array would be identical to the original array of promises. However, this change would still cause the `allSettled` method to return a promise for an array of settled promises, rather than a promise for the original array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function() { return Q.resolve(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map
