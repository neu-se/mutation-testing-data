  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate as `ended || (!end)` instead of `ended && !end`. This could potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` more often than it should, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` and `ended` are not the same variable, and the `!=` operator will always be `false` if they are different values. This could cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not `true`, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` and `test(data)` are not the same variable, and the `&&
