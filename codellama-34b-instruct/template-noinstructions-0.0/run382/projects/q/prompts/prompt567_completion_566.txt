  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise, and `result.value` is the fulfilled value of that promise. In the original code, `result` is returned directly, which means that the promise is returned instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function. In the original code, the callback function returns `result`, which is a promise, so the new promise would be resolved with the original promise instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function (value) { return value.value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function. In the original code,
