  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the buffer is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the buffer is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the length of the buffer is not equal to 0.

DONE.
