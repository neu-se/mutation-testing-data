  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context, whereas `call` and `apply` call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` sets the context of the function to `null`, whereas `call` and `apply` use the context of the function as it was defined.

DONE.
