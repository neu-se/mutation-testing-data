  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the value of `aborted`, but this replacement code unconditionally calls `cb(null)` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb(aborted)` only if `aborted` is truthy, but this replacement code unconditionally calls `abortCb(aborted)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `cb(null)` if `aborted` is falsy, but this replacement code calls `cb(abort)` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

DONE.
