  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the `matches` method to return `true` even if the path does not match the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` even if the path matches the regex.

DONE.
