  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined` and could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because wrapping `args` in an extra array would change the way the arguments are passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, _]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not the same as `_` and could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
