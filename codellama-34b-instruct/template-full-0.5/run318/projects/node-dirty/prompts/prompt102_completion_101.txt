  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the data object, while this code sets the value associated with the key to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the data object, while this code sets the value associated with the key to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code deletes the key from the data object, while this code sets the value associated with the key to an empty string.

DONE.
