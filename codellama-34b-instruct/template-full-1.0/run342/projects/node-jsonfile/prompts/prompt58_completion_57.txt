  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `\n` is a line feed character, while `"\\n"` is a string containing the characters `\` and `n`. This change would result in the JSON string not being properly formatted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `\n` is a line feed character, while `" "` is a space character. This change would result in the JSON string not being properly formatted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `\n` is a line feed character, while `"\0"` is a null character. This change would result in the JSON string not being properly formatted.

DONE.
