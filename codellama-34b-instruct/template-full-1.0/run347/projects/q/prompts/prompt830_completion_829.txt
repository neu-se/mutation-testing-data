  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a string, while `this` refers to a Promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because `1234` is a number, while `this` refers to a Promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is falsy, while `this` refers to a Promise object, which is truthy.

DONE.
