  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the reason "Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined" instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the reason "Cannot read property 'apply' of null" instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the reason "Cannot read property 'apply' of 'test'" instead of the original value.

DONE.
