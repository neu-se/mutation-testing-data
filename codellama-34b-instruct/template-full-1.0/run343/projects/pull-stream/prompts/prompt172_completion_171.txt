  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `array` variable to be treated as an array instead of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Object.isArray()` function instead of the `Array.isArray()` function, which would return a different result if the `array` variable is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `instanceof` operator instead of the `Array.isArray()` function to check if `array` is an array.

DONE.
