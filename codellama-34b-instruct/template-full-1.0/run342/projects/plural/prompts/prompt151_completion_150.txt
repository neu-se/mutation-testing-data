  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
that
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `that` refers to the current block scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `null` is a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of any other value.

DONE.
