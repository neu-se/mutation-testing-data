Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.active)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include policies that are marked as active, potentially omitting some policies that should be included in the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => { acc[policy.name] = policy; return acc; }, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an object instead of a Map, which would not have the same methods and properties as a `PolicyMap`, leading to runtime errors when trying to use Map-specific methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.id, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `policy.id` instead of `policy.name` as the key in the Map, which could lead to incorrect associations between policy names and their corresponding policy objects.

DONE.
