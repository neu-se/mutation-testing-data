  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1, otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to peek at the next operation in the delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1, otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to peek at the previous operation in the delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2, otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to peek at twice the length of the current operation in the delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
