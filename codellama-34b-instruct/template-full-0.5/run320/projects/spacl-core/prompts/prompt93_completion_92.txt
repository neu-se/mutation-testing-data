  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.delete` would remove the policy from the map, whereas `this.set` would update the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.clear` would remove all policies from the map, whereas `this.set` would update a specific policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy to the same name, whereas `this.set` would update the policy with a new name.

DONE.
