  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is not an object, instead of checking if it's a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is falsy, instead of checking if it's a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is undefined, instead of checking if it's a function.

DONE.
