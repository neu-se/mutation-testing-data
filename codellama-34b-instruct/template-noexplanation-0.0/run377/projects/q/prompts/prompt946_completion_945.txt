  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.promise)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to be called with the `promise` property of the `deferred` object as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
