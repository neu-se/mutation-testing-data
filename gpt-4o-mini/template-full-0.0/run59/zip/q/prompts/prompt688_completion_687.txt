Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the arguments passed to `array_slice`, potentially omitting the first argument instead of including it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invoke("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a different method (`invoke`) instead of `dispatch`, which may not exist or behave differently, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [null, array_slice(arguments)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `null` instead of `void 0`, which changes the first argument passed to the `dispatch` method, potentially altering how the method processes the call.

DONE.
