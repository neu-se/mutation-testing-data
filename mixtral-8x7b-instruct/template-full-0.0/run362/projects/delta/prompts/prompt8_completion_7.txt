 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with `undefined`, which would exclude values that are null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key in attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the key in the `attributes` object, rather than checking the value of the specific key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes.hasOwnProperty(key)
