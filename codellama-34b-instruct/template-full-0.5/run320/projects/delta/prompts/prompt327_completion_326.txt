  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire baseOp instead of just the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire baseOp instead of just the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp), { 'delete': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire baseOp and also set the 'delete' attribute to true.

DONE.
