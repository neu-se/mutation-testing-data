Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream || typeof stream === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is truthy or if it is a string, which would allow non-object types (like strings) to pass through, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is truthy and also verifies if it is a function, which would prevent valid object streams from being processed correctly, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!stream || typeof stream === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is falsy or if it is an object, which would incorrectly allow falsy values (like `null` or `undefined`) to be treated as valid streams, potentially causing runtime errors.

DONE.
