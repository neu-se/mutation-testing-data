  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the function to return the opposite value of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the sine instead of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the tangent instead of the cosine.

DONE.
