  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is less than 0. This change would cause the `log` method to return a different value when `a` is negative, which could lead to incorrect results in subsequent calculations.

DONE.
