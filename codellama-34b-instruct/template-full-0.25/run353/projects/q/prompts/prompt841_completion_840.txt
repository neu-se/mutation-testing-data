  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `void 0` as its first argument, which is likely not what the author intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and cannot be called, so the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and cannot be called, so the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called at all.

DONE.
