  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of `op.retain` to be a number, but the new code fragment checks for it to be a string. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `op.retain` is a number, even if `op.attributes` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `op.attributes` to be `null`, but the new code fragment checks for it to be not `null`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `op.attributes` is not `null`, even if `op.retain` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' || op.
