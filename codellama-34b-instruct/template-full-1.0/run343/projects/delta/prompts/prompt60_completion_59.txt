  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg === ''` would return `true` for both `''` and `' '`, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would only return `true` for `''`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof arg === 'number'` would return `true` for a number argument, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would only return `true` for a string argument that has length `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === '  '
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg === '  '` would return `true` for a string argument that has length `2`, while `typeof arg === 'string' && arg.length === 0` would only return `true` for a string argument that has length `0
