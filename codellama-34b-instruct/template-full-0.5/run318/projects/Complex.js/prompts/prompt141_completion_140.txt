  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, causing the code to execute the `return Complex['NAN'];` statement even if the base is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the base is NaN, and if so, it would return NaN, even if the base is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both the base and the exponent are infinite, and if so, it would return NaN, even if the base is not infinite.

DONE.
