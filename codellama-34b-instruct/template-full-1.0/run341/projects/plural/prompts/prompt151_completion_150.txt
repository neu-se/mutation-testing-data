  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the "this" keyword, which refers to the object that the method is called on. In contrast, "null" is a primitive value that references a null object. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the "this" keyword, which refers to the object that the method is called on. In contrast, "undefined" is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized variable or a nonexistent property. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the "this" keyword, which refers to the object that the method is called on. In contrast, "{}" is an empty JavaScript object, which is treated as a truthy value and is not a reference to any specific instance of a string. 

DONE.
