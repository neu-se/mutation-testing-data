  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` expects a function as its first argument, but `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(function() { return <PLACEHOLDER>; });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` expects a function that returns a promise, but the function returned by `<PLACEHOLDER>` does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(function() { return Q(<PLACEHOLDER>); });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` expects a function that returns a promise, and the function returned by `<PLACEHOLDER>` returns a promise that resolves to `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

DONE.
