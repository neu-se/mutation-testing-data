  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a non-empty retain operation, which could affect the inserts and deletes operations in the delta.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a delete operation, which could affect the length of the delta and the inserts operations.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat(other);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the two deltas, which could result in an entirely different set of operations and attributes.

DONE.
