  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` term would be added to the result of `Math.cos`, effectively multiplying it by `1/sqrt(2)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are complementary trigonometric functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` would be subtracted from the result of `Math.cos`, effectively multiplying it by `-1`.

DONE.
