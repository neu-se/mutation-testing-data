  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.get()` method is being called on the `tail` property instead of the `head` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.get()` method is being called on the `tail` property of the `head` object, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.get()` method is being called on `null` instead of the `head` property.

DONE.
