  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator flips the boolean value of `value`, potentially causing the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `value`, potentially causing the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[0]` operation would access the first element of `value`, potentially causing the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` when it should return `true`.

DONE.
