  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options || null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `options || null` would always evaluate to `null`, causing the `JSON.parse()` function to fail if `options` is falsy. In contrast, the original code fragment `data, options ? options.reviver : null` would only return `null` if `options` is falsy and `options.reviver` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `options ? options : null` would always return `null` if `options` is falsy, causing the `JSON.parse()` function to fail if `options` is falsy. In contrast, the original code fragment `data, options ? options.reviver : null` would only return `null` if `options` is falsy and `options.reviver` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
