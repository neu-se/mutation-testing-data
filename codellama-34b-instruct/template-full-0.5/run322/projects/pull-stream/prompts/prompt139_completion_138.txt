  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer the same as the `end` argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would no longer be called with an error as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a different error message.

DONE.
