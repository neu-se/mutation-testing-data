  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object with the parsed URL, while `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a new URL object that is the result of resolving a relative URL against a base URL, while `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.toString` returns a string representing the URL, while `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL in a specific format.

DONE.
