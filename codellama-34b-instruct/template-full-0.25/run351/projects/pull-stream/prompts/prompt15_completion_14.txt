  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === undefined` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `args` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment `args == null` would evaluate to `true` if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length === 0` would check if the `args` array has a length of 0, whereas the original code fragment `args == null` would check if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!args.length` would check if the `args` array has a length of 0, whereas the original code fragment `args == null` would check if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.
