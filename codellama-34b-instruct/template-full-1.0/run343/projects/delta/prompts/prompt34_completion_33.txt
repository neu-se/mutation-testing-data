  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is null or undefined. If `a` is null, the replacement would result in a different outcome than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== { 1: 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` is not the object `{ 1: 2 }`. If `a` is not the same object, the replacement would result in a different outcome than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.prototype.hasOwnProperty('constructor')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `a` has its own constructor property. If `a` has its
