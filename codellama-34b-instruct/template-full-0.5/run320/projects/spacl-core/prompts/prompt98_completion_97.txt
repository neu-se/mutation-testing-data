  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the policy name to be converted to lowercase, which could potentially match a different policy in the collection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the policy name to be reversed, which could potentially match a different policy in the collection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the policy name to be replaced with its length, which could potentially match a different policy in the collection.

DONE.
