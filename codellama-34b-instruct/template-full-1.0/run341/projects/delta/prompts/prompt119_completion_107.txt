  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem && (elem.insert || elem.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem` object may not have an `insert` or `delete` property, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem && (elem.insert === true || elem.delete === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` and `delete` properties may not be `true`, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem && (elem.insert || elem.delete) && (elem.insert.length || elem.delete.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` and `delete` properties may be `undefined`, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
