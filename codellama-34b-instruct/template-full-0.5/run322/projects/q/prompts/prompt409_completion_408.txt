  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would modify the value of `value`, potentially causing the `isPromise` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the number of characters in the string representation of `value`, potentially causing the `isPromise` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return a new string with all characters in uppercase, potentially causing the `isPromise` function to return a different result.

DONE.
