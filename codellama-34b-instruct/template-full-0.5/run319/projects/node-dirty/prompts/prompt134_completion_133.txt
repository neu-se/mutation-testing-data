  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` variable as a string, while the mutated code fragment is incrementing the `key` variable as a number. This could cause the code to behave differently when the `key` variable is used as an index for the `_data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` variable as a string, while the mutated code fragment is adding 1 to the `key` variable as a number. This could cause the code to behave differently when the `key` variable is used as an index for the `_data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `key` variable as a string, while the mutated code fragment is using the `null` value. This could cause the code
