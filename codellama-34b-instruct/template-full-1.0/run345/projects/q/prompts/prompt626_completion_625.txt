  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` operator would make the function return `undefined`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("boom!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the function to throw an error, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would return the `dispatch` method without calling it, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
