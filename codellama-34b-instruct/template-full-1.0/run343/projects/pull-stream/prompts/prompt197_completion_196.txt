  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because `busy` is always true when the code enters the `map` function, so the `read` function will never be called with `abort` set to `true`, even if the `abort` option is set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because `!busy` is always false when the code enters the `map` function, so the `read` function will always be called with `abort` set to `false`, even if the `abort` option is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is always true, so the `read` function will always be called with `abort` set to `true`, even if the `abort` option is not set.

DONE.
