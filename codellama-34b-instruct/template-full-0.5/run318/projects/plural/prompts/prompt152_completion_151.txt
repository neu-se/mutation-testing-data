  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the input number, which would cause the plural function to return a different output for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the input number, which would cause the plural function to return a different output for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the input number, which would cause the plural function to return a different output for some inputs.

DONE.
