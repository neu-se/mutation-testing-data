  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `send` method instead of the `post` method, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method instead of the `post` method, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method instead of the `post` method, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
