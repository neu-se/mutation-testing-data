Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the provided `object`, bypassing any timeout logic that was originally intended in the `Q.timeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the provided `object`, which is contrary to the original intention of resolving the promise if it is fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, function() { return "Error"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the rejection handling to return a string "Error" instead of propagating the original error, which alters the error handling mechanism of the promise.

DONE.
