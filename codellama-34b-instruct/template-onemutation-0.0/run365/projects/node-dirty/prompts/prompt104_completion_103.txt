  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from a map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key-value pair in a map. Using `delete` instead of `set` would cause the `update` method to remove the key-value pair from the map instead of updating it, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
