  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestTick` function immediately, rather than waiting for the `flushing` variable to be set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, rather than immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.apply(null, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestTick` function with an empty array as its context and argument, rather than with no arguments.

DONE.
