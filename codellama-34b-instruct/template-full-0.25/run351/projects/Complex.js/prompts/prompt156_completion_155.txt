  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['ZERO']` when both the dividend and divisor are zero.

DONE.
