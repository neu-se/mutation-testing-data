  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, which would cause the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `false` and the `fulfill` function to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with the value `true` instead of the original value, which would cause the `isPromiseAlike` function to return `true` and the `fulfill` function to be called instead.

```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, false);
