  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this
```
This would result in incorrect behavior because `this` could refer to any object that is not an array, causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= this
```
This would result in incorrect behavior because `index` could be less than or equal to `this`, causing the function to return a value that is not the next element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]
```
This would result in incorrect behavior because `this[index]` could refer to any value in the array, rather than the next element, causing the function to return a value that is not the next element in the array.

DONE.
