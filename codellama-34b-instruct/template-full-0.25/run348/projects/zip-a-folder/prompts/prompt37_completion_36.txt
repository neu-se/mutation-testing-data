  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` parameter is a glob, the function would return `false`, and if it's not a glob, it would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && src.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate the second operand if the first operand is truthy, so if `src` is not a glob, the function would return `false`, and if it is a glob, it would return `true` only if the length of `src` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || src.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate both operands and return
