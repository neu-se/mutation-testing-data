Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow negative lengths to be processed, which is not intended, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow zero-length retains to be processed, which would contradict the original intention of ignoring non-positive lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow a length of zero to be processed, ignoring any positive lengths, which would change the expected functionality of the retain method.

DONE.
