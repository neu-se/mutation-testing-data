  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would not be called with the correct `reason` argument, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would not be called with the correct `reason` argument, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called with a string value instead of the expected `reason` object, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
