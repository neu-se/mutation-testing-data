  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while this new code fragment returns the reason as a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while this new code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while this new code fragment returns null.

DONE.
