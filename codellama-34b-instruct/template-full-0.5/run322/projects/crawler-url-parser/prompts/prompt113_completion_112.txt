  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys in the map, which are the URLs in this case. The `values()` method, on the other hand, returns an iterator over the values in the map, which are the objects with the URL and text properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, which are the URLs and objects in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.forEach((url, currentUrl) => console.log(currentUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach()` method iterates over the key-value pairs in the map and executes the callback function for each pair. In this case, the callback function logs the current URL to the console.

DONE.
