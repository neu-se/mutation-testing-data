  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but the code is using `peekLength() - 1` which would result in skipping the last operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but the code is using `peekLength() + 1` which would result in including an extra operation in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but the code is using `peekLength() * 2` which would result in including twice as many operations in
