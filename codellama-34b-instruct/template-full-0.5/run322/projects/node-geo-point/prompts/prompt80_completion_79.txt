  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be offset by 360 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be offset by -360 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
