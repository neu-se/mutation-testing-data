  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This change will cause the `nfbind` method to always resolve the promise, even if the original function throws an error. This can be useful for testing the error handling of the code that uses the `nfbind` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `nfbind` method to return a promise that is never resolved or rejected. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the code that uses the `nfbind` method when it is passed a function that never returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This change will cause the `nfbind` method to throw an error when it is called. This can be useful for testing the error handling of the code that uses the `nfbind` method.

DONE.
