  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` parameter would be passed as `undefined`, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on `thisp` being a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, value, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid object, and would cause the code to fail if it relies on `thisp` being a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, value, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which could cause the code to behave differently if it relies on `thisp` being a specific object.

DONE.
