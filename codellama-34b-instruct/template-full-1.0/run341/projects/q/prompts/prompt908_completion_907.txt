  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing `arguments` with `0` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` because `0` is not an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a falsy value, which means that it would evaluate to `false` in a boolean context. In the original code, the `arguments` object is used in a boolean context to check whether any arguments were passed to the function. Replacing `arguments` with `void 0` would cause the code to think that no arguments were passed, even if they were.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which means
