  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this._queue` to `cbs` instead of adding `cbs` to the existing value of `this._queue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this._queue` to an empty array instead of adding `cbs` to the existing value of `this._queue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `this._queue` to a shallow copy of `cbs` instead of adding `cbs` to the existing value of `this._queue`.

DONE.
