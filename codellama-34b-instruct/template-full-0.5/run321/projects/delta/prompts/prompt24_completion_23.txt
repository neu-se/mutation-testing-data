  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input. The original code fragment `b[key]` correctly accesses the property `key` of the object `b`, while `a[key]` accesses the property `key` of the object `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the input. The original code fragment `b[key]` correctly accesses the property `key` of the object `b`, while `null` is a falsy value that would not be considered a valid property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the input. The original code fragment `b[key]` correctly accesses
