  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved after a delay, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the state of the promise passed to it, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object.

DONE.
