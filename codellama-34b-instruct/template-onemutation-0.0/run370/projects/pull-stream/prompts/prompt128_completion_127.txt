  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always returns `true`, while the new code fragment `false` always returns `false`. This change would cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the function returning `true` for some inputs.

DONE.
