  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks only for equality, while the original code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for both inequality and undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks only for inequality, while the original code fragment also checks for undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both inequality and undefined values.

DONE.
