  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.filter(attr => attr !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any null values from the `attributes` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.map(attr => attr + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would add 1 to each attribute value, which could potentially change the behavior of the `compose` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.reduce((acc, attr) => acc + attr, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would sum up all the attribute values, which could potentially change the behavior of the `compose` function.

DONE.
