  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value to be incremented by 1, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value to be multiplied by 2, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value to be decremented by 1, which could potentially cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently.

DONE.
