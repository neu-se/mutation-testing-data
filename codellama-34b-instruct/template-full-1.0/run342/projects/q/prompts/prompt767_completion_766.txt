  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unhandled rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not throw an error, whereas this new code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, returns a promise that resolves to `undefined`, whereas this new code fragment returns `undefined` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `noop`, does not call `when` on the `promise`, whereas this new code fragment does.

DONE.
