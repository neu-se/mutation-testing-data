 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'setImmediate' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `setImmediate` property in the `window` object, rather than checking if it is a function. This could lead to different behavior in environments that do not have a global `setImmediate` object, or when `setImmediate` is defined as a non-function value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window.setImmediate === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the `setImmediate` property on the `window` object, rather than just checking if `setImmediate` is a function. This could lead to different behavior in environments that do not have a global `setImmediate` object, or when `setImmediate` is defined as a non-function value on the `window` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof global.setImmediate
