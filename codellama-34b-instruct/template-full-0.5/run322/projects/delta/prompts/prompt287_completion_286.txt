  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, if we replace it with `index > 0`, it would check if the index is positive, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, if we replace it with `index % 2 === 0`, it would check if the index is even, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, if we replace it with `index !=
