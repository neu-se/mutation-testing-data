  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as `x * x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as `x * x * x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x * x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the absolute value of `x`, which is not the same as `x * x * x * x`.

DONE.
