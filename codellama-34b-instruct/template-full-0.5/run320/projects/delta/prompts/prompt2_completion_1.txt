  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object using the `typeof` operator, while this replacement checks if `b` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object using the `typeof` operator, while this replacement checks if `b` is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, NaN, 0, or an empty string).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object using the `typeof` operator, while this replacement checks if `b` is an instance of the `Object` constructor.

DONE.
