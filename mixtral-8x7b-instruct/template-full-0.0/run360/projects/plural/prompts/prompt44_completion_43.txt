 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last two characters of the word instead of the correct substring before the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the word instead of the correct substring before the last two characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string for words with a length greater than 2.

DONE.
