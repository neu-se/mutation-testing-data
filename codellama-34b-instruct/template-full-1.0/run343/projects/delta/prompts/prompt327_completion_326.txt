  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class and have different effects on the delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` have different effects on the delta object, and would potentially cause incorrect behavior in the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` have different effects on the delta object, and would potentially cause incorrect behavior in the `invert` method.

DONE.
