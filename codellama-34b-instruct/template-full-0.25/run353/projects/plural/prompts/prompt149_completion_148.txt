  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `plural` method is undefined, while this code checks if it's null. If the `plural` method is null, the code would throw an error instead of adding the method to the String prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === 'plural'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `plural` method is undefined, while this code checks if it's a string with the value 'plural'. If the `plural` method is a string, the code would throw an error instead of adding the method to the String prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `plural` method is undefined, while this code checks if it's a function
