  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because using an empty object instead of the `options` parameter would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an empty object instead of the expected object with country data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of the `options` parameter would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return `null` instead of the expected object with country data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the `options` parameter would cause the `getAllCountries` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected object with country data.

DONE.
