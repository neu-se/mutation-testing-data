  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `query` method to concatenate the `path` and `verb` strings instead of passing them as separate arguments to the `policy.query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.path` property is used instead of the `path` argument, which would cause the `query` method to use the `path` property of the `ctx` object instead of the `path` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.verb` property is used instead of the `verb` argument, which would cause the `query` method to use the `verb` property of the `ctx` object instead of the `verb` argument
