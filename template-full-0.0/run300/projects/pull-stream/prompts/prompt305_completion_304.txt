  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended, cb` is a comma operator that evaluates both `ended` and `cb` and returns the value of `cb`. In contrast, `ended && cb` is a logical AND operator that returns `cb` only if `ended` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended, cb` is a comma operator that evaluates both `ended` and `cb` and returns the value of `cb`. In contrast, `ended || cb` is a logical OR operator that returns `cb` only if `ended` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended, cb` is a comma operator that evaluates both `ended` and `cb` and returns the value of `cb`.
