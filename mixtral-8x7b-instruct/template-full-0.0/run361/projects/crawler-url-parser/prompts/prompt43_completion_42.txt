 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedBaseUrl` would not be overridden by `baseUrl` when it is defined, leading to potential misinterpretation of relative URLs in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` would include the query parameters as an object instead of a string, potentially causing issues in further processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl` would not include the query string, causing the `querycount` property to always be 0 and potentially affecting the logic in the `extract` function.

DONE.
