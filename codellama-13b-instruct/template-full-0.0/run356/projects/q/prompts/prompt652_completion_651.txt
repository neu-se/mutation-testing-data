  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different argument, resulting in a different array being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different argument, resulting in a different array being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different argument, resulting in a different array being passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
