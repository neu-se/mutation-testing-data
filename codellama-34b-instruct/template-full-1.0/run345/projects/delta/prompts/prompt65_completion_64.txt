  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the `arg` variable to the `insert` property of the `newOp` object, while this option assigns `null` to `insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have a `delete` property in the `newOp` object, while this option adds a `delete` property with a value of `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { insert: arg, attributes: { color: 'red' } };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not add an `attributes` property to the `newOp` object, while this option adds an `attributes` property with a value of `{ color: 'red' }`.

DONE.
