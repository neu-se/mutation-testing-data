 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<GeoPoint>[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method now expects an array of `GeoPoint` objects instead of a single `GeoPoint`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r) * 6371392.896
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method now calculates the distance using the same formula as the `calculateDistance` method, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.calculateDistance(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method now calculates the bearing based on the distance between the current object and the `point` parameter, instead of using the longitude difference between the two points.

DONE.
