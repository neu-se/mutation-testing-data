  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because previously the `fulfilled` callback function was passed as an argument to `spread`, but now the `rejected` callback function has been passed instead, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `not_fulfilled` callback function is passed as an argument to `spread`, but it has not been defined in the code, so it will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anything_else
```
This would result in different behavior because now any argument can be passed to `spread`, but the code does not handle any other method besides `fulfilled` and `rejected`, so it will result in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
