  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <new resolved promise>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new resolved promise instead of the original promise, which may not be desirable in some scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <new rejected promise>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new rejected promise instead of the original promise, which may not be desirable in some scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <new pending promise>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new pending promise instead of the original promise, which may not be desirable in some scenarios.

DONE.
