Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the current iterator (`thisIter`) instead of the length of the other iterator (`otherIter`), potentially leading to incorrect operations being performed on the deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length by 1, which could lead to an attempt to process one extra operation than available in `otherIter`, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the operation length to zero, effectively skipping any operations from `otherIter`, which could lead to missing important changes in the delta computation.

DONE.
