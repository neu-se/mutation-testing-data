  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, if `otherOp.retain` is not a number, the `if` statement would be skipped, while in this modified version, if `otherOp.retain` is not a number, the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, if `otherOp.retain` is an object, the `if` statement would be executed, while in this modified version, if `otherOp.retain` is an object, the `if` statement would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, if `otherOp.retain` is a boolean, the `if`
