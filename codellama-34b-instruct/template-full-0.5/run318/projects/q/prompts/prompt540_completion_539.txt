  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function is called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `all()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `all()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` function is called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `all()` method.

DONE.
