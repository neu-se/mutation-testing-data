  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the string from the 2nd position instead of the 8th position and would return 5 characters instead of the original -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"slice()"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the slice() method on the object returned by toString() instead of slicing the string directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Object.prototype" <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the default slice() method from Object.prototype instead of the overwritten slice() method.
