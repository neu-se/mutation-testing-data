  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function. In this case, the callback function returns `null`, so the new promise would be resolved with `null`, which would cause the loop to exit early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function. In this case, the callback function throws an error, so the new promise would be rejected with the error, which would cause the loop to exit early.

var p = promise.then(function() { return promise; });
