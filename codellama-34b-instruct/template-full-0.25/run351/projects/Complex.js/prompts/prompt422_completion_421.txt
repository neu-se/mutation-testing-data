  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a / d, -b / d).acosh()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acosh` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a / d, -b / d).atanh()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atanh` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(a / d, -b / d).asinh()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asinh` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
