  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `0` is a numerical value that could potentially have different effects on the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || ["ABC"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `["ABC"]` is an array literal with a single string element, which could cause a type error or unexpected behavior if the code assumes that `places` is a number or a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object that could have unexpected properties or methods, which could cause unintended behavior if the code assumes that `places` is a number or a falsy value.

DONE.
