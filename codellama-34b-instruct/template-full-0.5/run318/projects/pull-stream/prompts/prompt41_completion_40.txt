  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is a different method than `pull.apply`, and it has a different signature. `pull.call` takes the context as the first argument, followed by the arguments to be passed to the function, while `pull.apply` takes the context as the first argument, followed by an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` returns a new function that, when called, will have the specified context and arguments. It does not immediately call the function like `pull.apply` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call(null, ref)` will call the `pull` function with the `null` context and an array of arguments, while `pull.apply(null, ref
