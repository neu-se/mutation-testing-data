  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be using the longitude and latitude of the `point` object instead of the `this` object, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be using the longitude and latitude of the `this` object instead of the `point` object, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
