  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `dispatch` method would be different, potentially causing a different method to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `dispatch` method would be different, potentially causing a different method to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `dispatch` method would be different, potentially causing a different method to be called.

DONE.
