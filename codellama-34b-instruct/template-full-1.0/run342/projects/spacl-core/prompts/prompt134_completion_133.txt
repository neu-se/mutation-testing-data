  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 for (const verb in this.verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because previously it was checking if the verb is in the `verbs` object, but now it is checking if the `verb` is in the `Rule` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of this.verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because previously it was checking if the `verb` is in the `verbs` object, but now it is checking if the `verb` is in the `Rule` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [verb, allowed] of Object.entries(this.verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because previously it was checking if the `verb` is in the `verbs` object, but now it is checking if the `verb` is in the `Rule` object and also checking if the value of the verb is allowed or not.
