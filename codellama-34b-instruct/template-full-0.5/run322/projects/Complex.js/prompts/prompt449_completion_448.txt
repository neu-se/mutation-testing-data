  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by the number of places, which is not the same as multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, which would change the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the result of multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, which would change the final result.

DONE.
