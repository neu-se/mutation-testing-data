  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `void 0` are not the same value, and using `null` instead of `void 0` would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` and `void 0` are not the same value, and using `undefined` instead of `void 0` would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `void 0` are not the same value, and using `null` instead of `void 0` would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
