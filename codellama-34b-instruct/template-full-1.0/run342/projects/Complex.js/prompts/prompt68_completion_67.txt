  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the Complex constructor function instead of calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of `a` and `b` instead of calling the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` (Not a Number) instead of calling the `parse` function.

DONE.
