  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, while the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method removes a portion of the array and replaces it with new elements, while the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array without modifying the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method creates a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
