  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a length of 0, which would not affect the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a length of 1, which would remove the last operation in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a length of -1, which would remove the first operation in the delta.

DONE.
