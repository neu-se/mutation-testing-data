  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `retain` properties of the two operations for equality, rather than checking if `otherOp.retain` is an object or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `retain` properties of the two operations for strict equality, rather than checking if `otherOp.retain` is an object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `thisOp.retain` is an object and not null, rather than checking if `otherOp.retain` is an object or not.

DONE.
