  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the original code used the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] > value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, whereas the original code used the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] < value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for less than, whereas the original code used the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

DONE.
