  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"process" in globalObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `in` checks if a property is in the prototype chain of an object, while `typeof` checks if a variable is of a certain type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(process) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a function that converts an object to a string, while `typeof` checks if a variable is of a certain type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() !== "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` is a function that converts an object to a string, while `typeof` checks if a variable is of a certain type.

DONE.
