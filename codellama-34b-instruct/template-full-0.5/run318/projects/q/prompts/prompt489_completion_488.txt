  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would not be called with the correct argument, leading to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(["dummy"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with a non-empty array, leading to unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(unhandledRejections);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with the same array that is being used to track unhandled rejections, leading to unintended consequences.

DONE.
