  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the variable `embedType` refer to a different variable, `a`, which may not have the same properties or methods as `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the variable `embedType` refer to the same variable, `b`, which may have the same properties or methods as `b` but may also have different ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the variable `embedType` refer to a completely different variable, `c`, which may have different properties or methods than `b`.

DONE.
