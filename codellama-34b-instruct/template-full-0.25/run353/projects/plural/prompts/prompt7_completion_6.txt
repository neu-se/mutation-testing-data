  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `addRule` function adds a new rule to the beginning of the `rules` array, so replacing `unshift` with `push` would cause the new rule to be added to the end of the array instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `addRule` function adds a new rule to the beginning of the `rules` array, so replacing `unshift` with `pop` would cause the new rule to be removed from the end of the array instead of being added to the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.
