  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over the first operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to visit each operation twice, potentially leading to unexpected side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to visit each operation one less time than it should, potentially leading to missed opportunities.

DONE.
