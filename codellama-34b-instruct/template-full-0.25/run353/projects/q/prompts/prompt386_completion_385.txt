  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it is not being called with the correct `this` value, which is the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it is not being called with the correct `this` value, which is the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it is not being called with the correct `this` value, which is the promise.

DONE.
