  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, which flips the boolean value of `rule.matches`. If the original code fragment returned `true`, the mutated code would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.doesNotMatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotMatch` is a hypothetical method that does not exist in the `Rule` class. If the original code fragment called `rule.matches`, the mutated code would throw a `TypeError` because `doesNotMatch` is not a valid method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a valid method in the `Rule` class, but it has a different signature than `matches`. If the original code fragment called `rule.matches`, the mutated code would throw a `TypeError` because the
