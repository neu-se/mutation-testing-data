  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be added to the array, which would change the length of the array and potentially cause issues with the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be added to the array, which would change the length of the array and potentially cause issues with the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` would be added to the array, which would change the length of the array and potentially cause issues with the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
