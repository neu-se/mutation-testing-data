  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text != text
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the URL is already in the map, regardless of the text, while this new code fragment additionally checks if the text is the same as the previously saved text for the URL. This would result in different behavior if the same URL is used multiple times in the HTML, but with different text, as only the first URL would be saved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrlStr) && urlMap.get(currentUrlStr).text != text
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the URL is already in the map, regardless of the text, while this new code fragment additionally checks if the text is the same as the previously saved text for the URL. This would result in different behavior if the same URL is used multiple times in the HTML, but with different text, as only the first URL would be saved
