  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `z` object, which may not have the same behavior as the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `a` object, which may not have the same behavior as the original object.

DONE.
