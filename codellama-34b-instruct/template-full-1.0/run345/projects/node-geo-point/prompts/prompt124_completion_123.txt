  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, point
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to fail because `null` does not have a `longitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to fail because `null` does not have a `latitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5, point
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to fail because `5` is not a valid `longitude` value.

DONE.
