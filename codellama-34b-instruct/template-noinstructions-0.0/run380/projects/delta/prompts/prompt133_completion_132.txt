  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the length of the op, but adding 1 to it would cause the `slice` method to include one more element than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the length of the op, but subtracting 1 from it would cause the `slice` method to exclude one element that it should include.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the length of the op, but multiplying it by 2 would cause the `slice` method to include twice as many elements as it should.

DONE.
