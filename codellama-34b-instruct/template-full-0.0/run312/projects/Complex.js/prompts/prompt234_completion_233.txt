  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is greater than 0. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is greater than 0. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a + b` is greater than 0. This would cause
