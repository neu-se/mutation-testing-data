  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function would be called with a different argument, which would affect the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function would be called with a different argument, which would affect the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function would be called with a different argument, which would affect the output of the function.

DONE.
