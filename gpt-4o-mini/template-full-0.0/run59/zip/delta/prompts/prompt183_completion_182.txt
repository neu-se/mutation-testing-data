Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the `retain` property from `thisOp` instead of `otherOp`, potentially leading to incorrect operations being pushed to the `delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `insert` property from `otherOp` instead of `otherOp.retain`, which could lead to inserting operations when a retain operation was expected, altering the intended composition logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the conditional block to be skipped entirely, which would prevent any new operations from being created and pushed to the `delta`.

DONE.
