  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array with one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with two elements, instead of an array with one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with one element, but the element would be the last element of the original array, instead of the first element.

DONE.
