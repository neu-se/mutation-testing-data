  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a, b * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the input to the `parse` function, which could cause it to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a + 1, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `a` would change the input to the `parse` function, which could cause it to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a * b, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` and `b` would change the input to the `parse` function, which could cause it to produce a different output.

DONE.
