  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? end : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, and if it is, it passes `null` to the `done` callback. However, the modified code fragment checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, and if it is, it passes `end` to the `done` callback. This could result in a different execution path if the `end` parameter is not strictly equal to `true`.
