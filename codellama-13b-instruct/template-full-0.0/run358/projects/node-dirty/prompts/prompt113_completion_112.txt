  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted immediately, without waiting for the file to be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with the number of items in the data set, rather than the number of bytes read from the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with the number of items in the data set plus one, rather than the number of bytes read from the file.

DONE.
