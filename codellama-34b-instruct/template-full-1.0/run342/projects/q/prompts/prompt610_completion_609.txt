  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(5).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(5)` is a resolved promise with the value `5`, rather than a promise that resolves to an object with a `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function(o) { return o.dispatch; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to chain an additional function that returns the `dispatch` method of the resolved object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).get("dispatch")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is used to retrieve the value of the `dispatch` property of the resolved object, rather than calling the `dispatch` method directly.

DONE.
