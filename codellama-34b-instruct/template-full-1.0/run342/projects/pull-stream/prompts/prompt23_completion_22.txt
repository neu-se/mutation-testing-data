  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the first element of the array `ref`, while the modified fragment returns a reference to the second element of the array `ref`, since the postfix increment operator (`++`) increments the value of `ref[0]` before returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the last element of the array `ref`, while the modified fragment returns a reference to the second-to-last element of the array `ref`, since the length of `ref` is subtracted by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a reference to the first element of the array `ref`, while the modified fragment returns a reference to the second element of the array `ref`, since the first
