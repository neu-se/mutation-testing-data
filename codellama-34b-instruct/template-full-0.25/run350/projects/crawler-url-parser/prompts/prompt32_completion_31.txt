  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a valid protocol, while 'https://' would result in the URL starting with a different protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include the 'www.' subdomain, while the modified code would include it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include the 'example.' domain, while the modified code would include it.

DONE.
