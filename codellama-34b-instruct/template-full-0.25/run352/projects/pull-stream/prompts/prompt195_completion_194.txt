  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. In the original code, the `aborted` variable is used to indicate whether the operation has been aborted, and the `null` value would not have the same meaning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value. In the original code, the `aborted` variable is used to indicate whether the operation has been aborted, and the `undefined` value would not have the same meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `false` is a boolean value that indicates that the operation has not been aborted
