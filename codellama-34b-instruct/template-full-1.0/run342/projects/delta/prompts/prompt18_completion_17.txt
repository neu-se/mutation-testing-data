  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the keys of both objects `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment only concatenates the keys of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).slice(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a slice of the keys of `a` based on the keys of `b`, whereas the original code fragment simply concatenates the keys of `b` to the keys of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => b[key] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the keys of `a` based on the keys of `b`, whereas the original code fragment simply concatenates all the keys of `b` to the keys of `a`.

DONE.
