  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma, which separates elements in an array, while the new code fragment is a semicolon, which is a statement separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'||'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma, which separates elements in an array, while the new code fragment is a logical OR operator, which evaluates to true if either of its operands is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comma, which separates elements in an array, while the new code fragment is a logical AND operator, which evaluates to true if both of its operands are true.

DONE.
