  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of a word, while this new code fragment returns the plural form of a word plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of a word, while this new code fragment returns the plural form of a word minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of a word, while this new code fragment returns the plural form of a word squared.

DONE.
