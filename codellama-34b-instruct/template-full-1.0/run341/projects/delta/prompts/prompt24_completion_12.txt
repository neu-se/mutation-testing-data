  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the value of `a` instead of `b`, which could lead to different results for the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] !== undefined ? b[key] : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of `b[key]` if `b[key]` is not defined, which could lead to different results for the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not equal using the `isEqual` function, which could lead to different results for the `diff` function.

DONE.
