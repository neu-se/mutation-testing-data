  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is an object and not null. This change would cause the `throw` statement to be executed if `a` is an object, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
