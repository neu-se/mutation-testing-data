  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last letter of the word, whereas the original code would remove the last two letters if the word ended in `is`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove all letters of the word, whereas the original code would remove the last two letters if the word ended in `is`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove all letters of the word except the last one, whereas the original code would remove the last two letters if the word ended in `is`.

DONE.
