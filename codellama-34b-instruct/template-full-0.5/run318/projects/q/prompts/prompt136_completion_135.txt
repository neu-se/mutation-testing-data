  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the exception is an instance of `QReturnValue`, while this new code fragment would always return false, even if the exception is an instance of `QReturnValue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the exception is an instance of `QReturnValue`, while this new code fragment would always return false, even if the exception is an instance of `QReturnValue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the exception is an instance of `QReturnValue`, while this new code fragment would always return false, even if the exception is an instance of `QReturnValue`.

DONE.
