  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks whether `a` is not equal to 0. This would cause the function to return a different value if `a` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks whether `a` is equal to 0 using the `==` operator. This would cause the function to return a different value if `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to 0, while this replacement checks whether `a` is not equal to 0 using the `!=` operator. This would cause the function to
