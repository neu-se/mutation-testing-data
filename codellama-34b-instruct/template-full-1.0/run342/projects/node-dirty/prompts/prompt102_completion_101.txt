  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would store the value `1` with the key `null`, potentially overwriting existing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method would remove all key-value pairs from the map, potentially invalidating the state of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would retrieve the value associated with the key `null`, potentially returning `undefined` or an incorrect value.

DONE.
