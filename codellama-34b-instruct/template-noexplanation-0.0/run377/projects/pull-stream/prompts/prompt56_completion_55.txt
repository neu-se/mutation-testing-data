  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop
```
This change will cause the `collect` function to remove the last element from the array instead of adding it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `collect` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This change will cause the `collect` function to remove the first element from the array instead of adding it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `collect` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift
```
This change will cause the `collect` function to add the element to the beginning of the array instead of the end, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `collect` function.

DONE.
