  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `invert` method to always return an empty delta, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This change will cause the `invert` method to always return a delta with a single retain operation, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'boolean'
```
This change will cause the `invert` method to always return a delta with a single retain operation, regardless of the input.

DONE.
