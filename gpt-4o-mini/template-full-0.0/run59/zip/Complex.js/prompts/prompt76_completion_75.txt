Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the loop to access an out-of-bounds index of the `tokens` array, potentially leading to an `undefined` value being processed, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the loop to one less than the actual length of the `tokens` array, causing the last token to be ignored and potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an infinite loop since the condition will always be false, preventing any iteration from occurring and effectively freezing the execution of the function.

DONE.
