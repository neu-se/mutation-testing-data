  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called with a starting index of 1, which would exclude the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called with a negative starting index, which would start from the end of the array instead of the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called with a negative ending index, which would exclude the last element of the array.

DONE.
