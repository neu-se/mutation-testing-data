  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property is null, whereas the original code fragment checks if it is an object that is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property is not an object, whereas the original code fragment checks if it is an object that is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `retain` property is not equal to 1, whereas the original code fragment checks if it is an object that is not null.

DONE.
