  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrlStr` variable as is, while the modified code converts it to lowercase before using it. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `baseUrlStr` variable contains uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrlStr` variable as is, while the modified code splits it into an array of substrings using the dot (`.`) character as a delimiter, and then selects the first element of the array. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `baseUrlStr` variable contains multiple subdomains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/\./g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrlStr` variable as is, while
