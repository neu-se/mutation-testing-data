  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip over some elements and not iterate over the entire list, which could cause the function to not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to stop iterating before reaching the end of the list, which could cause the function to not work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to iterate past the end of the list, which could cause the function to not work correctly.

DONE.
