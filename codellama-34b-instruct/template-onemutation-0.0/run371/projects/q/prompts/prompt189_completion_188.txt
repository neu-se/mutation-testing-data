  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` constructor is used to convert a value to a number, while the `String` constructor is used to convert a value to a string. In the original code, the `Number` constructor is used to convert the `attempt2[2]` to a number, which would result in a number being pushed to the `desiredLines` array. However, if the `String` constructor is used instead, the `attempt2[2]` would be converted to a string, which would result in a different value being pushed to the `desiredLines` array.
