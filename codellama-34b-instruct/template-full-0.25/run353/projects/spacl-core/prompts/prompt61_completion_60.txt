  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` variable is used to determine whether the path contains wildcards or not. By setting it to `false`, the code would not correctly identify paths with wildcards, leading to incorrect matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` and `max` variables are used to determine the minimum and maximum number of segments in the path. By setting `min` to `max`, the code would not correctly identify paths with a variable number of segments, leading to incorrect matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/[^/]+')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts` array is used to store the segments of the path. By pushing a new segment to the array, the code would not correctly identify the number of segments in the path, leading to incorrect matches.

DONE.
