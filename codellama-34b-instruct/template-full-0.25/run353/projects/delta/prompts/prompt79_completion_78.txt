  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `delete` property of `lastOp` is equal to the `insert` property of `newOp`, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is an object and `newOp` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === newOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `delete` property of `lastOp` is equal to the length of the `insert` property of `newOp`, which is not the same as checking if `lastOp` is an object and `newOp` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === newOp.insert.length && newOp.insert.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `delete` property of `lastOp` is
