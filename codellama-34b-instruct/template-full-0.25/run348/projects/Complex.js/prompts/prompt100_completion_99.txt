  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the real part of the complex number would be inverted, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number would be increased by 1, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number would be doubled, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
