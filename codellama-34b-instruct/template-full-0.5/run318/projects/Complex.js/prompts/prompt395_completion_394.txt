  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the sine function would be flipped, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would be replaced with the cosine function, causing the resulting complex number to have a different imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would be replaced with the tangent function, causing the resulting complex number to have a different real part and imaginary part.

DONE.
