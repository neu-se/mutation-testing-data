  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove the last reason from the array instead of the specific reason at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` would remove the first rejection from the array instead of the specific rejection at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at+1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the next reason from the array instead of the specific reason at the specified index.

DONE.
