  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that creates a new promise and immediately calls the function with the provided arguments, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the provided value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a new promise that is resolved with the provided value, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the provided value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a new promise that is rejected with the provided reason, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the provided value.

DONE.
