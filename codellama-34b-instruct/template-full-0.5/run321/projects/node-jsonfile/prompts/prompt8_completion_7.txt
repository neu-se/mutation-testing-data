  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that contains the contents of the file, while `stripBom` is a function that removes the byte order mark (BOM) from a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is a function that parses a JSON string and returns an object, while `stripBom` is a function that removes the BOM from a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.replace` is a function that replaces a substring in a string, while `stripBom` is a function that removes the BOM from a string.

DONE.
