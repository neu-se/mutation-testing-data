  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks) {
  exports[k] = sinks[k];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `sinks` object, rather than the `sources` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks) {
  exports[k] = sinks[k];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `sinks` object, rather than the `throughs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks) {
  exports[k] = sinks[k];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over the properties of the `sinks` object, rather than the `exports` object.

DONE.
