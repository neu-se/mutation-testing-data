  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now looking for a word boundary after the "a" instead of just checking for the letter "a" anywhere in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now looking for the letter "b" instead of the letter "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(a|b)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now looking for the letters "a" or "b" instead of just the letter "a".

DONE.
