  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(NEW_LENGTH);
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to `otherIter.next()` is now a different length, which could cause the iteration to skip or repeat over certain elements in the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.stepBack();
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would now be stepping backward through the operations, which could cause it to skip over certain elements or cause it to repeat over others.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.prev();
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would now be iterating through the operations in reverse order, which could cause it to skip over certain elements or cause it to repeat over others.

DONE.
