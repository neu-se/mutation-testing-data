Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat non-object types (like arrays or null) as valid, allowing the function to proceed with a potentially invalid `b` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `b` is strictly `null`, ignoring other non-object types (like numbers or strings) that should also trigger the same handling as non-objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow arrays to be treated as valid objects, which could lead to unexpected results when comparing attributes that are expected to be objects.

DONE.
