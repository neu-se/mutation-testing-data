  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a `RegExpMatchArray` object, and `undefined` is not a valid value for this type. The original code fragment checks whether `match` is `null`, which is a valid value for `RegExpMatchArray`. However, if `match` is `undefined`, the code will throw a `TypeError` when trying to access its `length` property.

DONE.
