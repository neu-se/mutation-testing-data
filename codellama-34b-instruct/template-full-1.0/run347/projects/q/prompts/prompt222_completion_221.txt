  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would catch the error and return a rejected promise, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return q.reject("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with the reason "test", which would not occur in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return q.resolve("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a resolved promise with the value "test", which would not occur in the original code.

DONE.
