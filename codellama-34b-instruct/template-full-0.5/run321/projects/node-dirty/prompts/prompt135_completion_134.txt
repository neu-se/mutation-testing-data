  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` converts a JavaScript object to a JSON string, while `JSON.parse` converts a JSON string to a JavaScript object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is a string, and `String(key)` would return the same string, which would be unnecessary and potentially confusing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is a string, and `key + ''` would return the same string, which would be unnecessary and potentially confusing.

DONE.
