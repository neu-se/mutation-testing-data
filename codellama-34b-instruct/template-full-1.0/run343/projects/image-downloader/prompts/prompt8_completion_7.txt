  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the destination path has an extension, while the modified code fragment checks whether the destination path does not have an extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for any extension, while the modified code fragment checks for a specific extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) !== path.extname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the destination extension is the same as the source extension, while the modified code fragment checks whether the destination extension is different from the source extension.

DONE.
