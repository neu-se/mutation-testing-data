  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[1]` is the second element of the `attempt3` array, whereas `attempt3[2]` is the third element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[0]` is the first element of the `attempt3` array, whereas `attempt3[2]` is the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3.length` is the number of elements in the `attempt3` array, whereas `attempt3[2]` is the third element.

DONE.
