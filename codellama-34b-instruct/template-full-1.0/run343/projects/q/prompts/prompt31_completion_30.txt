  Sure, I can provide you with three potential mutations of the code snippet you provided.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method takes an index as an argument, and `-1` is not a valid index. The code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element from the array, whereas `pop` removes the last element. The code would still work, but the behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a valid index for the `pop` method. The code would throw an error.

DONE.
