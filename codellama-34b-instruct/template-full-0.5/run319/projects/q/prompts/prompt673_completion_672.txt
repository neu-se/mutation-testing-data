  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fapply` function expects a function as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fapply` function expects a function as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fapply` function expects a function as its first argument, and passing an empty function would cause it to return a promise that is already resolved, rather than waiting for the original promise to settle.

DONE.
