  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the values at the given key are not the same, rather than checking if they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] || a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the values at the given key are not the same, or if the value in `a` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either the value in `a` or the value in `b` is undefined, rather than checking if they are not equal.

DONE.
