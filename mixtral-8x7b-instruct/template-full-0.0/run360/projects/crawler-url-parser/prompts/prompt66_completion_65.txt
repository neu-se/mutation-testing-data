 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.search.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the search string into individual characters instead of key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.search.split(null)
