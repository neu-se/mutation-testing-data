  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has a property with the given name. By using `call`, we are explicitly binding the `this` value of the function to the `object` argument, which ensures that the function is called with the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has a property with the given name, and it is a more robust way of checking for the existence of a property. By using `call`, we are explicitly binding the `this` value of the function to the `object` argument, which ensures that the function is called with the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
