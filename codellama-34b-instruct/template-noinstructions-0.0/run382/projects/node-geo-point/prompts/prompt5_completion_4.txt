  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point
```
This would result in different behavior because `!point` will always be truthy, even if `point` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `point` has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, but not if they are objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point === 'object' && point !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `point` is an object, but not if it has the properties `type` and `coordinates`.

DONE.
