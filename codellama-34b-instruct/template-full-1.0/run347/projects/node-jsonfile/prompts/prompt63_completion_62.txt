  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string, while the original code fragment returns the full string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method returns a new string with all characters in upper case, while the original code fragment returns the full string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings, while the original code fragment returns the full string.

DONE.
