  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be modified, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be modified, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be modified, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
