  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext && <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `&&` operator, which would cause the code to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() || <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `||` operator, which would cause the code to always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
