  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, causing the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress, fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
