  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different port number, which could cause the message to be sent to the wrong recipient.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the message sent through the `MessageChannel` would have a different type and value, which could cause the recipient to handle it differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a null port number, which could cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
