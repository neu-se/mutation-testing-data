  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(string.length - 1, string.length) === "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.substring(string.length - 1, string.length)` would return the last character of the string, while `string.endsWith("/")` would return a boolean indicating whether the string ends with "/".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(-1) === "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.slice(-1)` would return the last character of the string, while `string.endsWith("/")` would return a boolean indicating whether the string ends with "/".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because `string.includes("/")` would return a boolean indicating whether the string contains "/", while `string.endsWith("/")` would return a boolean indicating whether the string ends with "/".

DONE.
