  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `im` property of the `a` object, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `im` property of the `b` object, which is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_c
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `im` property of the `c` object, which is not defined.

DONE.
