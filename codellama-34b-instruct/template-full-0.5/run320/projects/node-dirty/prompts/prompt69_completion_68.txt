  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a different argument, which could cause any listeners to the `load` event to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with a different argument, which could cause any listeners to the `drain` event to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Intentional error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because an `error` event would be emitted with a custom error message, which could cause any listeners to the `error` event to behave differently.

DONE.
