  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three potential buggy code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code sample:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise with an error, while `Q` is the global object for the Q JS library and is not a function that can be called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout(1)` will reject the promise after one millisecond, while `Q` is the global object for the Q JS library and is not a function that can be called with a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` is a promise that is not linked to the original promise,
