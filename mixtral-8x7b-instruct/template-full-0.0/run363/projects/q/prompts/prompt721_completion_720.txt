 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would receive `null` as an argument instead of a deferred object, causing the `all` function to throw an exception when trying to access the `defer.promise` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` would receive an empty object instead of an array, causing the `all` function to reject the returned promise with an error indicating that the resolved value is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { deferred.resolve(value * 2); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value of the promise would be multiplied by 2, which could cause unexpected results in the code that uses the `all` function.

DONE.
