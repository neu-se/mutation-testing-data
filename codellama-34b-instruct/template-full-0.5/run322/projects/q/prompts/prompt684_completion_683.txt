  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first two arguments in the array slice, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument in the array slice, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first three arguments in the array slice, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
