  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 'foo'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different type of argument, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', {}); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different type of argument, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

DONE.
