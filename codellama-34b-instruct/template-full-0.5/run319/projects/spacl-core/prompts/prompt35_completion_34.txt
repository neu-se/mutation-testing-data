  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would concatenate the array elements with the `/` character, resulting in a different string than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would convert each array element to lowercase, resulting in a different string than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().filter(x => x.startsWith(':'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would only include array elements that start with the `:` character, resulting in a different string than the original code fragment.

DONE.
