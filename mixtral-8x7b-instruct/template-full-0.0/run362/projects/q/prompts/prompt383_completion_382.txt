 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => callback
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the callback in an arrow function, which may affect how 'this' is bound or how arguments are passed to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a default empty function as a second argument to the 'or' operator, which could cause the callback to not be called if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of 'this' inside the callback, which could cause unexpected behavior if the callback relies on the value of 'this' from the parent scope.

DONE.
