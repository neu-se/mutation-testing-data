  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of "http://" with "https://" in the base URL string, potentially changing the URL and potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http", "https")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of "http" with "https" in the base URL string, potentially changing the URL and potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." prefix from the base URL string, potentially changing the URL and potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
