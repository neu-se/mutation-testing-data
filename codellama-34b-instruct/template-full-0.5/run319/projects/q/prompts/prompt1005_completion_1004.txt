  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method `name` on the object `object`, rather than calling the `dispatch` method with the `post` event and the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch.call(object, "post", [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the object `object` with the `post` event and the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments, rather than calling the `dispatch` method with the `post` event and the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments on the `object` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch.apply(object, ["post", [name, nodeArgs]])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the object `object` with the `post`
