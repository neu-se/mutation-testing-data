  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the condition to always be false if `b` does not have the `arg` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && !('arg' in a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now negated, so it would only be true if `a` has the `abs` property but not the `arg` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in a && a.abs < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now includes an additional check for the value of `a.abs`, which would cause the condition to be false if `a.abs` is negative.

DONE.
