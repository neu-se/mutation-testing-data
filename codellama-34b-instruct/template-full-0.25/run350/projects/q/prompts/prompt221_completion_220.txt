  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object with the specified prototype, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `prototype` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object with the specified prototype, but `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `prototype` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a function that creates a new object with the specified prototype, but `{}` is an empty object literal that does not have a `prototype` property.

DONE.
