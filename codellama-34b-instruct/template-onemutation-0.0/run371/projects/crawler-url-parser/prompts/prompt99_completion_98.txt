  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the object has the specified property as a direct property, whereas `has` checks if the object has the specified property, either as a direct property or inherited from its prototype chain.
