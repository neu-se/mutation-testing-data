 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes only the `end` parameter to the callback, while the modified version passes both `end` and `data`. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` parameter to the callback, while the modified version passes a boolean value. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with a specific data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(test(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `end` parameter to the callback, while the modified version passes the result of the `test` function. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to be called with a specific value.
