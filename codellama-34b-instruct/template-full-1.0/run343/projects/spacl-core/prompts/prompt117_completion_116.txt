  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) || verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator would cause the rule to always return true if the path matches, regardless of whether the verb is allowed or denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && !(verb in this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator would cause the rule to always return false if the path matches and the verb is allowed, regardless of whether the verb is denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs[path]
```
This would result in different behavior because the [path] property would cause the rule to only apply to verbs that are allowed for the specific path, rather than all allowed verbs.

DONE.
