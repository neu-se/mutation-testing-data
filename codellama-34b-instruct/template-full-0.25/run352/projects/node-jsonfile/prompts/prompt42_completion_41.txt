  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `options.reviver` as the second argument to `stringify`, while the new code fragment uses `options` as the second argument. This could cause the JSON string to be generated differently, potentially leading to test failures if the tests are expecting a specific output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `options.encoding` as the second argument to `stringify`, while the new code fragment uses `options` as the second argument. This could cause the JSON string to be generated differently, potentially leading to test failures if the tests are expecting a specific output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options.throws)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `options.throws` as the second argument to
