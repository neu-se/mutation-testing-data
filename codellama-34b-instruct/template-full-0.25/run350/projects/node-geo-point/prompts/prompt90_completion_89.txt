  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is being applied to the wrong argument. In the original code, the `sin` function is applied to the `θ` argument, which is the bearing in radians. However, in this modified code, the `sin` function is applied to the `δ` argument, which is the angular distance in radians. This would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being applied to the wrong argument. In the original code, the `cos` function is applied to the `θ` argument, which is the bearing in radians.
