  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return defer.promise.then(
    function (value) {
        return fulfilled ? fulfilled(value) : value;
    },
    function (exception) {
        return rejected ? rejected(exception) : reject(exception);
    },
    function (value) {
        return progressed ? progressed(value) : value;
    }
);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.promise.then` method
is not guaranteed to be called with exactly three arguments, so the code would
not work correctly if there are fewer or more arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise.then(fulfilled, rejected, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.promise.then`
method is not guaranteed to be called with exactly three arguments, so the
code would not work correctly if there are fewer or more arguments passed to
the function.
