 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.callee
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.callee` is deprecated and may not be available in strict mode or in some environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of an array to `array_slice` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because using `eval` is generally considered bad practice and can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
