  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to consider the wrong type of operation when comparing the two strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to consider the wrong length of the current operation when comparing the two strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to consider the wrong length of the current operation in the other delta when comparing the two strings.

DONE.
