  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the imaginary part of `z` from the imaginary part of `this`, while this alternative code fragment adds them instead. This would cause the `equals` method to return `true` for two complex numbers that are not equal, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the imaginary part of `z` from the imaginary part of `this`, while this alternative code fragment multiplies them instead. This would cause the `equals` method to return `true` for two complex numbers that are not equal, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the
