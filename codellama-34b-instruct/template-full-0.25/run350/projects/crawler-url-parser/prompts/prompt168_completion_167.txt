  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, while `includes` returns a boolean value indicating whether the substring is present in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, while `includes` returns a boolean value indicating whether the substring is present in the string.

DONE.
