  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which means that the stream will not be closed properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which means that the stream will not be closed properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Intentional error')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown, which means that the stream will not be closed properly.

DONE.
