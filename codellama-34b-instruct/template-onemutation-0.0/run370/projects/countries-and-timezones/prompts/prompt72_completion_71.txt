  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `true` argument would cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a timezone object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which would not match the expected behavior of the original code.
