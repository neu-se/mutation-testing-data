  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is not called with any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called with `undefined` as an argument, which is not the same as not calling the method at all.

DONE.
