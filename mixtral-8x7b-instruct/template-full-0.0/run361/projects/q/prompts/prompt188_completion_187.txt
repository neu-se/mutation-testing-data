 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attempt2 || []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array when `attempt2` is falsy, instead of throwing an error when `attempt2` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attempt2 || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` when `attempt2` is falsy, instead of throwing an error when `attempt2` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attempt2 || false
