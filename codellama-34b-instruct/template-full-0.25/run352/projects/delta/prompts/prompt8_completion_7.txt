  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the value is exactly null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the value is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this new code fragment checks if the value is falsy.

DONE.
