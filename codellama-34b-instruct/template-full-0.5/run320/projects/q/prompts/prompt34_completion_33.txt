  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function and `task()` would call the function, whereas the original code simply refers to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function and `task + 1` would result in a TypeError, whereas the original code simply refers to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function and `task = 1` would overwrite the function with the value 1, whereas the original code simply refers to the function.

DONE.
