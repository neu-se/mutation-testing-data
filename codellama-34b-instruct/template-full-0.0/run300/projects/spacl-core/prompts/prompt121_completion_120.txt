  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `true` for any path that matches the regular expression, regardless of whether the path is governed by the rule or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex) && ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `true` only if the path matches the regular expression and the query context is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex) && ctx !== undefined && ctx.props.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `true` only if the path matches the regular expression, the query context is not undefined, and the query context has at least one property.

DONE.
