 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 're' property of the newly created Complex object would always be 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because the 're' property of the newly created Complex object would always be set to the 're' property of the current Complex object, instead of the parsed value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the 're' property of the newly created Complex object would be set to a random value, instead of the parsed value.

DONE.
