  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. The original code fragment calls `cb` with `end` as the first argument, which is the correct behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `err` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. The original code fragment calls `cb` with `end` as the first argument, which is the correct behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as both arguments, which is not the expected behavior. The original code fragment calls `cb` with `end` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which
