  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with the string "foo", rather than the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with the number 2, rather than the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ bar: "baz" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with an object with a `bar` property, rather than the promise object.

DONE.
