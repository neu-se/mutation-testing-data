  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key-value pair from the queue, whereas the original code fragment would set the value of the key to an empty list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method would remove all key-value pairs from the queue, whereas the original code fragment would set the value of the key to an empty list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value of the key to an empty list, whereas the original code fragment would remove the key-value pair from the queue.

DONE.
