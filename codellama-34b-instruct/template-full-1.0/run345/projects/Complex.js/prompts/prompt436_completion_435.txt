  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places++ || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment guarantees that `places` will be `0` if it is `undefined`, whereas the modified code fragment will still increment `places` even if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment guarantees that `places` will be positive or `0`, whereas the modified code fragment will always return a negative number or `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(places) || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rounds `places` to the nearest integer, whereas the modified code fragment will always return the floor of `places`.

DONE.
