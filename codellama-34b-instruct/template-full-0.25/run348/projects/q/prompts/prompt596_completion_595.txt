  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument of the `args` array, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], self
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `args` array as the `this` context, instead of passing the original `self` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first two arguments of the `args` array, instead of passing all the arguments.

DONE.
