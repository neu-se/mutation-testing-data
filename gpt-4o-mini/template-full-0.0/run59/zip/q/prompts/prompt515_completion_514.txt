Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a valid executor function to `defer` would likely cause the promise to be in a pending state indefinitely, as there would be no way to resolve or reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a number instead of a function to `defer` would not execute any promise resolution logic, leading to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to use the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(() => { throw new Error("Forced error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the executor function immediately throws an error, causing the promise to be rejected right away, which is different from the original behavior where the promise would be resolved based on the provided `promise` argument.

DONE.
