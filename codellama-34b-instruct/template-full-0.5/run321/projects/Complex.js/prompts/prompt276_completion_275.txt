  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by 1, which could lead to errors in the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be twice as large, which could lead to errors in the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result to be off by 1, which could lead to errors in the calculation of the complex exponent.

DONE.
