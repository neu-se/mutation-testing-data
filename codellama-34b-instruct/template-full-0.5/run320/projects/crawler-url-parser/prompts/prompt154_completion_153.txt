  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that is not a forward slash, followed by a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the sequence of characters is preceded by a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)(\/[^\/]*)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that is not a forward slash, followed by a forward slash, and then any sequence of characters that is not a forward slash, followed by a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the sequence of characters is preceded by a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)(\/[^\/]*)$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of characters that is not a forward slash, followed by a forward slash
