 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not accept negative arguments as `substr` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the resulting string is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the resulting string is incorrect and the suffix is changed to 'us'.

DONE.
