  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` would return `true` if the two values are not equal, whereas `isEqual` would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNot` would return `true` if the two values are not the same object, whereas `isEqual` would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotIdentical
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotIdentical` would return `true` if the two values are not identical, whereas `isEqual` would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
