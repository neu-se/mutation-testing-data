Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would not be able to create a valid promise object, leading to a failure when trying to resolve or reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `defer` function may cause it to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections or incorrect promise states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of an expected object to the `defer` function would likely cause it to throw an error or behave incorrectly, as it would not be able to handle the string as a valid input.

DONE.
