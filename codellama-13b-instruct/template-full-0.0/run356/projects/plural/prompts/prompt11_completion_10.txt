  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` to remove the last character of the word, which would result in words like "cherry" becoming "cheri" instead of "cherries". The new code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, which would result in words like "cherry" becoming "cherries" as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` to remove the last character of the word, which would result in words like "cherry" becoming "cheri" instead of "cherries". The new code fragment uses `w +
