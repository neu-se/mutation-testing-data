Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.open
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.open` is an asynchronous method that returns a callback, whereas `this.openSync` is a synchronous method that returns the file descriptor directly, so the code would not wait for the file to be opened before trying to use the file descriptor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.openBase
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.openBase` might have a different implementation or parameters than `this.openSync`, potentially leading to differences in how the file is opened or the file descriptor is returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.closeSync` closes a file descriptor, whereas `this.openSync` opens a file and returns a file descriptor, so the code would attempt to close a file descriptor before it is even opened, likely resulting in an error.

DONE.
