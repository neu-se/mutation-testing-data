  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "GET"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be set to "GET", regardless of the actual verb used in the request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be set to "POST", regardless of the actual verb used in the request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "PUT"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be set to "PUT", regardless of the actual verb used in the request.

DONE.
