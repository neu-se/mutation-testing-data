  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would increment the value of `key` by 1, which would change the behavior of the `set` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `key`, which would change the behavior of the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `key`, which would change the behavior of the `set` method.

DONE.
