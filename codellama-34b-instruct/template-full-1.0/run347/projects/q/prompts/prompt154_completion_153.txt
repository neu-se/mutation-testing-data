  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the space character at the end would cause the stack traces to be concatenated with a space between them, rather than a newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the tab character at the end would cause the stack traces to be concatenated with a tab between them, rather than a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the letter "a" at the end would cause the stack traces to be concatenated with the letter "a" between them, rather than a newline.

DONE.
