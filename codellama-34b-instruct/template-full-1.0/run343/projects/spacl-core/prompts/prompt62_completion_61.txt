  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of an array, whereas `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of an array, whereas `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1).concat(props[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the remaining elements of the array with the first element, whereas `reverse()` reverses the order of the entire array.

DONE.
