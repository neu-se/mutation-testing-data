Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= answerPs.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `<=` instead of `<`, which would cause the loop to attempt to access an index that is out of bounds on the last iteration, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i = 1; i < answerPs.length; i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it starts the loop at `1` instead of `0`, causing the first promise in the `answerPs` array to be skipped and not processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i = 0; i < answerPs.length - 1; i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates only up to `answerPs.length - 1`, thus missing the last promise in the array, which could lead to incomplete processing of the promises.

DONE.
