  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method would be called with a `null` value, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method would be called with an `undefined` value, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify()` method would be called with a string value, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

DONE.
