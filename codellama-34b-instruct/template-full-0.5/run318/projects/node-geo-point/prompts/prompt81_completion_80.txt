  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `coordinate.latitude` is different from `coordinate.longitude` and would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `coordinate.latitude + 1` is different from `coordinate.longitude` and would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `coordinate.longitude + Math.PI` is different from `coordinate.longitude` and would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

DONE.
