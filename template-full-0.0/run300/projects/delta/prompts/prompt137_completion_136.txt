  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it is not `null`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `firstOther.attributes` is not `null`, which could lead to different behavior in the code that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it is equal to the string `'foo'`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `firstOther.attributes` is equal to `'foo'`, which could lead to different behavior in the code
