  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` if the operand is truthy. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is truthy and `false` if the operand is falsy. Therefore, `!p` would return the opposite of `!!p`, which could cause the code to behave differently.
