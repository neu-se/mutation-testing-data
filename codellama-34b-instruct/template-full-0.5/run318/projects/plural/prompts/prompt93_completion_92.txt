  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not a valid JavaScript code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a typo, the correct plural form of the word "chilli" is "chillis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not a valid JavaScript code.

DONE.
