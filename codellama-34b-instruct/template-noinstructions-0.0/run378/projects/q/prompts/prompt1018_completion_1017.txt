  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, potentially causing the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, while `null` would resolve the promise with a value of `null`, potentially causing the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, while `throw new Error("test")` would throw an error, potentially causing the test to fail even if the code is correct.

DONE.
