  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function, and `null` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "function".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "function".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function, and `void 0` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "function".

DONE.
