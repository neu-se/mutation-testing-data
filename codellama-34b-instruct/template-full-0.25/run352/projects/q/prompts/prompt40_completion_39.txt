  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout delay is changed from 0 to 1, which would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1 millisecond instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is called with an additional argument `true`, which would cause the `flush` function to be called with the `this` context set to the global object instead of the `window` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is called with an additional argument `false`, which would cause the `flush` function to be called with the `this` context set to the global object instead of the `window` object.

DONE.
