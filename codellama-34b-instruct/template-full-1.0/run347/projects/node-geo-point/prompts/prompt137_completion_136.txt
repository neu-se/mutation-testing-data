  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const adjust = (input: number) => parseFloat(input.toFixed(precision - 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toFixed` method rounds the number to a specified number of decimals, but the `- 1` makes it round to one fewer decimal places than requested, which could cause the calculation to be off by a significant amount.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const adjust = (input: number) => parseFloat(input.toFixed(precision + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toFixed` method rounds the number to a specified number of decimals, but the `+ 1` makes it round to one more decimal place than requested, which could cause the calculation to be off by a significantly smaller amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const adjust = (input: number) => Math.round(input * Math.pow(10, precision)) /
