  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` object, which could potentially cause a runtime error if the `data` object does not have a `toString()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is accessed on the `data` object, which could potentially cause a runtime error if the `data` object does not have a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` property is accessed on the `data` object, which could potentially cause a runtime error if the `data` object does not have a `foo` property.

DONE.
