 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment converts the singular form "chilli" to the plural form "chillies", while the replacement code fragment does not have a plural form for "chilli".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'chilliess'
