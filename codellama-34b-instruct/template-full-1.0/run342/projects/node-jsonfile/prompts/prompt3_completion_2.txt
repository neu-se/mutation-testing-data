  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would read the file with a different name, potentially causing the file to not be found or read correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'invalidfile.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would read a file with a different name, potentially causing the file to not be found or read correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '.json.bak')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would read a file with a different extension, potentially causing the file to not be found or read correctly.

DONE.
