  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || !process || !process.env || !process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of `typeof`, and the expression is negated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression checks for the presence of the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable, but does not check the value of `process` or `process.env`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG !== process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression checks for the presence of the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable, but does not check the value of `process` or `process.env`. Additionally, the expression is self-referential, which could cause issues with the code.

DONE.
