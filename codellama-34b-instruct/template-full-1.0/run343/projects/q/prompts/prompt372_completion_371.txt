  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(null, e)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `Q.onerror` is not called with the correct context object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function is not called with any arguments, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `Q.onerror` is not called with the correct context object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
