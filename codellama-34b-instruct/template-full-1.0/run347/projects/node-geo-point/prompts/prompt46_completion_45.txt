  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(360 - φ1)
```
This would result in a different calculation of the destination point's latitude,
as the bearing would no longer be taken into account.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(180 - φ1)
```
This would result in a different calculation of the destination point's latitude,
as the bearing would be reversed, causing the destination point to be 180 degrees
away from the starting point instead of in the same direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(φ1 * 2)
```
This would result in a different calculation of the destination point's latitude,
as the bearing would be doubled, causing the destination point to be 180 degrees
away from the starting point.

DONE.
