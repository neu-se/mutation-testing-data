 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will no longer consider the arguments passed to it when calling the bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will not pass any arguments to the bound function, instead of passing the arguments provided when calling `fbound`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will pass a hardcoded array as the arguments to the bound function, instead of passing the arguments provided when calling `fbound`.

DONE.
