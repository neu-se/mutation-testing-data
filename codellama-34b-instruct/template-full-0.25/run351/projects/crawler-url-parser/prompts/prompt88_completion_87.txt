  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the first word of the link text, while the original code fragment extracts the entire link text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the words after the first word of the link text, while the original code fragment extracts the entire link text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(0, -1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the words before the last word of the link text, while the original code fragment extracts the entire link text.

DONE.
