 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...this.rules.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over values instead of elements, potentially changing the order and causing issues if the rules have side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with all elements, which could cause performance issues and unexpected behavior if the original array has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...this.rules]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the array, which might not behave the same as the original array in some cases, especially if the rules have side effects.

DONE.
