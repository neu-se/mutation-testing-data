  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the hostname is not a match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if the hostname is a match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null, even if the hostname is a match.

DONE.
