  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the line, which would cause the diffing algorithm to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.splice(0, 0, ' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a space at the beginning of the line, which would cause the diffing algorithm to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = line.substring(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the line, which would cause the diffing algorithm to produce different results.

DONE.
