  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<a>
```
This would result in different behavior because `!<a>` will always evaluate to `false` when `a` is a non-zero number, while `Number.isFinite(a)` will return `true` if `a` is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` will always evaluate to a number that is greater than or equal to 1, while `Number.isFinite(a)` will return `true` if `a` is a finite number between 0 and 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * 0` will always evaluate to 0, while `Number.isFinite(a)` will return `false` if `a` is not a finite number.

DONE.
