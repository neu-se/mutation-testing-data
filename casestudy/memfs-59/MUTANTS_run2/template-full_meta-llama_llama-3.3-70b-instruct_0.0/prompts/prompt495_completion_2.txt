Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.canWrite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node cannot be written to, instead of checking if it's a directory, which could lead to incorrect error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isFile() && (flagsNum !== FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a file and the flags do not include write permission, which is a different condition than the original check for directory and read-only flags.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isSymbolicLink()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a symbolic link, which is a different type of node than a directory, and could lead to incorrect error handling if the code is not prepared to handle symbolic links.

DONE.
