  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, and the original code assumed that `cb` was a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` is the negation of `cb`, which is a boolean value. The original code did not negate `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value. The original code did not use `undefined`.

DONE.
