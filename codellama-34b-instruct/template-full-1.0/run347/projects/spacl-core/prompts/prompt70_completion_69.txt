  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path
```
This would result in different behavior because a negation operator (`!`) is added, which would invert the boolean value of `path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because a string concatenation operator (`+`) is added, which would append the string `'extra'` to the end of `path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because a numerical subscript (`[0]`) is added, which would access the first element of `path`.

DONE.
