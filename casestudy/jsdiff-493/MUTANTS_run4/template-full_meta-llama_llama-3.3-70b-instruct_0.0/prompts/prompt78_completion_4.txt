Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would only check if `obj` has the property `key`, but it would not check if the property belongs to `obj` itself, potentially including properties from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
canonicalizedObj
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called on the `canonicalizedObj` instead of the original `obj`, potentially skipping some properties that are present in the original object but not in the canonicalized one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called on the global `window` object, which would always return false for any property key, effectively skipping all properties of the original object.

DONE.
