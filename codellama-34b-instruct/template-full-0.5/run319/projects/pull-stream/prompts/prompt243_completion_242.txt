  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `abort`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`, which would result in the current stream being aborted and the stream of streams being aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `if` statement, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` if `abort` is `true`, and the current stream would not be aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `if` statement, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `true`, and the current stream would be aborted.
