  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse a null value, whereas the original code fragment would not throw an error and would simply return null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse an undefined value, whereas the original code fragment would not throw an error and would simply return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse an empty object, whereas the original code fragment would not throw an error and would simply return null.

DONE.
