  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `dstOffsetStr` to be different from the original code.

DONE.
