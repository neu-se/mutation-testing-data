Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd` returns the current working directory, which may not be the same as the root directory of the given path. This change would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the current working directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => destParent
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the destination parent directory, rather than checking if it is the root directory. This change would cause the function to incorrectly allow the destination parent to be any directory, rather than just the root directory.

DONE.
