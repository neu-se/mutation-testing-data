  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(this)` would return a bound function that always uses the current `this` value as the first argument to `array_slice`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)` would return a slice of the `arguments` object starting from the second argument and ending at the third argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
