  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.next` returns the next function in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(1)` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.next` returns the next function in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(2)` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.next` returns the next function in the iterator.

DONE.
