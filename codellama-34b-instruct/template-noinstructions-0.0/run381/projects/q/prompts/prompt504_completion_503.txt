  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function without the `apply` method, which could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with the `call` method, which could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function with the `bind` method, which could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

DONE.
