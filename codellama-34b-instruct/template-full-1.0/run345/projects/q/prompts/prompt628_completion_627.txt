  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a key-value pair, but only providing a value would cause the function to misbehave.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a key-value pair, but providing an extra value would cause the function to misbehave.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects a non-null value for the key parameter, but providing null would cause the function to misbehave.

DONE.
