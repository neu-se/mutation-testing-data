Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a rejection callback would cause the promise to ignore any rejection, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` as the rejection callback would also lead to the promise ignoring the rejection, similar to using `null`, and could result in unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Custom Error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the rejection callback with a function that throws a custom error would cause the promise to reject with that error instead of handling the original rejection, altering the error propagation behavior.

DONE.
