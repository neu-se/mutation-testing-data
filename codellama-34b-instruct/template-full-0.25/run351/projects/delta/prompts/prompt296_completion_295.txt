  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start iterating from the second line instead of the first line, potentially skipping the first line of the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start iterating from the previous line instead of the current line, potentially including the previous line in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start iterating from the double of the current line index instead of the current line index, potentially including extra lines in the iteration.

DONE.
