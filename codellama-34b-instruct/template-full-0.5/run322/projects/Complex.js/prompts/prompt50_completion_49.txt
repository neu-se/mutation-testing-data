  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is the argument of the complex number, while `a['abs']` is its absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['re']` is the real part of the complex number, while `a['abs']` is its absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a['abs']` is its absolute value.

DONE.
