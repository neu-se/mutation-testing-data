Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function to an array containing a single element `0`, rather than the actual arguments provided, which would lead to incorrect behavior when calling the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the intended arguments with the context of the current object, which would not be valid for the `nfapply` function and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments with `null`, which would cause the callback to be invoked with no arguments, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect processing of the callback's logic.

DONE.
