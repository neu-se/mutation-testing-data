  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would never be called, even if the mapping function completed successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the abort error, instead of the mapped data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called twice, once with the error from the mapping function, and once with the mapped data.

DONE.
