Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always retrieves the next operation with a fixed length of 1, potentially skipping over relevant operations that should be processed based on the remaining length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively retrieves no operations (or an empty operation), which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations in the delta composition process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve a negative number of operations, which is nonsensical and could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the iteration logic.

DONE.
