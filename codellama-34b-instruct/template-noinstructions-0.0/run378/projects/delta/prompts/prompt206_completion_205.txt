  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete(otherOp)` would delete the entire `otherOp` object, whereas `delta.push(otherOp)` would only push the `otherOp` object to the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push(otherOp.delete)` would push the `delete` property of the `otherOp` object to the `delta` array, whereas `delta.push(otherOp)` would push the entire `otherOp` object to the `delta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push(otherOp.retain)` would push the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object to the `delta` array, whereas `delta
