  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max
```
This would result in different behavior because `max` and `min` are different functions with different return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input
```
This would result in different behavior because `input` is a different variable than `min`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset` is a different variable than `min`.

DONE.
