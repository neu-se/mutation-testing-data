  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, while `isNaN` returns `true` if the argument is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is not a number, while `isFinite` returns `true` if the argument is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this['im']` expression returns the imaginary part of the complex number, while `isNaN` and `isFinite` return `true` or `false` depending on whether the argument is a number or not.

DONE.
