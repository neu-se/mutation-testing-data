  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the built-in `all()` function will return a rejected promise when it encounters an array with non-promise values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` will convert the `arguments` object into a resolved promise, which will cause `Q.all()` to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will exclude the first two arguments from the `arguments` object, which would cause `Q.all()` to return a different result.

DONE.
