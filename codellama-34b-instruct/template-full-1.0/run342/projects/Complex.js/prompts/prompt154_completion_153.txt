  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['im'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0) || (z['im'] === 1 && this['im'] === 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the values of `z['im']` and `this['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(z['im'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the values of `z['im']` and `this['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0 && this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the values of `z['im']` and `this['im']`.

DONE.
