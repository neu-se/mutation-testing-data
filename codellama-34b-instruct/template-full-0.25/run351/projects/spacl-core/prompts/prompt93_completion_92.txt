  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.delete` would delete the entry from the map, whereas `this.set` would set the value of the entry.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.clear` would clear the entire map, whereas `this.set` would set the value of a single entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the entry to `policy`, whereas the original code fragment would set the value to `policy.name`.

DONE.
