 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path` as a substring, instead of checking if `linkurl_path` includes `pageurl_path` entirely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.search(linkurl_path) !== -1

This would result in different behavior because it uses the `search` method to check if `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path` as a substring, instead of checking if `linkurl_path` includes `pageurl_path` entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `pageurl_path` starts with `linkurl_path`, instead of checking if `link
