  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function would throw an error if the `options` argument is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function would not throw an error if the `options` argument is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFileSync` function would use the default options if the `options` argument is not provided.

DONE.
