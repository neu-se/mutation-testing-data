Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the addition operator instead of the reducer function, which may lead to incorrect accumulation of values if `data` is not a number or if the intended operation is not addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `data` directly to `acc`, effectively ignoring the `reducer` function and overwriting the accumulated value with the latest `data`, which may not be the intended behavior of the reduction process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses multiplication instead of the reducer function, which could lead to unintended results, especially if the `reducer` is meant to perform a different operation (like summation or concatenation) on the accumulated values.

DONE.
