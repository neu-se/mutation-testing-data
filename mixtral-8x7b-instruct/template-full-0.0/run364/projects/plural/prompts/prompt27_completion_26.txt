 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last character of the word, instead of checking if the last two characters are 'us'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'us'.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 2, instead of the correct number of characters to remove from the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(w.substr(-2) === 'us' ? 2 : 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove only one character from the end of the word if the last two characters are not 'us', instead of checking if the last character is a consonant.

DONE.
