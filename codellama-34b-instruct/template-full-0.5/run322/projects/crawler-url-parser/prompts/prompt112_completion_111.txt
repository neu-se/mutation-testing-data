  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `let` keyword to declare a variable, but the replacement code fragment is using the `=` operator to assign a value to an existing variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `let` keyword to declare a variable, but the replacement code fragment is using the `=` operator to assign a value to an existing variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `let` keyword to declare a variable, but the replacement code fragment is using the `=` operator to assign a value to an existing variable.

DONE.
