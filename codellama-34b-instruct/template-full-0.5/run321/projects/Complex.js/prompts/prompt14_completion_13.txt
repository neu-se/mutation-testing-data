  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a given angle, while `Math.sin` returns the sine of the same angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a given angle, while `Math.tan` returns the tangent of the same angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a given angle, while `Math.acos` returns the inverse cosine of the same angle.

DONE.
