  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `all` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the input promises have been fulfilled. In contrast, `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the input promises have been resolved, either fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
