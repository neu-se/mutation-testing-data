  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would not be called if the `descriptor` object does not have a method with the same name as the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fallback === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would not be called if the `descriptor` object does not have a method with the same name as the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === void 0 && typeof fallback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would not be called if the `descriptor` object does not have a method with the same name as the operation, and the `fallback` function is not a function.

DONE.
