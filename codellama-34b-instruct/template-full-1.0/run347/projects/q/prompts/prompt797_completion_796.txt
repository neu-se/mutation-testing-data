  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (a, b, c) {
    return c(b);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the arguments and applies the progressed callback to the rejected case instead of the fulfilled case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (a, b, c) {
    return c(b);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the rejected value instead of the fulfilled value to the progressed callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (a, b, c) {
    return c(a);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the progressed callback to the fulfilled case instead of the rejected case.

DONE.
