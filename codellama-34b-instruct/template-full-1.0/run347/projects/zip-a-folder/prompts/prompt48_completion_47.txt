  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `finalize` method when the `zipArchive` object was piped to the `output` stream, but this code fragment calls `finalize` immediately, potentially causing the promise to be resolved before the archive is fully written to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output, { end: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only piped the `zipArchive` object to the `output` stream when the `zip` method was called with the ` SuppressEndEvent` option, but this code fragment pipes the `zipArchive` object to the `output` stream with the `end` option set to `false`, causing the `finalize` event to not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).finalize();
