  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof define !== 'function' || define['amd']
```
This would result in different behavior because the change in the code would result in the `define` function being called without the `amd` property being defined, which could potentially cause issues with the module loader.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the change in the code would result in the `define` function being called with the `amd` property explicitly set to `false`, which could potentially cause issues with the module loader if it relies on the `amd` property being `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the change in the code would result in the `define` function being called with the `amd` property explicitly set to a non-function value, which could potentially cause issues
