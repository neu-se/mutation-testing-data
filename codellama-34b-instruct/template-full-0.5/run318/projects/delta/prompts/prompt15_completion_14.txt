  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== null` would return `true` if `a` is not an object, but it would also return `true` if `a` is `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a != null` would return `true` if `a` is not an object and not `null`, but it would also return `true` if `a` is `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.toString.call(a).includes('Object')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Object.prototype.toString.call(a).includes('Object')` would return `true` if `a` is not an object, but it would also return `true` if `a` is an instance of a subclass of `Object`,
