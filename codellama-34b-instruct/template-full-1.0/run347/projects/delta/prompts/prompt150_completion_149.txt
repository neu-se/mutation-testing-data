  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to loop infinitely, as `otherIter.next()` is not called within the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to skip over the next operation in the iteration, as `otherIter.next()` is not called within the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to loop indefinitely, as `otherIter.next()` is called within the loop without any condition to stop it.

DONE.
