Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + path
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends a forward slash to the path, potentially causing the `matches` method to fail if the regex does not account for this change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the path, which may lead to a mismatch in the regex matching process, resulting in the rule not being applied as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx ? path : ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to return an empty string if `ctx` is undefined, which would likely cause the `matches` method to return false, even if the path was valid.

DONE.
