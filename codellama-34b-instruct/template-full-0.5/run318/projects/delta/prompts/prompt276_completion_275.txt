  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length` is a number, whereas `thisData` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` is a number, whereas `otherData` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.length + otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.length + otherData.length` is a number, whereas `thisData` and `otherData` are objects.

DONE.
