  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, which means that all promises have been resolved. By changing it to `pendingCount > 0`, the code will enter the `if` block if there are still pending promises, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount` is equal to 0, which means that all promises have been resolved. By changing it to `pendingCount < 0`, the code will enter the `if` block if there are negative pending promises, which is not possible in the context of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pendingCount`
