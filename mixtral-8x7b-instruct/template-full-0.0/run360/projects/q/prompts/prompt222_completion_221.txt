 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new empty object is created instead of inheriting from `defer.prototype`. This could cause methods like `defer.resolve`, `defer.fulfill`, `defer.reject`, and `defer.notify` to not be defined on the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is assigned to `deferred`, instead of an object created using `object_create(defer.prototype)`. This could cause methods like `defer.resolve`, `defer.fulfill`, `defer.reject`, and `defer.notify` to not be defined on the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.create(Array.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new object is created with `Array.prototype` as its prototype, instead of `defer.prototype`. This
