  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a built-in JavaScript object that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while `nodeArgs` is a locally defined variable that contains the arguments for the node-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [nodeArgs, 1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method of an array returns a new array containing the added elements, so `[name, [nodeArgs, 1]]` would be a different array than `[name, nodeArgs]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, {nodeArgs}]
```
This would result in different behavior because `{nodeArgs}` is an object literal, and `name` is a string, so this would create a new object with a property named `nodeArgs` that contains the `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
