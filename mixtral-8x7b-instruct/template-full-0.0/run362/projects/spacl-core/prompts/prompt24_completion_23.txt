 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `min` is greater than 0, ignoring the `any` variable. This means that if `any` is true but `min` is 0, the condition will fail, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
any === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `any` is exactly equal to `true`, while the original code checks if `any` is truthy. This means that if `any` is a non-empty string or a non-zero number, the condition will fail, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
max > 0 || min > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `max` or `min` is greater than 0, while the original code checks if `max
