  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an empty array, instead of an array with a single element containing the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with a single element containing the entire string, instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with a single element containing the entire string, instead of an array with a single element containing the entire string, repeated infinitely.

DONE.
