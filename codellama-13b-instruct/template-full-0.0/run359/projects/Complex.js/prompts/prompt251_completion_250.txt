  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a` is a constant, while the original code fragment `b` is a variable. This would cause the result of the expression to be different, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1` is a constant, while the original code fragment `b` is a variable. This would cause the result of the expression to be different, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `Math.PI` is a constant, while the original code fragment `b` is a variable. This would cause the result of the expression to be different, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
