  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, while the `!isNaN` operator checks if a value is not NaN. In this case, the `!isNaN` operator would always return `true`, even if the value is NaN, which would cause the function to return the wrong result.

DONE.
