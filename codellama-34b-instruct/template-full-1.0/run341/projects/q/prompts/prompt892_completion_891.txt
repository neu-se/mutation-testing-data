  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1 + 1` has a result of `2`, which is different from the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(function (x) {return x}, [object])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` takes a function and an array of arguments, and applies the function to the elements of the array. In this case, the function simply returns its argument, so it would return the `object` argument. This would be different from the original code, which applies the `Q` object to the `object` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost(object, "toString")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.npost` takes an object and a method name as arguments, and calls the method on the object with the provided arguments. In this case, the method
