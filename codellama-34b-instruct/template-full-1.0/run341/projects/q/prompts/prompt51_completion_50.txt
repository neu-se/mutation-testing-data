  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestSleep
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestSleep` is not a valid function, therefore the code would break and the test should fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestWake
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestWake` is not a valid function, therefore the code would break and the test should fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestSnooze
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestSnooze` is not a valid function, therefore the code would break and the test should fail.

DONE.
