  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the given angle, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the given angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.sin` refers to the `sin` property of the current object, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is a built-in function in JavaScript that returns the hyperbolic sine of the given angle, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the given angle.

DONE.
