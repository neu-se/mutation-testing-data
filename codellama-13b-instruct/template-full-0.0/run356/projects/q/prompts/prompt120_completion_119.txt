  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `hasOwnProperty` method of the `Object.prototype` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `hasOwnProperty` method of the `Object` object. This could potentially cause issues if the `Object` object is modified or redefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `hasOwnProperty` method of the `Object.prototype` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `call` method of the `hasOwnProperty` method of the `Object.prototype` object. This could potentially cause issues if the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method is modified or redefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.
