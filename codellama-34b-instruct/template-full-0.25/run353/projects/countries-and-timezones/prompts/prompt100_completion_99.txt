  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object, whereas `tzs` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs.length` returns the number of elements in the array, whereas `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs[0]` returns the first element of the array, whereas `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object.

DONE.
