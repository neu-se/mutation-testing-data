  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would always return `true`, even if the directory does not exist or is not accessible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would always return `null`, even if the directory exists and is accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would always return `undefined`, even if the directory exists and is accessible.

DONE.
