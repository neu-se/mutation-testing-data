  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the value of `data` as the first argument to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `cb(null)` would pass `null` as the first argument, which could cause the `cb` function to behave differently if it is designed to expect a specific value as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the value of `data` as the first argument to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `cb(undefined)` would pass `undefined` as the first argument, which could cause the `cb` function to behave differently if it is designed to expect a specific value as its first argument.
