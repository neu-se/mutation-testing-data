  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [val, cbs]
```
This would result in an error because `val` is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a `ReferenceError` when the function is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the destructuring assignments in the function, which would cause the function to behave differently when given the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [cbs, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the order of the destructured variables, which could affect the logic of the function if it relies on the order of the variables.

DONE.
