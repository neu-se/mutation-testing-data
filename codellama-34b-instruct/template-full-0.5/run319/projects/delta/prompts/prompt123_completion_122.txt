  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue one extra iteration, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue indefinitely, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit early, potentially missing some necessary operations.

DONE.
