  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, but this code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with only one argument, but this code fragment calls it with three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the original data, but this code fragment calls it with the original data plus one.

DONE.
