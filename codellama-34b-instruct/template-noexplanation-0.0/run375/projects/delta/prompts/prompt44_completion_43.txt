  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `a` is an object. This will result in the `throw` statement being executed, which will cause the program to terminate with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `a` is `null`. This will result in the `throw` statement not being executed, and the program continuing to execute normally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `a` is `undefined`. This will result in the `throw` statement not being executed, and the program continuing to execute normally.

DONE.
