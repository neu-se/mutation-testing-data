 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[#].*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that has a "#" followed by any character(s), instead of only matching the part of the URL after the "#".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/;.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that has a ";" followed by any character(s), instead of matching the part of the URL after the "#".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/&.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that has a "&" followed by any character(s), instead of matching the part of the URL after the "#".

DONE.
