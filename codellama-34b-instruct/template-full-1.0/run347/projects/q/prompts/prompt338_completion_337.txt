  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function which is used to retrieve the value of the promise, instead of the `inspect` property which is an object with information about the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `state` property of the `inspect` object, which may have a different value than the `inspect` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `value` property of the `inspect` object, which may have a different value than the `inspect` function.

DONE.
