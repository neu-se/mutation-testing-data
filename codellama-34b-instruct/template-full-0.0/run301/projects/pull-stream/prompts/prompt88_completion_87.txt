  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `prop` function, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `prop` function returns a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the result of the `prop` function, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the result of the `prop` function is less than or equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the result of the `prop` function by 2, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the result of the `prop` function is less than or equal to 2.

DONE.
