  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words that end with "s" and add "es" to the end, resulting in incorrect plural forms for words that do not follow this pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words that end with "s" and add "ies" to the end, resulting in incorrect plural forms for words that do not follow this pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/s$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'es') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words that end with "s"
