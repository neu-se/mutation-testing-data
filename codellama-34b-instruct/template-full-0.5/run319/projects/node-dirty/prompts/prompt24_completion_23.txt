  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, the negated value would be falsy, and the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, and if `cb` is truthy, the expression `cb && false` would evaluate to `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator, and if `cb` is truthy, the expression `cb || true` would evaluate to `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed.

DONE.
