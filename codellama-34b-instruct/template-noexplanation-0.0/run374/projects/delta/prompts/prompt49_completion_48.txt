  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return the values of the `a` and `b` objects instead of their keys, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return an array of key-value pairs of the `a` and `b` objects instead of their keys, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call
```
This change will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return the string representation of the `a` and `b` objects instead of their keys, which may cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
