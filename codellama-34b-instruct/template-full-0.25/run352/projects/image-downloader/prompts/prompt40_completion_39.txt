  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '1' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dest` variable is modified by appending a `1` to it, which would cause the file to be saved with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to `null`, which would cause the file to be saved with a default name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'new_file.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different file name, which would cause the file to be saved with a different name.

DONE.
