  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to be called with the rejection reason instead of the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified with the value instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `notify` method to be called with the value instead of the fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value instead of being rejected, which would cause the `then` method to be called with the fulfillment value instead of the rejection reason.

DONE.
