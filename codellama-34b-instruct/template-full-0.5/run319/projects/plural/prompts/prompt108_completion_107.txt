  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new fragment returns the input word in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new fragment returns the input word with the first character removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + w; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word with an 's' added to the end, while this new fragment returns the input word with an 's' added to the beginning and end.

DONE.
