  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y).isFulfilled` would return a boolean indicating whether the promise `y` has been fulfilled, instead of the expected behavior of `Q(y).join` which returns a promise that is fulfilled when both `x` and `y` are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y).then` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by its callback function, instead of the expected behavior of `Q(y).join` which returns a promise that is fulfilled when both `x` and `y` are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y).catch` returns a new promise that is rejected with the reason given by its callback function, instead of the
