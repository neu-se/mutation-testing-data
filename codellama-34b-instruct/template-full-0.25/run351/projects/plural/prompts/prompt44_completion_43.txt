  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `length` property of the `w` string to determine the index of the last character, while the new code fragment is using `w.length - 1` which would give the index of the second-to-last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `length` property of the `w` string to determine the index of the last character, while the new code fragment is using `w.length + 1` which would give the index of the third-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `length` property of the `w` string to determine the index of the last character, while the new code fragment is using
