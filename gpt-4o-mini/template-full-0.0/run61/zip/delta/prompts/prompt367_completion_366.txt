Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to treat all operations as deletes, potentially skipping over insert operations and leading to incorrect transformations of the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to incorrectly assume that the current operation is a retain, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations and potentially result in data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert' + 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a syntax error, causing the method to fail to execute properly, which would not be the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
