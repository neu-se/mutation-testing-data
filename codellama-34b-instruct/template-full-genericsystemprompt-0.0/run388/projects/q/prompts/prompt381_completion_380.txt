  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original value plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original value multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value - 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while this code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the original value minus 1.

DONE.
