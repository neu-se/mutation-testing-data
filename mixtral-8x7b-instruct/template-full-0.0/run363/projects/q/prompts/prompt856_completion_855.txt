 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be set to `null` instead of the original value, potentially causing issues in code that relies on the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Replaced value')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of resolving the promise with a value, potentially causing issues in code that relies on the promise being resolved successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be set to the current context (`this`) instead of the original value, potentially causing issues in code that relies on the original value.

DONE.
