  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the given key from the map, unlike the original code which only deletes the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the given key to `undefined`, unlike the original code which deletes the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the queue instead of from the data map, which could cause the application to behave differently for certain edge cases.

DONE.
