 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a division by zero error when `a` is zero, while the original code fragment would return `NaN` for the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive value for `a`, while the original code fragment preserves the sign of `a`. This change affects the behavior of the `logHypot` function, which may produce incorrect results for negative inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it squares the value of `a`, while the original code fragment leaves it unchanged. This change affects the behavior of the `logHypot` function, which may produce incorrect results due to the different input value.

DONE.
