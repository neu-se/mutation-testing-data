  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simply returns the input word, while this replacement code fragment returns the input word with its letters reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the input word with a single letter 's' added to the end, while this replacement code fragment returns the input word with all letters except the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the input word with no changes, while this replacement code fragment returns the input word with all letters converted to uppercase.

DONE.
