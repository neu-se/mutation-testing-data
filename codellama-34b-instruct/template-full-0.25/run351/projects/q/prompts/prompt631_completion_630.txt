  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "Property"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the strings "delete" and "Property", resulting in the string "deleteProperty", which is not a valid property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" - "Property"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract the string "Property" from the string "delete", resulting in the string "delete-Property", which is not a valid property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" * "Property"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the string "delete" by the string "Property", resulting in the string "deleteProperty", which is not a valid property name.

DONE.
