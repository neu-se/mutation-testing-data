  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.call` is a method of the `Function` object in JavaScript, while `callback()` would invoke the function directly without any context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply()` would invoke the function with a different `this` context and arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.bind()` would create a new function with a specific `this` context and arguments, while `callback()` would not have any context or arguments.

DONE.
