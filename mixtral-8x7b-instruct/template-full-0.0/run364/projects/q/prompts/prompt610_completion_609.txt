 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a function, not a promise. The original code expects a promise, so the test suite should fail when it receives a function instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new promise that is immediately resolved with a value of `null`. The original code expects a promise that is resolved with the `object` passed to it, so the test suite should fail when it receives a promise resolved with `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is used to handle both promises and immediate values. By replacing the original code with `when`, the test suite should fail when it receives a promise resolved with the `object` passed to it, because `when` would immediately resolve the promise instead of waiting for the next
