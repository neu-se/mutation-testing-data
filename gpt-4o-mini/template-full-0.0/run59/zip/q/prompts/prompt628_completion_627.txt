Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `value` parameter, which means the property will not be set to the intended value, potentially leading to undefined behavior or leaving the property unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters, which could lead to incorrect property assignment or unexpected results when the `set` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the property to `null` instead of the intended `value`, which could cause issues if the property is expected to hold a meaningful value.

DONE.
