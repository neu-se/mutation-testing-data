  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` parameter, which is not the same as the `offset` parameter that the original code fragment used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `utcOffset` parameter, which is not the same as the `offset` parameter that the original code fragment used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset + utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the sum of the `dstOffset` and `utcOffset` parameters, which is not the same as the `offset` parameter that the original code fragment used.

DONE.
