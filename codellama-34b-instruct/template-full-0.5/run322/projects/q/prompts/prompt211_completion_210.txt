  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arguments` object as the second argument to `callback`, instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to `callback`, instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string `"foo"` as the second argument to `callback`, instead of the actual arguments.

DONE.
