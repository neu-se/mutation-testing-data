 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype` version of `slice` instead of the locally bound `array_slice` function. This could lead to unexpected results when working with non-array objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `slice` method on `null`. This would expose a potential issue with error handling in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Mocked slice function'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of performing the actual slicing operation. This would expose a potential issue with error handling in the test suite and highlight the need for tests that cover error scenarios.

DONE.
