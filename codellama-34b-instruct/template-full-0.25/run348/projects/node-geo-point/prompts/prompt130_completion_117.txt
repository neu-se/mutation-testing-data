  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive a `null` value as the `coordinate` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `coordinate` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an `undefined` value as the `coordinate` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `coordinate` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would receive an empty object as the `coordinate` parameter, which would cause it to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of the `coordinate` object.

DONE.
