Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for illegal characters in the `currentUrlStr` instead of `baseUrlStr`, potentially allowing invalid base URLs to be processed without validation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` for the base URL check, bypassing the illegal character validation entirely and allowing any base URL to be accepted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends "extra" to the `baseUrlStr`, which would always make the check for illegal characters fail (since it would always be a non-empty string), potentially allowing malformed URLs to be processed.

DONE.
