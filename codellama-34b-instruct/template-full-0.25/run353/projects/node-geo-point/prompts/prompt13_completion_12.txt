  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with fewer than 2 elements, which is not a valid input for the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with more than 2 elements, which is not a valid input for the `fromGeoJSON` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with no elements, which is not a valid input for the `fromGeoJSON` method.

DONE.
