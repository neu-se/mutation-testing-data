  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + <PLACEHOLDER>(λ2 - λ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ1 + <PLACEHOLDER>(λ2 - λ1)` expression would always evaluate to `λ1`, regardless of the value of `λ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * (λ2 - λ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ1 * (λ2 - λ1)` expression would always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `λ2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2 - λ1` expression would always evaluate to `0`, regardless of the value of `λ2`.

DONE.
