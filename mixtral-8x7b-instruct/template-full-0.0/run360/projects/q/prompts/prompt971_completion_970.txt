 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is truthy, which changes the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function. The original code fragment, `args`, is either an array or undefined, and passing an empty array would bypass the error handling for the case when `args` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a falsy value, which changes the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function. The original code fragment, `args`, is either an array or undefined, and passing null would bypass the error handling for the case when `args` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1 === 2` is falsy, which changes the behavior of the `Q.nmapply` function. The original code fragment, `args`, is
