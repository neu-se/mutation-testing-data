  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function is called with the `this` context as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function is called with the `object` variable as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, "key")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function is called with the string literal `"key"` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
