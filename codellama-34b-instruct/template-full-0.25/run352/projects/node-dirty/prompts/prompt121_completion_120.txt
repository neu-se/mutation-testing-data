  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event with no arguments, while this modified code emits the 'drain' event with the number of in-flight writes as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event with no arguments, while this modified code emits the 'drain' event with the size of the queue as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event with no arguments, while this modified code emits the 'drain' event with the size of the data as an argument.

DONE.
