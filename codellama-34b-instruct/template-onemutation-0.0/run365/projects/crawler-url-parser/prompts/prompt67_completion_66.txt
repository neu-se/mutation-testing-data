  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the string at every occurrence of the "=" character, whereas the "!=" operator would split the string at every occurrence of the "=" character that is not followed by a "=".

DONE.
