  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to 0, while the modified code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to 0, while the modified code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['I'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to 0, while the modified code would return a complex number with real part equal to 0 and imaginary part equal to 1.

DONE.
