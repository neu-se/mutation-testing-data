  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `1` would cause the `Math.cos` function to return a value that is off by `1`, which would then affect the result of the calculation in the `return` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `1` would cause the `Math.cos` function to return a value that is off by `-1`, which would then affect the result of the calculation in the `return` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `2` would cause the `Math.cos` function to return a value that is off by a factor of `2`, which would then affect the result of the calculation in the `return` statement.

DONE.
