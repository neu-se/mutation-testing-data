  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply([...nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the argument for `fail` is a function that returns a promise that rejects with the error, while in this modified code, the argument for `fail` is an array containing the error, which would not reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs, deferred.reject).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the argument for `fail` is a function that returns a promise that rejects with the error, while in this modified code, the argument for `fail` is a function that immediately calls `deferred.reject` with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(deferred.reject).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the argument for `fail` is a function that returns a promise that
