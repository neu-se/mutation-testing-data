  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```attempt2```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2` has a different regular expression for extracting the file name and line number from the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```attempt3```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` uses a different regular expression for extracting the file name and line number from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```attempt1[1]```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt1[1]` only extracts the file name, while `deprecate` expects both the file name and line number.

DONE.
