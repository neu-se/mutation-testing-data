  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that will be returned as the result of the `nodeify` method, regardless of whether a nodeback is passed or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that will be returned as the result of the `nodeify` method, regardless of whether a nodeback is passed or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object will be returned as the result of the `nodeify` method, regardless of whether a nodeback is passed or not.

DONE.
