Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always evaluate to false (assuming the `isZero` method checks if the value is zero), thus bypassing the check for division by zero, which could lead to unexpected results when dividing by a non-zero complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the numerator is infinite instead of checking if the numerator is zero, potentially allowing an infinite value to be divided by another complex number, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part of the complex number is zero, ignoring the imaginary part. This could lead to a situation where a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part is incorrectly treated as zero, resulting in erroneous calculations.

DONE.
