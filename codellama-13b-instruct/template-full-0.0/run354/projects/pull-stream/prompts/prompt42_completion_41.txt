  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` variable would be `undefined` instead of an array, causing the `unshift` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` variable would be `null` instead of an array, causing the `unshift` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` variable would be an empty array instead of an array with the `read` function, causing the `unshift` method to throw an error.

DONE.
