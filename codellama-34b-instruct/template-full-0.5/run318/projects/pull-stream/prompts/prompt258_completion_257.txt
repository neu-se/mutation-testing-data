  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called even if `err` is not true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `nextStream()` function to be called even if `err` is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if `err` is not strictly equal to `false`.

DONE.
