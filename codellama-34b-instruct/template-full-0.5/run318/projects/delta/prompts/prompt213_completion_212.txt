  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new operation at the specified index, whereas `push` adds a new operation to the end of the delta. If the `concat` method is called with a delta that has operations at the beginning, those operations would be inserted at the beginning of the new delta instead of at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last operation from the delta, whereas `push` adds a new operation to the end of the delta. If the `concat` method is called with a delta that has operations at the beginning, those operations would be removed instead of being added to the end of the new delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds a new operation to the beginning of the delta, whereas `push` adds a new
