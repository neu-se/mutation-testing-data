  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by a different constant `c` instead of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (b + c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `b` and `c` before multiplying by `a`, which would give a different result than multiplying `a` by `b` and then adding `c`.

DONE.
