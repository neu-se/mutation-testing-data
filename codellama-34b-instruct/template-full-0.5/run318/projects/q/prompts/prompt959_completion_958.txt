  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the input array, whereas `array_slice.reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a new array with the same elements as the input array, whereas `array_slice.concat([1, 2, 3])` returns a new array with the same elements as the input array, followed by the elements `1`, `2`, and `3`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x > 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a new array with the same elements as the input
