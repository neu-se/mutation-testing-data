  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer check if the `extractFilename` option is truthy before assigning a default value to `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer check if the `extractFilename` option is falsy before assigning a default value to `options.dest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof extractFilename === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer check if the `extractFilename` option is undefined before assigning a default value to `options.dest`.

DONE.
