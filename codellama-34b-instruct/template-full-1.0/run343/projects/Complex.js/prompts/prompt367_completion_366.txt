  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now using the sine function instead of the cosine function, which would give different results for the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now using a random number generated by the `Math.random()` function instead of the actual value of `Math.cos`, which would give different results for the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now using the constant PI instead of the actual value of `Math.cos`, which would give different results for the calculation.

DONE.
