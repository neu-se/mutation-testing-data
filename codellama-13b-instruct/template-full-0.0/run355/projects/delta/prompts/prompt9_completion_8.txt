  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key = 'key';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now being assigned a value of `'key'` instead of being declared as a variable. This would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the string `'key'` instead of the keys of the `a` object.
