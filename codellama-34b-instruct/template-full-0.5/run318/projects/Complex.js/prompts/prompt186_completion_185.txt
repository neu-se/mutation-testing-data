  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is raising a number to a power, while the new code fragment is adding 1 to the number before raising it to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is raising a number to a power, while the new code fragment is subtracting 1 from the number before raising it to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is raising a number to a power, while the new code fragment is multiplying the number by 2 before raising it to a power.

DONE.
