  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a null callback, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a callback that returns `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a callback that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error.

DONE.
