 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function call with a null argument would not create a new deferred object, but instead return `undefined`. This would cause the `denodeify` method to return a promise that is not properly linked to the asynchronous operation, causing potential issues in handling the result or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer({ then: function() {} });
```
This would result in different behavior because a deferred object with an empty `then` function would not properly handle the resolution or rejection of the promise. When the asynchronous operation is completed, the `then` method should be called with the appropriate resolve or reject function, which is not the case here. This could lead to unhandled promise rejections or incorrect handling of resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer
