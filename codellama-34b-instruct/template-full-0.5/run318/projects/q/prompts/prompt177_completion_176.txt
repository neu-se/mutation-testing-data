  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that checks if a string is a substring of another string, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` is a method that checks if a string starts with a specified substring, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` is a method that checks if a string ends with a specified substring, whereas `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

DONE.
