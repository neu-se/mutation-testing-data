  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original code fragment, which could cause the code to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").toLowerCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is not present in the original code fragment, which could cause the code to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").split("/").reverse().join("/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods are not present in the original code fragment, which could cause the code to produce different results.
