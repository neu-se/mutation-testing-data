Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not modify the original string and can handle negative indices differently, potentially leading to unexpected results if the string length is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would start the substring from index 1 instead of 0, effectively omitting the first character of the word, which is not the intended behavior for pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` will cut off the last three characters instead of the last two, which would incorrectly pluralize words that should only have the last two characters modified.

DONE.
