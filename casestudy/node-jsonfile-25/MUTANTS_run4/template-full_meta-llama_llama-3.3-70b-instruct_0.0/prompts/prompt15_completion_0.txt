Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is an object instead of a string, which would lead to incorrect handling of string encodings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is not null, which would cause the code to incorrectly assume that any non-null value is a valid encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof options === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options` is a number instead of a string, which would lead to a TypeError when trying to use a number as an encoding.

DONE.
