  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `unique` function is now `false`, which would cause the function to return `false` even if the field is unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `unique` function is now `true`, which would cause the function to return `true` even if the field is not unique.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `unique` function is now `null`, which would cause the function to return `null` even if the field is unique.

DONE.
