  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would increment the `progress` variable, which could change the outcome of the `if` statement that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would decrement the `progress` variable, which could change the outcome of the `if` statement that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would double the `progress` variable, which could change the outcome of the `if` statement that follows.

DONE.
