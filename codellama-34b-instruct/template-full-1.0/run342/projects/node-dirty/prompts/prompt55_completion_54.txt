  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dirty'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener would be listening for the `'dirty'` event instead of the `'drain'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener would be listening for the `'flush'` event instead of the `'drain'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener would be listening for the `'write'` event instead of the `'drain'` event.

DONE.
