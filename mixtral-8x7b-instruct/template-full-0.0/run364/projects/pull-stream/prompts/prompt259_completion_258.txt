 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not have the same effect as calling `nextStream()`, which sets up the next stream to be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because a number is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a variable that stores the current stream being read, and directly calling it would not have the same effect as calling `nextStream()`, which sets up the next stream to be read.

DONE.
