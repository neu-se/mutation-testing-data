Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, ignoring the imaginary part and potentially misclassifying infinite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is greater than zero, which is unrelated to whether the complex number is infinite, leading to incorrect logic in the inverse calculation.

DONE.
