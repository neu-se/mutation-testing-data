 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would always be true, and the `deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value))` line would not be executed, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable would always be set to true, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. This could lead to some unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the `done` variable to determine whether the promise has been resolved or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always be true, and the `deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value))` line would not be executed, even if the promise is fulfilled. This is because the expression `1 === 1
