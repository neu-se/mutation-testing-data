  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator will decrement the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `array[i++]` would increment the value of `i` by 1. This change would cause the function to return a different value for the `cb` function, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.
