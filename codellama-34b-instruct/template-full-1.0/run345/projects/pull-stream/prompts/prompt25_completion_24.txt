  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the `pull` function would be reversed, which could potentially result in different behavior in the implementation of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]` instead of `ref[1]`, which could potentially result in different behavior in the implementation of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[i]` instead of `ref[1]`, which could potentially result in different behavior in the implementation of the function.

DONE.
