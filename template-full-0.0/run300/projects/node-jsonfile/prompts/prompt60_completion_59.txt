  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment also checks if the buffer has a length greater than 0. If the buffer has a length of 0, the original code would return `true`, while this new code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment checks if `content` is not a buffer. If `content` is not a buffer, the original code would return `false`, while this new code would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8') !== content
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment converts `content` to a UTF-8 string, while this
