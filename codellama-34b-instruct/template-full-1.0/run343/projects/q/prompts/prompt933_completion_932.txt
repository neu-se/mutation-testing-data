  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` is a function that is used to return a portion of an array, which is not related to the purpose of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, which would cause the code to fail because `undefined` is not a valid argument to the `makeNodeResolver()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument to the `makeNodeResolver()` method, but it would cause the code to fail because the `null` value would be passed as the `this` argument to the function, which is not a valid context for the function.

DONE.
