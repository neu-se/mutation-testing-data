 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the buffer would be empty before processing the last line, causing the last line to be lost.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the first line would be removed from the array, causing the loss of the first row of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buffer = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the buffer would be cleared before processing the lines, causing all rows of data to be lost.

DONE.
