  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'suffix'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path, but the replaced code would concatenate a string to the file path, which could cause errors if the resulting file path does not exist or if the file is not of the expected format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path, but the replaced code would convert the file path to uppercase, which could cause errors if the file path contains any lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file path, but the replaced code would remove the first character of the file path, which could cause errors if the file path is not the correct length or if the first character is important.

DONE.
