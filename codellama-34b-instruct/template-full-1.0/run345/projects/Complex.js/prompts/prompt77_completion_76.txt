  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator is replaced with the decrement operator, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely or even run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other iteration, potentially missing important calculations or altering the overall behavior of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as expected, potentially causing overflow or other errors.

DONE.
