  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.defineProperty` function is used to define a property on the `Complex` object, but the property name is not a valid identifier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` object is not defined, so the assignment would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype['__esModule'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` object does not have a `prototype` property, so the assignment would fail.

DONE.
