  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return the same latitude value, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return a latitude value that is one degree higher than the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to always return a latitude value that is twice the input coordinates.

DONE.
