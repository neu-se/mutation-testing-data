  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method expects a key, but would receive a string instead. This would cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would receive a different key than expected, which could cause it to access the wrong data or fail if the key is not valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would receive an undefined value, which would cause it to either fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
