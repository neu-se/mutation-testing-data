  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to incorrect results in the `isNaN` and `isInfinite` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could lead to incorrect results in the `isNaN` and `isInfinite` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking if the complex number is equal to 0, which could lead to incorrect results in the `isNaN` and `isInfinite` methods.

DONE.
