  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means the loop would execute at least once. Replacing it with `0` would cause the loop to execute zero times, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means the loop would execute at least once. Replacing it with `2` would cause the loop to execute twice, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means the loop would execute at least once. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the loop to execute indefinitely, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
