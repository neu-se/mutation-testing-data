  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new line of code would attempt to create a writable file stream with an empty file name, which would result in a `Error` being thrown. In contrast, the original code fragment would create a writable file stream with the file name obtained from the `targetFilePath` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new line of code would attempt to create a writable file stream with an `undefined` file name, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown. In contrast, the original code fragment would create a writable file stream with the file name obtained from the `targetFilePath` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new line of code would create a writable file stream with the file
