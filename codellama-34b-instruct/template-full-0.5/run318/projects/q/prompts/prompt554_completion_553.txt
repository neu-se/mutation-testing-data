  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `callback` function, which would result in a rejection of the promise instead of a resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of the `callback` function, which would result in a resolution of the promise instead of a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the `callback` function being called, which would result in a rejection of the promise.

DONE.
