  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 || b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator means "or", so if either `a` or `b` is less than 3000, the condition would be true, regardless of the value of the other variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 && b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator means "and", so the condition would only be true if `a` is less than 3000 and `b` is greater than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator means "or", so the condition would be true if either `a` is less than 3000 or `b`
