  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[1], point.coordinates[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, causing the resulting GeoPoint to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] * 2, point.coordinates[1] * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be doubled, causing the resulting GeoPoint to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] + 10, point.coordinates[1] + 10);
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be increased by 10, causing the resulting GeoPoint to be incorrect.

DONE.
