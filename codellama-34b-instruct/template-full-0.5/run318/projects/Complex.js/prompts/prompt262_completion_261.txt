  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code fragment uses the addition operator, which returns the sum of the two operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code fragment uses the multiplication operator, which returns the product of the two operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code fragment uses the subtraction operator, which returns the difference of the two operands.

DONE.
