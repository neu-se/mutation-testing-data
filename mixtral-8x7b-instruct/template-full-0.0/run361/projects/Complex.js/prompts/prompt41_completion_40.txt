 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm (base e), while `Math.log10` calculates the logarithm with base 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm (base e), while `Math.log2` calculates the logarithm with base 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` calculates the logarithm, while `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function, which is the inverse of the natural logarithm.

DONE.
