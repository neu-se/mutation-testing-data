  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only threw an error if the `error` object was not a string or didn't have any rejections. However, this new code fragment would always throw an error, regardless of the type or content of the `error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only threw an error if the `error` object was not a string or didn't have any rejections. However, this new code fragment would always throw an error, regardless of the type or content of the `error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejected the promise if the `error` object was not a string or didn't have any rejections. However, this new code fragment would always reject the promise, regardless of
