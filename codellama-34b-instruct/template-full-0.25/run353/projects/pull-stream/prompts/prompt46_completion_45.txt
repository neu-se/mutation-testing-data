  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate half as many times as the original code.

DONE.
