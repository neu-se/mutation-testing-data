  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent any rejection handlers from being invoked, effectively swallowing any errors that may occur.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent any fulfillment handlers from being invoked, effectively ignoring any successful results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent any rejection or fulfillment handlers from being invoked, effectively silencing any errors or successful results.

DONE.
