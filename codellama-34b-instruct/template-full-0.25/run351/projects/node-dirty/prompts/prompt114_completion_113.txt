  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that listens to the `'load'` event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load' + 'ed'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with a string, which would result in a different event name being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with a number, which would result in a different event name being emitted.

DONE.
