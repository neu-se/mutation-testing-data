  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the reason as an error, while the new code fragment would throw it as a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the reason as an error, while the new code fragment would return it as a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the reason as an error, while the new code fragment would return it as a rejection.

DONE.
