  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `insert` property of `baseOp`, which is a string, whereas the original code returns `baseOp` itself, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `attributes` property of `baseOp`, which is an object, whereas the original code returns `baseOp` itself, which is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `retain` property of `baseOp`, which is a number, whereas the original code returns `baseOp` itself, which is an object.

DONE.
