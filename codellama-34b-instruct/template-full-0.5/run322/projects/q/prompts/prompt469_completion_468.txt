  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value at the `at` index in the `unhandledReasons` array to `null`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `reason` property of the `rejection` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at the `at` index in the `unhandledReasons` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `reason` property of the `rejection` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value at the `at` index
