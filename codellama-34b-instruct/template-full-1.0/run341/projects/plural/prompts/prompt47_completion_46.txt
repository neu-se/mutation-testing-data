  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function(w) { return w + '' }```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an `'s'` to the end of the input string, while this new code fragment adds an empty string, which would not change the input string at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function(w) { return w.replace(/es$/, ''); }```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an `'s'` to the end of the input string, while this new code fragment removes the last two characters of the input string if they are `'es'`, which could result in a different output for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function(w) { return w.length < 5 ? w : w + 's'; }```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an `'s'` to the end of the input string for any input, while this new code fragment only adds an `'s'` to the end
