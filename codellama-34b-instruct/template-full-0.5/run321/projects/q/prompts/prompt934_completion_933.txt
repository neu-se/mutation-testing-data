  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.denodeify` function to return a string instead of a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.denodeify` function to return `null` instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.denodeify` function to return `undefined` instead of a function.

DONE.
