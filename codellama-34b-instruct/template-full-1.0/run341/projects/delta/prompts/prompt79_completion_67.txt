  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = lastOp.delete + newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would combine the delete operations of the last op and the new op, instead of comparing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert === lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the insert operations of the last op and the new op, instead of comparing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.length < lastOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the attributes of the last op and the new op, instead of comparing them.

DONE.
