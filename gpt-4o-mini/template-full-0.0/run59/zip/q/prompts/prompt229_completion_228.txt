Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only pushes the first argument of the `args` array instead of all arguments, potentially losing important data that should be passed to the promise dispatch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value into the `messages` array instead of the actual arguments, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a string "error" into the `messages` array instead of the actual arguments, which would misrepresent the intended data and could cause unexpected behavior in promise handling.

DONE.
