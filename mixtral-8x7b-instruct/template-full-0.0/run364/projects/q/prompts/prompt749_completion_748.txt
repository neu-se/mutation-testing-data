 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would always resolve the returned promise with `null`, instead of the actual result of the first resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve with the value of the promise at the same index, instead of the first resolved promise's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve with the value of the `this` context, instead of the first resolved promise's value.

DONE.
