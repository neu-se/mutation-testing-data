  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the b variable, which is used in the calculation of the real and imaginary parts of the returned complex number. Instead of adding the base and exponent, it would subtract the base and exponent, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the base and exponent by 2, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the base and exponent, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
