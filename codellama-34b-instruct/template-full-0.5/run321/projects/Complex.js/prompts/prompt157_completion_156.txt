  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `this` and `z` are zero, while the mutated code only checks if `this` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while the mutated code only checks if `this` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is zero, while the mutated code only checks if `z` is infinite.

DONE.
