  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the error object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the error object, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the error message, regardless of the input.

DONE.
