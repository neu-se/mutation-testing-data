  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is used to determine whether the code is running in a Node.js environment, and the `!` operator would invert the result, causing the code to behave differently in a Node.js environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isBrowser
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isBrowser` variable is used to determine whether the code is running in a browser environment, and the code would behave differently in a browser environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isMobile
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isMobile` variable is used to determine whether the code is running on a mobile device, and the code would behave differently on a mobile device.

DONE.
