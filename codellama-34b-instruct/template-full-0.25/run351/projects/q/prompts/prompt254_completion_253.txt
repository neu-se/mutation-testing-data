  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(["foo"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array with the elements from the original array followed by the elements in the specified array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
