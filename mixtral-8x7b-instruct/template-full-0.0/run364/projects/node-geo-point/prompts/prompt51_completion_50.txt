 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
-point1.longitude + point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of subtraction, effectively swapping the longitude values of point1 and point2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.abs(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive value, removing the ability to detect whether point2 is to the west of point1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
point2['longitude'] - point1['longitude']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses array-like access to object properties, which may not be properly tested in the existing test suite.

DONE.
