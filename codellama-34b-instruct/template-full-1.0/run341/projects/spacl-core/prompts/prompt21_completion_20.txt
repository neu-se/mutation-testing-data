  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'B'
```
This would result in different behavior because the path specification that produces the matcher would start with a different character, which would not match the original code fragment's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the path specification that produces the matcher would start with a different character, which would not match the original code fragment's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the path specification that produces the matcher would start with a different character, which would not match the original code fragment's behavior.

DONE.
