Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof input === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow strings to pass as valid objects, leading to potential runtime errors when the code expects an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `null` to be considered a valid object, which contradicts the original intent of the `isObject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat arrays as invalid objects, causing the function to throw an error when it should accept arrays as valid input.

DONE.
