 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default protocol, which might cause the `parse` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the baseUrl to null, which might cause the `extract` function to behave differently when checking for the baseUrl.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => parse('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the baseUrl to an arrow function that always returns an empty string, which might cause the `extract` function to behave differently when checking for the baseUrl.

DONE.
