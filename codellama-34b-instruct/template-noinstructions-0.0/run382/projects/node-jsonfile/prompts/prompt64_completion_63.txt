  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would return a UTF-16 encoded string instead of a UTF-8 encoded string, which could cause issues with the `JSON.parse()` method if it is not expecting a UTF-16 encoded string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would return an ASCII encoded string instead of a UTF-8 encoded string, which could cause issues with the `JSON.parse()` method if it is not expecting an ASCII encoded string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would return a base64 encoded string instead of a UTF-8 encoded string, which could cause issues with the `JSON.parse()` method if it is not expecting a base64 encoded string.

DONE.
