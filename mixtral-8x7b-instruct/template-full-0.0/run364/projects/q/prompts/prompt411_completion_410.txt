 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the inspection context instead of the default object, which could lead to different inspection results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the current execution context (`this`) as the inspection context, which could lead to different inspection results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `inspect` without passing any arguments, which could lead to different inspection results or even errors if the `inspect` function expects a specific argument.

DONE.
