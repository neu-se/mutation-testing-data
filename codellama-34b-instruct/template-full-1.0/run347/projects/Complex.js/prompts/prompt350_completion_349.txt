  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies `a` by `1`, while the new code fragment multiplies `a` by `2`. This would cause the final result to be twice as large as it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies `a` by `1`, while the new code fragment adds `1` to `a`. This would cause the final result to be one unit larger than it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies `a` by `1`, while the new code fragment subtracts `2` from `a`. This would cause the final result to be two units smaller than it should be.

DONE.
