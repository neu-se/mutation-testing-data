  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replaceAll` method is used instead of `replace`, which would replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is empty, which would remove any characters that match the pattern from the end of the string.

DONE.
