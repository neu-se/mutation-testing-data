  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the next token was a digit, whereas this new fragment checks if the next token is a space. In the context of the larger code, this would likely cause the parser to fail to recognize digits as valid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(tokens[i + 1]) !== ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compared the next token to the string ' ', whereas this new fragment converts the next token to a string and then checks if it is not equal to ' '. In the context of the larger code, this would likely cause the parser to treat non-space characters as valid input when they should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1].trim() !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the next token was a digit
