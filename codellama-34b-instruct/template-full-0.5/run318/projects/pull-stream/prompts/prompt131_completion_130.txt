  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run forever or until `i` underflows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would add 1 to `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run forever or until `i` overflows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would double `i` instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run forever or until `i` overflows.

DONE.
