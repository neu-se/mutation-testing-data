  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by 1, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the iterator by the length of the current operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not increment the iterator at all, potentially causing an infinite loop.

DONE.
