  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code removes two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove three elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code removes two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, whereas the original code removes only two elements.

DONE.
