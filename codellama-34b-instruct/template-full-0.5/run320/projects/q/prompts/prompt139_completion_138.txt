  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `p` to be the `source` property of the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `promise`, rather than assigning the `promise` object to `p`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method of the `promise` object, rather than assigning the `promise` object to `p`.

DONE.
