  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of `φ1`, which is the latitude of the point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of `φ2`, which is the latitude of the destination point. Using `sinφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would result in a different calculation for the destination point's latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of `φ1`, which is the latitude of the point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of `φ2`, which is the latitude of the destination point. Using `cosφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would result in a different calculation for the destination point's latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add
