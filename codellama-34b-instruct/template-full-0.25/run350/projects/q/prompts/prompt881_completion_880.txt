  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, while this replacement uses `deferred.reject` directly, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately instead of after the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, while this replacement uses `deferred.notify` directly, which would cause the promise to be notified immediately instead of after the timeout.
