  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `sinh` function's argument, which would affect the calculation of the `tan` function's result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `cosh` function's argument, which would affect the calculation of the `tan` function's result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of both the `sinh` and `cosh` functions' arguments, which would affect the calculation of the `tan` function's result.

DONE.
