  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: index }
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be the index of the promise in the array, rather than the actual progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: promises[index] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be the promise at the current index, rather than the actual progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: index * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be twice the index of the promise in the array, rather than the actual progress value.

DONE.
