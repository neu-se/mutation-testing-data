  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `PLACEHOLDER` to determine the number of elements to include in the slice, while the modified code would include all elements except the last one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `PLACEHOLDER` to determine the number of elements to include in the slice, while the modified code would include all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `PLACEHOLDER` to determine the number of elements to include in the slice, while the modified code would include only the first element.

DONE.
