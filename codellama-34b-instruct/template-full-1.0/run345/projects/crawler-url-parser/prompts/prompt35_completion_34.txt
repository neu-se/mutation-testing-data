  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would throw an error if passed `null` instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would treat `undefined` as an empty string, resulting in a different URL being parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would interpret the string as a url and assign the `parsedUrl` variable to an object with the properties of that url, whereas the original implementation assigned `parsedUrl` to an object with properties of the `currentUrlStr` url.

DONE.
