  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array is not used in the `untrackRejection` function, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array is not used in the `untrackRejection` function, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array is not used in the `untrackRejection` function, so the code would not work as intended.

DONE.
