  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, which would cause the loop to iterate over a different array than the original code.

DONE.
