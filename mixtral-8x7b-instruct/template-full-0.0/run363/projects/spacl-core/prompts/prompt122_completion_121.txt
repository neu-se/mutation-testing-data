 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<undefined>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError` when the `matches` method is called, as `path.match` is called on an undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.includes` checks if a string contains a substring, while `path.match` checks if a string matches a regular expression. This could lead to false positives or negatives in the `matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the string, which would likely lead to incorrect results in the `matches` method.

DONE.
