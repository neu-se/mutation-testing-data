  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `this.longitude` is actually truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-0
```
This would result in different behavior because `-0` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `this.longitude` is actually truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it is not equal to any value, including itself. So the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `this.longitude` is actually truthy.

DONE.
