  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start extracting elements from the `arguments` object starting at the second index, instead of the first index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start extracting elements from the `arguments` object starting at the zeroth index, instead of the first index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with the `arguments` object as its first argument, and the second argument would be the index at which to start extracting elements.

DONE.
