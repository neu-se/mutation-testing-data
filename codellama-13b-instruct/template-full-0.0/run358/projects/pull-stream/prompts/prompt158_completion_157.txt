  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the `cb` function would be called with the `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the `cb` function would be called with the `true` value.

DONE.
