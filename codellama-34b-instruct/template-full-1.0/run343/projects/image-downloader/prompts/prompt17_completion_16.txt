  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.basename` to get the filename from the URL, but replacing it with a constant `"undefined"` would cause the function to always return the same value, regardless of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.join` to combine the dest directory with the filename, but replacing it with a constant `"."` would cause the function to always return the same value, regardless of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `path.basename` to get the filename from the URL, but replacing it with `path.dirname(pathname)` would cause the function to always return the directory name instead of the filename.

DONE.
