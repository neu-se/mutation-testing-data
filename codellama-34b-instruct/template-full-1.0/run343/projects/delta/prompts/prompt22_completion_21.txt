  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` checks for inequality, whereas `isEqual` checks for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` checks for inequality, whereas `isEqual` checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
=== isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `=== isEqual` checks for strict equality, whereas `isEqual` checks for looser equality.

DONE.
