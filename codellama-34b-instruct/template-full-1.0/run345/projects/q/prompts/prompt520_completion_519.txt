  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.done` is a boolean property that indicates whether the promise has been resolved or rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.notify` are functions used to resolve, reject, or notify progress on a promise, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function used to notify progress on a promise, whereas `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.done` are not functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver.resolve` is a function that is used to resolve a promise, whereas `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.done` are functions used to resolve, reject, or notify
