 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `concat` method combines the elements of two or more arrays into one array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object, whereas `concat` method combines the elements of two or more arrays into one array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.map(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array, whereas `concat` method combines the elements of two or more arrays into one array.

DONE.
