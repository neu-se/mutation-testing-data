Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent !== srcParent && destParent !== path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the function to continue checking parent paths even when the destination parent is the same as the source parent or the root path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent === path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for the destination parent being the same as the source parent, potentially allowing the function to incorrectly identify the destination as a subdirectory of the source.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent === srcParent
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for the destination parent being the root path, potentially causing the function to incorrectly terminate the recursive check when the destination parent is the root path.

DONE.
