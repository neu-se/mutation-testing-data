Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is explicitly `null`, which would allow the code to proceed even if `b` is `undefined`, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality (`==`), which would also evaluate to `true` for other falsy values like `null`, leading to unintended acceptance of invalid inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is not `null`, which would allow the code to proceed even if `b` is `undefined`, potentially causing issues when `b` is expected to be a valid number.

DONE.
