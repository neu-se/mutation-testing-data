  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(1)` is a constant function that always returns the value `e`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that takes a single argument and returns its exponential value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(z)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(z)` is a function that takes a complex number `z` as an argument and returns its exponential value, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that takes a single real number as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(z['re'])` is a function that takes the real part of a complex number `z` as an argument and returns its exponential value, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that takes a single real number as an argument.
