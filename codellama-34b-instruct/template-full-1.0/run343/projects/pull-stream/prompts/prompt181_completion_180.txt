  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function `abortCb` is called with the `onAbort` argument, but if the placeholder is replaced with `null`, the function will be called without any arguments, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function `abortCb` is called with the `onAbort` argument, but if the placeholder is replaced with `undefined`, the function will be called with an undefined argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function `abortCb` is called with the `onAbort` argument, but if the placeholder is replaced with `0`, the function will be called with a numeric argument, which may cause it to behave differently.
