  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation would be applied to the entire document, instead of deleting a portion of it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would only delete a portion of the document, instead of the entire document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would delete more than the entire document, causing an error.

DONE.
