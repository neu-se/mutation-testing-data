  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extractFilename` variable is inverted, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `options.url` property is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extractFilename` variable is compared to `false` using the `===` operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `options.url` property is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extractFilename` variable is compared to `true` using the `!==` operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `options.url` property is not present.

DONE.
