  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create()
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create()` creates a new archiver object, while `archiver` is a constructor function that returns a new archiver object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create({})` creates a new archiver object with an empty options object, while `archiver` is a constructor function that returns a new archiver object with a default options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create(null)` creates a new archiver object with a null options object, while `archiver` is a constructor function that returns a new archiver object with a default options object.

DONE.
