  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the operation was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `reject` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the operation was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a given value, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `resolve` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value,
