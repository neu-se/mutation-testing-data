  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of x before computing the sine, which would change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of x before computing the sine, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the value of x before computing the sine, which would change the result.

DONE.
