 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `peekLength` method without any arguments, which would throw an error since the method expects an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.length
