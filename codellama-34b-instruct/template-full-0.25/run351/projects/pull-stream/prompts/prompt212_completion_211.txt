  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `abortCb` function, while the new code fragment calls the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `abortCb` function, while the new code fragment calls the function with a null context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `abortCb` function, while the new code fragment calls the function with a null context and no arguments.

DONE.
