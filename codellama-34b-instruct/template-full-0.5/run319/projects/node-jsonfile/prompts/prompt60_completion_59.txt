  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `content` is a buffer, while this code fragment checks if `content` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `content` is a buffer, while this code fragment checks if `content` has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString() === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `content` is a buffer, while this code fragment checks if `content` is a string that is equal to 'utf8'.

DONE.
