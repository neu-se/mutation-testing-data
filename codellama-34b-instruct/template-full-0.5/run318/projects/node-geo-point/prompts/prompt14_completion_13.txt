  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray()` method checks if a value is an array, while the `!<PLACEHOLDER>.length` expression checks if the length of the array is zero. If the array is empty, the `Array.isArray()` method would return `true`, but the `!<PLACEHOLDER>.length` expression would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray()` method checks if a value is an array, while the `<PLACEHOLDER>.length === 0` expression checks if the length of the array is zero. If the array is empty, the `Array.isArray()` method would return `true`, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>.length === 0` expression would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
