  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `val` to be a non-null value, while `null` will throw a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `val` to be a defined value, while `undefined` is not a defined value and will throw a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `val` to be a non-zero value, while `0` will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `val` object will not be mutated.

DONE.
