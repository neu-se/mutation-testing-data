  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === undefined` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length === 0` would only evaluate to `true` if `args` is an empty array, whereas `args == null` would evaluate to `true` if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!args
```
This would result in different behavior because `!args` would evaluate to `true` if `args` is falsy (i.e., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string), whereas `args == null` would only evaluate to `true` if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
