  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call the `cb` function, whereas the original code fragment would pass the `cb` function as an argument to `setImmediate`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `setImmediate` function, whereas the original code fragment would pass the `cb` function.

DONE.
