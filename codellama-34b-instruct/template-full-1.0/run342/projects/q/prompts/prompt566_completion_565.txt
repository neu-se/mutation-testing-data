  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is a Promise, rather than the `when` function, which is what the code likely intends to use.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with the `result` variable as an argument, rather than calling the `when` function with `result` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is called with the `result` variable as an argument, rather than calling the `when` function with `result` as an argument.

DONE.
