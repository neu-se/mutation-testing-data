  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` returns a promise that is rejected if any of the input promises are rejected, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is never rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allFulfilled` returns a promise that is fulfilled only if all of the input promises are fulfilled, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled as soon as any of the input promises are fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of states (fulfilled or rejected) for all of the input promises, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises.

DONE.
