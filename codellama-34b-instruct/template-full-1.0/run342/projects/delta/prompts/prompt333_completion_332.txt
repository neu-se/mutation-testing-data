  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.inverse_attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inverse_attributes` method returns the inverse of the `attributes` object rather than the `attributes` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.inverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inverse()` method returns the inverse of the `attributes` object rather than the `attributes` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.inverse_attributes()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inverse_attributes()` method is not a valid method and would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
