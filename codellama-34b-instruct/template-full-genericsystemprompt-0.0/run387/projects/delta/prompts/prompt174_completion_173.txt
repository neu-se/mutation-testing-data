  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of the lengths of the two iterators, rather than the minimum of the two lengths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the difference between the lengths of the two iterators, rather than the minimum of the two lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute difference between the lengths of the two iterators, rather than the minimum of the two lengths.

DONE.
