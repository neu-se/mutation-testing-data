  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the state of the promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the promise, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the reason for the rejection, regardless of whether it is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
