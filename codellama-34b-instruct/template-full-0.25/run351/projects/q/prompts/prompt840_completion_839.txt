```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called. Additionally, passing an `Error` object as an argument would cause the function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called. Additionally, passing `null` as an argument would cause the function to be called with a different argument than
