  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!!` operator is replaced with `!`, causing the condition to always be falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p !== p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is replaced with `!==`, causing the condition to always be truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source` is not necessarily truthy.

DONE.
