  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the 'key' variable, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the value of 'key' and adds 1 to it, but does not update the value of 'key' itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of 'key' by 2, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
