  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "fulfilled" state is not handled by the original code fragment, so the `fulfilled` callback would not be called in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" && inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would short-circuit the evaluation of the second operand if the first operand is falsy, so the code would not always reach the `rejected` branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `settled` state does not exist in the original code, so the code would not be able to handle that case accurately.

DONE.
