  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would be stored instead of `row.val`, which could cause errors when reading or writing data to the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be stored instead of `row.val`, which could cause errors when reading or writing data to the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be stored instead of `row.val`, which could cause errors when reading or writing data to the database.

DONE.
