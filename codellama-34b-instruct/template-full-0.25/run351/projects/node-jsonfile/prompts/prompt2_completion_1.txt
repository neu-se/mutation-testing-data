  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file, whereas `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the contents of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'` instead of the default value of `'utf-8'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { flag: 'r' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is set to `'r'` instead of the default value of `'r+'`.

DONE.
