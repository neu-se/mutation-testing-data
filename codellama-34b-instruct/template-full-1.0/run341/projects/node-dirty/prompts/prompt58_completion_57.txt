  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit a `drain` event, even if there are still items in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the queue, causing the `_flush` method to return immediately, even if there are still items in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Test error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_close` method to throw an error, which would be caught by the `close` method and propagated to the caller of `close`.

DONE.
