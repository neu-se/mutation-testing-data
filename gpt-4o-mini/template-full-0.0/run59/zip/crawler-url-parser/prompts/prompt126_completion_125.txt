Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent function `parseUrl`, which would lead to a runtime error instead of executing the intended `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the parameters passed to the `parse` function, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the URL since `currentUrlStr` may not be in the expected format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `parse` function would likely cause it to return an invalid or unexpected result, as it would not be able to parse a null value into a URL object.

DONE.
