  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `type` is a function that returns the type of an object, while `type.toLowerCase()` is a string that always returns the string "function". This would cause the code to behave differently when it tries to compare the type of an object to the string "function".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof type
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of an expression, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object. This would cause the code to behave differently when it tries to compare the type of an object to the type of the `type` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.name` is a string that always returns the name of the `type` function, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object. This
