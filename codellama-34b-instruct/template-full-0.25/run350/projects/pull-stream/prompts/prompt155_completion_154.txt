  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument has been moved to the end of the argument list, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in a different order than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument has been replaced with `null`, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with a non-null value for `onAbort`.

DONE.
