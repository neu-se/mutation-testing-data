  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.call` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would not work as intended in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.bind` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would not work as intended in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.apply` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would not work as intended in the context of the code.

DONE.
