  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the Cheerio library to parse the HTML, while this new code fragment is using the `attr` method from the `base` element directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not setting the `href` attribute of the `base` element, while this new code fragment is setting it to a fixed value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', function() {
  return 'http://example.com';
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not using a function to set the `href` attribute of the `base` element, while this new code fragment is using a function to return a fixed value.

DONE.
