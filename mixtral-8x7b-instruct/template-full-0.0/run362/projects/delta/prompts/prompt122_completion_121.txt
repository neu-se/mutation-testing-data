 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the previous operation instead of using the placeholder, potentially causing incorrect calculations or side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the placeholder with null, causing errors or unexpected behavior in the parts of the code that rely on the placeholder being an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the placeholder with a new object that has an "insert" property set to 0, potentially causing incorrect calculations or side effects in the parts of the code that rely on the placeholder being a different object or having different properties.

DONE.
