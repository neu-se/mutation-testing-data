  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is the real part of the divisor complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part of the dividend complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because `d` is the imaginary part of the divisor complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part of the dividend complex number.

DONE.
