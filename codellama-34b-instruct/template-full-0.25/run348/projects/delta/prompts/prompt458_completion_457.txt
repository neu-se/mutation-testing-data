  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the offset to 1, regardless of the actual offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the offset to -1, regardless of the actual offset value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = this.index;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the offset to the current index value, regardless of the actual offset value.

DONE.
