  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.promise` property is not defined, so the `put` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: Q.defer()
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the `next` deferred object that was created earlier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: ends.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.promise` property is not defined, so the `put` method would throw an error.

DONE.
