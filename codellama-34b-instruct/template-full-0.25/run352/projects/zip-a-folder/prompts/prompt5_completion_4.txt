  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the `customWriteStream` if it is defined, even if `targetFilePath` is also defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the `customWriteStream` if `targetFilePath` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream ? targetFilePath : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `targetFilePath` if `customWriteStream` is not defined, and `null` if it is defined.

DONE.
