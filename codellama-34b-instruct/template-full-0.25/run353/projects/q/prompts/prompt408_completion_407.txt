  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the object is a promise-like object, which is not the same as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function checks if the object is a fulfilled promise, which is not the same as a promise.

DONE.
