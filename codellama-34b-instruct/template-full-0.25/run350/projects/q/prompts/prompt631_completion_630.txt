  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "Property"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a property named "Property" instead of the intended property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a property named " " (a space) instead of the intended property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a property named "undefined" instead of the intended property.

DONE.
