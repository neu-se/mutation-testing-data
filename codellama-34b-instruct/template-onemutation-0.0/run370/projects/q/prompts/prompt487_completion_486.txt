  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also splices `unhandledReasons` at `at`, but it does so before splicing `unhandledRejections`. By reversing the order of the splices, the `unhandledReasons` array would be modified before it is accessed by the `if` statement, potentially causing the `if` statement to behave differently.
