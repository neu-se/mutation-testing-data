This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original `universalify.fromCallback` function with a new function that always throws an error, which would cause the `_writeFile` function to fail when it tries to write the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise( async () => { throw new Error('Something went wrong!'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original `universalify.from
