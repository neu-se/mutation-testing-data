  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` variable, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` variable, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` variable, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
