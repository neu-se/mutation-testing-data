  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<PLACEHOLDER>` function would be called with the `this` context and the `point` argument, which could potentially return a different value than the original `calculateDistance` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<PLACEHOLDER>` function would be called with the `point` argument and the `this` context, which could potentially return a different value than the original `calculateDistance` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<PLACEHOLDER>` function would be called with the `point` argument only, which could potentially return a different value than the original `calculateDistance` function.

DONE.
