 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas `arguments` is a live reference to the actual arguments. This could lead to issues if the original code modifies the arguments object after passing it to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the enumerable property names of the arguments object, not the arguments themselves. This would cause the `fapply` method to fail, as it expects an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call(null, this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the current function with the provided `this` value and arguments, which would cause an infinite recursion loop. The original code fragment, `arguments`, is used to pass the arguments to the `
