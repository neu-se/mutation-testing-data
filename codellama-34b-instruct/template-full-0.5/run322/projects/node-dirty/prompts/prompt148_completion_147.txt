  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the array without the first element, which would cause the callbacks to be called on a different set of data than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided predicate, which would cause the callbacks to be called on a different set of data than expected.

DONE.
