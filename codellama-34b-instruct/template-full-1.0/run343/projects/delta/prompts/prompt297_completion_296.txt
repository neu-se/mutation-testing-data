  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `iter.next(1)` has been replaced with `iter.next(2)`, which will return the attributes of the next two ops instead of just the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `iter.next(1).attributes` has been replaced with an empty object, which will cause the `predicate` function to always return `false` instead of returning the attributes of the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been added before the call to `predicate`, which will negate the result of the predicate function.

DONE.
