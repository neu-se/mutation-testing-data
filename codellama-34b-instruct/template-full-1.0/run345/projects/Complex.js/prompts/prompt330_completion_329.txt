  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b` in the code fragment, which would change the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `b` in the code fragment, which would also change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `b` in the code fragment, which would also change the result of the expression.

DONE.
