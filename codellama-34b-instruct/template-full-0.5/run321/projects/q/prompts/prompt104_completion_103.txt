  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index + 1` would be passed as the second argument to `callback` instead of `index`, which could cause the callback to access different array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - 1` would be passed as the second argument to `callback` instead of `index`, which could cause the callback to access different array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length - index` would be passed as the second argument to `callback` instead of `index`, which could cause the callback to access different array elements.

DONE.
