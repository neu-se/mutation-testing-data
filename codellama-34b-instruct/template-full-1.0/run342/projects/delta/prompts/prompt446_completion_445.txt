  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the current op, rather than the length of the entire ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next op, rather than the length of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the length of the op.

DONE.
