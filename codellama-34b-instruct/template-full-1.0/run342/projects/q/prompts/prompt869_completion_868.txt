  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned the `value`, which is a potentially valid object, while the mutated code would return `undefined`, which is not a valid object and would cause the `deferred.resolve()` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned the `value`, which is a potentially valid object, while the mutated code would return `null`, which is a valid object but with a different type than `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned the `value`, which is a potentially valid object, while the mutated code would return the number `42`, which is a valid object but with a different type than `value`.

DONE.
