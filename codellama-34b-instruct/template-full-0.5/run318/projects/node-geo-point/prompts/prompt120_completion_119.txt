  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, bearing, distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `calculateDestination` method to use the `bearing` value as the `distance` value and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` value is multiplied by 2, causing the `calculateDestination` method to use a larger distance value and potentially return a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value is increased by 180 degrees, causing the `calculateDestination` method to use a different bearing value and potentially return a different destination point.

DONE.
