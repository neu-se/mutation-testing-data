  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be moving to the next index instead of staying at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
previousOp - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be moving to the previous index instead of staying at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rand() * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be moving to a random index instead of staying at the current index.

DONE.
