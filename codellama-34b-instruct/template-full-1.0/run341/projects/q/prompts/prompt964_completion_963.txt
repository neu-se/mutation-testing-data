  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a primitive value, while "this" refers to an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a primitive value, while "this" refers to an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because 42 is a primitive value, while "this" refers to an object.

DONE.
