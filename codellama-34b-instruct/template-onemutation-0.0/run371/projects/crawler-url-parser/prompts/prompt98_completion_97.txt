  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the URL is already in the map, while the modified code also checks if the text of the URL is already in the map. This would cause the code to behave differently if the URL is already in the map but the text is different.

DONE.
