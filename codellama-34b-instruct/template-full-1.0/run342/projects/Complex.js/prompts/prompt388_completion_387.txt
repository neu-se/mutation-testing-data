  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` will always be a different value than `2 * a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` will always be a different value than `2 * a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` will always be a different value than `2 * a`.

DONE.
