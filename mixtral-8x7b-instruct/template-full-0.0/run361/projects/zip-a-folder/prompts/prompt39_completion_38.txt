 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to zip the current directory (including the `node_modules` folder) instead of the specified `src` directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'..'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to zip the parent directory (including potentially sensitive files or directories) instead of the specified `src` directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to zip an empty string, which would result in an error when trying to access or create a directory from an empty path.

DONE.
