  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `_emit` is a private method and not intended to be called directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitError
```
This would result in different behavior because `emitError` is a different method that takes a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a different `this` context, which could cause the `emit` method to behave differently.

DONE.
