 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the encoding scheme used by the `toString` method, which may not be able to correctly represent the input content, leading to incorrect stripping of the BOM character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would raise a `TypeError` when calling the `toString` method, as it expects a string or an integer as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `toString` method to a function that always returns the string `'utf8'`, which would not consider the actual encoding of the input content, potentially leading to incorrect stripping of the BOM character.

DONE.
