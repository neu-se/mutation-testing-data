  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` is not the same method as `Object.prototype.toString`. While both methods return a string representation of an object, `toLocaleString` is more likely to be overwritten by the object itself or its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `bind(null)` on the `toString` method would create a new function that always returns the string representation of `null`, regardless of the object it is called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { return Object.prototype.toString.call(this); }).call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function creates a new scope, and `this` would refer to the global object instead of the object that `toString` was called
