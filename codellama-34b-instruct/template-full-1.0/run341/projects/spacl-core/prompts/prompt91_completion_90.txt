  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second element of the `policies` array, skipping the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter((policy) => policy.name !== 'dummy'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would filter out any policies with a name of 'dummy', potentially skipping over policies that should be applied.

DONE.
