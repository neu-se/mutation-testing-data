  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of the original word, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of the original word starting from the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice` would return a substring of the original word starting from the specified index, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of the original word starting from the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original word with the last two characters replaced with 'ices', whereas the original code would return the original word with the last character replaced with 'ies'.

DONE.
