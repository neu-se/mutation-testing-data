  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text = `${baseUrlStr} ${text}`;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the `baseUrlStr` to the `text` even if `text` is null, whereas the original code only appends it if `text` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl = baseUrlStr;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object, whereas the original code only sets it if `currentUrl.url` is in the `urlMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let retArr = Array.from(urlMap.values());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all the values in the `urlMap` in the `retArr`, whereas the original code only includes the values where `urlMap.values() != null`.

DONE.
