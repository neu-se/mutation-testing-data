  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, but the replaced code fragment would always return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, but the replaced code fragment would always return a rejected promise with an empty string as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, but the replaced code fragment would always return a resolved promise with the value `0`.

DONE.
