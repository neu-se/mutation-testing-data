  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a truthy value, while `0` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a positive number, while `-1` is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` is a number, while `NaN` is a special value that represents "not a number".

DONE.
