  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at key, while this modified code fragment returns the value stored at key plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at key, while this modified code fragment returns the value stored at key multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at key, while this modified code fragment returns the value stored at key minus 1.

DONE.
