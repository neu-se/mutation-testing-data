  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a different method than `npost` and will change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` is a different method than `npost` and will change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q. then
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then` is a method of the core Q object and will change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
