  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are horizontal and vertical components of the unit circle, respectively, while `Math.tan` is the slope of the tangent line to the circle. Using `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` instead of `Math.tan` would introduce a more complex function that is not directly related to the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + 1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180) + Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `Math.PI / 180` term has been added, which would increase the value of the y-
