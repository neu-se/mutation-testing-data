  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this = new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would be called on a new `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude values of 0, instead of the original `this` object, which could potentially lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would be called on a `GeoPoint` object with a different longitude value, which could potentially lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude -= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would be called on a `GeoPoint` object with a different latitude value, which could potentially lead to different results.

DONE.
