  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved when the 'close' event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: dest })
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an object containing the 'filename' property, instead of just resolving the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('File not found'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error message.

DONE.
