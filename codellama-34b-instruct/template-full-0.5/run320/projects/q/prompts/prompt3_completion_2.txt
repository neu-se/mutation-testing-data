  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buggy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the value "buggy", which is not a valid promise state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `null`, which is not a valid promise state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined`, which is not a valid promise state.

DONE.
