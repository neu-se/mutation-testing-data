  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).delete(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not delete any characters, while this code would delete one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not affect the attributes of the next operation, while this code would retain the attributes of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert('test');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not insert any characters, while this code would insert the string 'test'.

DONE.
