  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the error, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `10`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("simulated error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the error, while this new code fragment would create a new error object and reject the promise with that new error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rejects the promise, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
