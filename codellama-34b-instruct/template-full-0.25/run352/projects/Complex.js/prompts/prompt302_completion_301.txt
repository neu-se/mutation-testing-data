  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `b`, potentially causing the `cosh` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of `b`, potentially causing the `cosh` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` operator would change the value of `b`, potentially causing the `cosh` function to return a different value.

DONE.
