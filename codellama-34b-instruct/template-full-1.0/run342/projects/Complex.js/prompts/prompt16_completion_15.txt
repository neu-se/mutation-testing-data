  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns a number, while `Number.isInteger` checks whether a number is an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns a number, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a value.

DONE.
