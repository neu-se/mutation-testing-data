  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an object. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is undefined. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `exports` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is a function. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios.

DONE.
