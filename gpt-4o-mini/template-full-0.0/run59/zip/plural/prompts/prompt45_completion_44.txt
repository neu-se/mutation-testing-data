Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match words ending with a consonant followed by 'o', which would incorrectly pluralize words like "hero" to "heros" instead of "heroes".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the pluralization rule for words ending in 'o' to produce a plural form that is not standard, such as changing "photo" to "photoies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^[aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match only words that start with a vowel and end with 'o', which would exclude many valid words like "bamboo" from being pluralized correctly.

DONE.
