 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['\n']
```
This would result in different behavior because the split method is called with an array instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackString.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the string is split into an array of characters instead of an array of lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackString.toString().split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the toString method is called on the string before splitting it, which would add an extra step and potentially change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
