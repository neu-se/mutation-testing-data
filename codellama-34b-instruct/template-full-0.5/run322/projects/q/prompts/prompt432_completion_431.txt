  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns a string representing the state of the promise, and the comparison would always evaluate to `true` if the promise is rejected, regardless of the value of `reason`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is not always an instance of `Error`, and the comparison would evaluate to `false` if `reason` is not an instance of `Error`, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is not always defined, and the comparison would evaluate to `true` if `reason` is defined, even if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
