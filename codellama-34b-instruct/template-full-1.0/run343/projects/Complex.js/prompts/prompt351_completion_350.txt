  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` have different functions. While `Math.cos()` returns the cosine of a number, `Math.sin()` returns the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan()` returns the tangent of a number, while `Math.cos()` and `Math.sin()` return the cosine and sine, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, which is not the same as the cosine or sine.

DONE.
