  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname()` returns the extension of the file path, while `!path.extname()` returns the opposite, i.e. `true` if the file path has no extension. In the original code, the `if` statement checks if the file path has no extension, but in this modified code, it checks if the file path has an extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory name of the file path, while `!path.dirname()` returns the opposite, i.e. `true` if the file path has no directory. In the original code, the `if` statement checks if the file path has no directory, but in this modified code, it
