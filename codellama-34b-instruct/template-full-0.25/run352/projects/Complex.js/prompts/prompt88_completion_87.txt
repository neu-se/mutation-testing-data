  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous token instead of the next one, which could lead to a different parsing result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the token after the next one instead of the next one, which could lead to a different parsing result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1] + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would combine the previous token with the next one, which could lead to a different parsing result.

DONE.
