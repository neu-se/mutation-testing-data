 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the loop variable `i` instead of 0, which may not access the intended argument in the `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `ref` array and returns it, changing the arguments passed to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `ref` array and returns it, changing the arguments passed to the `pull` function.

These changes introduce different behavior compared to the original code fragment, making them suitable for mutation testing.

DONE.
