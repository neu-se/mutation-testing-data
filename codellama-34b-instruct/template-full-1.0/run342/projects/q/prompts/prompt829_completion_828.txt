  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the error to the console, but not throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new `Error` object with the message from the original `error` object.

DONE.
