  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` for finite numbers, while `isNaN` returns `true` for both `NaN` and `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(isNaN || isFinite)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!(isNaN || isFinite)` returns `true` for `NaN` and `Infinity`, while `isNaN` returns `false` for these values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` returns `true` for `Infinity`, while `isNaN` returns `false` for `Infinity`.

DONE.
