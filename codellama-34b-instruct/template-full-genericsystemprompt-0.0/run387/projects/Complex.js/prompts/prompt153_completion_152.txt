  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is real, while the new code fragment checks if `z` is purely imaginary.

DONE.
