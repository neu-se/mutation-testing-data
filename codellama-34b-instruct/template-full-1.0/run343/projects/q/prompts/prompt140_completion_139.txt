  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `!p && false` is always false, whereas `!!p` is true when `p` is truthy and false when `p` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p == false
```
This would result in different behavior because `p == false` is true when `p` is falsy, whereas `!!p` is false when `p` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~~p
```
This would result in different behavior because `~~p` is bitwise NOT of `p`, so it always returns a falsy value.

DONE.
