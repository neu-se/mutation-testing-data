  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(sourceUrl, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is not present in the original code. This would cause the `parse` function to return a different value, potentially leading to different behavior in the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(sourceUrl, 'http://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with a hardcoded URL, which is different from the original code that uses the `sourceUrl` variable. This could potentially lead to different behavior in the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(sourceUrl, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with a null argument, which is different from the original code that uses the `baseUrlStr`
