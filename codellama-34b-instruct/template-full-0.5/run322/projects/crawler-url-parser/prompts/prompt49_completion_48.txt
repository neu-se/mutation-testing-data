  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` would return a URL object, which would not have the same properties as the original `parsedUrl` object returned by `URL.resolve()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format()` would return a formatted string representation of the URL, while the original code fragment returned a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` would return a URL object with a different set of properties than the original `parsedUrl` object returned by `URL.resolve()`.

DONE.
