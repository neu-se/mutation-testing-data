  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match URLs with a default file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer strip the default file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '\1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer replace the default file extension with the first captured group.

DONE.
