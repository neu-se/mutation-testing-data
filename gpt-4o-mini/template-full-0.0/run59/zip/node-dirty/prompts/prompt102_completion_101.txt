Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of removing the key from the data store, it sets the value associated with the key to `null`, which means the key still exists in the data structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it clears the entire data store, removing all keys and values, rather than just deleting the specific key associated with `row.key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the value associated with `row.val` instead of the key `row.key`, which may not exist in the data store, leading to unintended results.

DONE.
