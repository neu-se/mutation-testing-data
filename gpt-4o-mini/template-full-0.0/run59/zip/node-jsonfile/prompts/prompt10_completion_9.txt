Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` executes the string as JavaScript code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected results, unlike `JSON.parse`, which safely parses a JSON string into an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.split(',')` converts the string into an array of substrings based on commas, rather than parsing it as a JSON object, which would lead to incorrect data handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Function(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Function(data)` attempts to create a new function from the string, which can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, as opposed to safely parsing a JSON string into an object.

DONE.
