  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort()` is a function call, while `sink.abort` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort(true)` is a function call with a boolean argument, while `sink.abort` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort(false)` is a function call with a boolean argument, while `sink.abort` is a reference to the function itself.

DONE.
