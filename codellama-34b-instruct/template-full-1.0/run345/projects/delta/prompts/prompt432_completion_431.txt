  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check the next `Op` in the array, instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `else` branch to be taken, which returns `{ retain: Infinity }`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Op` at the previous index to be used, instead of the current one.

DONE.
