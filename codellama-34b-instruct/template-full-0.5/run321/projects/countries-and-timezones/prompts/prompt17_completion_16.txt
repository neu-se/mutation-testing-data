  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `id` variable, which is an integer, and adding 1 to it would change its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `id` variable, which is an integer, and replacing it with a string would change its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `id` variable, which is an integer, and replacing it with `undefined` would change its value to `undefined`.

DONE.
