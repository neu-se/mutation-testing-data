  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a function that deletes the specified number of characters from the current position in the string, while `push` is a function that adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a function that inserts a new element into an array at the specified position, while `push` is a function that adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a function that concatenates the specified value to the end of an array, while `push` is a function that adds new elements to the end of an array.

DONE.
