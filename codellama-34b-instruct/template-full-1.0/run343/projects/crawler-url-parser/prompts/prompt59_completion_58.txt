  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator `!` to negate the result of the regular expression test. Changing this operator to a logical AND `&&` would result in the test returning `false` for all inputs, even if they contain illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!str.test(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test` method to check if the string `str` matches the regular expression `/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i`. Changing the method to `match` would only return the matches, rather than a boolean value indicating whether there were any matches or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\
