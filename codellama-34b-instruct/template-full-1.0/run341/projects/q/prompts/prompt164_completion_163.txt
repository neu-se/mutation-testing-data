  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, and would skip the first iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var j = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable would be named `j` instead of `i`, and would not have the same meaning in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable `i` would be reassigned to 0 instead of incrementing from 0, and the loop would run infinitely.

DONE.
