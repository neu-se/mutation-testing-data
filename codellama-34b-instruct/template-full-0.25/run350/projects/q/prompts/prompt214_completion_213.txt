  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and the original code used `isPromiseAlike`, which is a custom function that checks if a value is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if a value is an instance of a particular class, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if a value is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is defined on promise objects, and the original code used `isPromiseAlike` to check if a value is a promise-like object.

DONE.
