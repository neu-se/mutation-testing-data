 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` check would now be performed on the global object, rather than the object being inspected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because in a browser environment, `window` would be used instead of the current object, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math` is an object that doesn't have the `hasOwnProperty` method, causing an error and changing the flow of the function.

DONE.
