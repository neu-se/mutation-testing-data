  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrease the counter instead of increase it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to terminate too soon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over every other iteration, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to terminate too soon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrease the counter by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to terminate too soon.

DONE.
