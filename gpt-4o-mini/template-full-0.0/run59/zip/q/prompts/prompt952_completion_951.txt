Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with `null` as the `this` context and an empty array as the arguments, which may lead to unexpected results if the `callback` relies on the correct context or expects certain arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the array `[1, 2, 3]` as the arguments to the `callback`, regardless of what arguments were originally intended, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, [arguments[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument from the original arguments to the `callback`, ignoring any additional arguments, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect execution of the function.

DONE.
