  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` interchangeably, but `2 * b` would only use `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` interchangeably, but `a + b` would only use `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` interchangeably, but `a - b` would only use `a` and `b`.

DONE.
