  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not defined in the original code, and its absence would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, and it would invert the boolean value of `threw`, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is a strict equality operator, and it would compare the value of `threw` to the boolean value `true`. However, `threw` is not defined in the original code, so this would result in a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
