Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of chopping the delta to remove any empty operations, it would concatenate an empty delta, potentially leading to an incorrect representation of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `retDelta` without applying the `chop()` method, which means that any empty operations would remain in the delta, altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta.delete(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one operation from `retDelta`, which could lead to loss of data and an incorrect delta representation, rather than simply chopping off any empty operations.

DONE.
