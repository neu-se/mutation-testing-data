  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be decreased by 1, which could also lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1000, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

DONE.
