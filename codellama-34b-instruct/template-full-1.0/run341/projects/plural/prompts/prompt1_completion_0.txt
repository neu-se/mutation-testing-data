  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a method on the String object that returns a specified number of characters from the start of the string, whereas `slice` returns a shallow copy of a specified portion of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would return a portion of the string starting from the second character, whereas `slice()` returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(-2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(-2)` would return the last two characters of the string, whereas `substring(1)` would return the entire string except for the first character.

DONE.
