  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `Math.sin` returns the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number, while `Math.sin` returns the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cot
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cot` returns the cotangent of a number, while `Math.sin` returns the sine.

DONE.
