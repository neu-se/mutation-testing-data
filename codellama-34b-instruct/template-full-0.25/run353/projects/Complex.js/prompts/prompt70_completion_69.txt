  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.split` returns an array of strings, whereas `a.match` returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.replace` returns a new string with the replaced values, whereas `a.match` returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.search` returns the index of the first match, whereas `a.match` returns an array of matches.

DONE.
