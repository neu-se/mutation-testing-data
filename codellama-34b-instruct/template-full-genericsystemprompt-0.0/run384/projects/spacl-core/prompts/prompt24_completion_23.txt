  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 1 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max > 1` condition would always be true when `max` is greater than 1, regardless of the value of `any`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max > 0` condition would always be true when `max` is greater than 0, regardless of the value of `any`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!any` condition would always be true when `any` is false, regardless of the value of `max`.

DONE.
