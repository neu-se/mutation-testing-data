  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` would add 1 to the variable `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * 2` would double the value of `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b = 0` would set the value of `b` to 0, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
