  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is a different object than `attr`, and the `invert` function is expected to invert the attributes of the `attr` object, not the `base` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different object than `attr`, and the `invert` function is expected to invert the attributes of the `attr` object, not the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and the `invert` function is expected to invert the attributes of an object, not a non-object value.

DONE.
