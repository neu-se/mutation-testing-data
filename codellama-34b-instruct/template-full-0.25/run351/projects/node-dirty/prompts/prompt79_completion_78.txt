  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is the same, but the `emit` method would be called with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would not be called with the expected arguments.

DONE.
