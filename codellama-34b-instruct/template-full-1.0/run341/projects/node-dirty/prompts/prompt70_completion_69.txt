  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event is emitted, signaling that the database has been loaded, even though it has not been fully loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted, signaling that an error has occurred, even though the database has not been loaded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted, signaling that all pending database writes have been processed, even though the database has not been loaded.

DONE.
