  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ1+1` expression would shift the point by 1 degree in the latitude direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ1*2` expression would double the value of the latitude, resulting in a point that is twice as far north or south as the original point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π - φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `π-φ1` expression would flip the latitude value, resulting in a point that is on the opposite side of the globe.

DONE.
