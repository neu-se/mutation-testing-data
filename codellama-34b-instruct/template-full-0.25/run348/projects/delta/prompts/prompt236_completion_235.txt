  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss a difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next operation in the other iterator if it has a length of at least 2, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss a difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the next operation in the other iterator to have a length twice as long as it actually is, potentially causing the diff algorithm to miss a difference.

DONE.
