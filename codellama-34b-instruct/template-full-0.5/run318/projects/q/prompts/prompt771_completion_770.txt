  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch any rejections that occur in the `allSettled` method, preventing them from being propagated to the rest of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore any rejections that occur in the `allSettled` method, preventing them from being propagated to the rest of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function() {}, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore any rejections that occur in the `allSettled` method, preventing them from being propagated to the rest of the promise chain. Additionally, it would also ignore any fulfillment values
