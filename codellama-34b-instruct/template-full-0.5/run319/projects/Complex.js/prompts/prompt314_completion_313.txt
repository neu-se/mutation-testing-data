  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment references the `b` property of the `Complex` object, while the replacement code fragment references the `a` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `b` property of the `Complex` object, while the replacement code fragment adds 1 to the `b` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `b` property of the `Complex` object, while the replacement code fragment multiplies the `b` property by 2.

DONE.
