  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while the new code fragment checks if it is not a buffer. This change would cause the `stripBom` function to behave differently for non-buffer inputs.

DONE.
