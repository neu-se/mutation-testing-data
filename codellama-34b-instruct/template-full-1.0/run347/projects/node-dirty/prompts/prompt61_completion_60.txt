  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the parentheses, which would result in a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because end() is a method that signals the end of the readable stream, whereas destroy() is a method that destroys the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because close() is a method that closes the stream, whereas destroy() and end() are methods that terminate the stream.

DONE.
