  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, which is different from the original code fragment that resolved the promise with the value of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`, which is different from the original code fragment that resolved the promise with the value of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `this + 1`, which is different from the original code fragment that resolved the promise with the value of `this`.

DONE.
