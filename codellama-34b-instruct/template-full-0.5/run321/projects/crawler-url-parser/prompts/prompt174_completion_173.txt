  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("something else");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs "for testing purpose" to the console, while the modified code logs "something else".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(res1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not log anything to the console, while the modified code logs the value of `res1` to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let res2 = getlevel("sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc", "sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `getlevel` with the arguments `"sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc"` and `"sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc"`, while the modified code calls `getlevel` with the arguments `"sub.domain.com/aa
