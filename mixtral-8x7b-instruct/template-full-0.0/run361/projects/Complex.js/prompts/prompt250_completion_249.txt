 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.cos is an even function while Math.cosh is an even function with positive output. This change would affect the results of the 'expm1' method for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin is an odd function while Math.cos is an even function. This change would affect the results of the 'expm1' method for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.abs returns the absolute value of a number, while Math.cos returns the cosine of a number. This change would affect the results of the 'expm1' method for certain input values, especially when the real part of the input complex number is negative.

DONE.
