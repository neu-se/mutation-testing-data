  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `value` parameter in the `then` method, and would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `value` parameter in the `then` method, but it would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `value`, so if `value` is truthy, it would be replaced with `false`, and if `value` is falsy, it would be replaced with `true`. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the opposite value of what is expected.

DONE.
