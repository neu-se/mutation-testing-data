  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `options` array as the `options` argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, instead of passing the entire `options` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `options` array as the `options` argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, instead of passing the entire `options` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `country` property of the `options` object as the `options` argument to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, instead of passing the entire `options` object.

DONE.
