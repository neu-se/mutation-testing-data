  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve()` method is called immediately, which would cause the `put()` method to resolve the promise immediately, rather than waiting for the `get()` method to retrieve the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject()` method is called immediately, which would cause the `put()` method to reject the promise immediately, rather than waiting for the `get()` method to retrieve the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method is called immediately, which would cause the `put()` method to return a rejected promise immediately, rather than waiting for the `get()` method to retrieve the value.

DONE.
