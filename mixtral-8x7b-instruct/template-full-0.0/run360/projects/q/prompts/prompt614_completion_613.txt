 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would immediately return a rejected promise with the error `TypeError: Cannot read property 'dispatch' of null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that is always resolved with the value `undefined`, instead of resolving to the property value of the provided object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.get` method would return a promise that is always resolved with the `Q` object itself, instead of resolving to the property value of the provided object.

DONE.
