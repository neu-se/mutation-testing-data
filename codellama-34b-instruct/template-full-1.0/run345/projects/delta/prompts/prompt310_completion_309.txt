  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 1: 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an object with a single key-value pair, whereas the original code fragment created an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ foo: bar }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an object with a single key-value pair, whereas the original code fragment created an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 2 + 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an object with a single key-value pair, whereas the original code fragment created an empty object.

DONE.
