  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), while the `isInfinite` function checks if a value is infinite. This means that if the divisor is NaN, the result of the division would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function checks if a value is zero, while the `isInfinite` function checks if a value is infinite. This means that if the divisor is zero, the result of the division would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` function checks if a value is infinite, while the `this` keyword refers to the current object. This means that if the current object is infinite, the result of the division would be different.
