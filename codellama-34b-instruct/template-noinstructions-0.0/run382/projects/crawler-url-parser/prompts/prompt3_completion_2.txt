  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the variable, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, `currentUrlStr` is a string, so `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` would return `false`, while `currentUrlStr === undefined` would return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` checks for equality after converting the operands to the same type, while `===` checks for strict equality. In this case, `currentUrlStr` is a string, so `currentUrlStr == null` would return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is `null` or `undefined`, while `currentUrlStr === null` would only return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
