  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `desiredLines` array would be reversed before being joined into a string, which would result in a different final string than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.shift().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `desiredLines` array would have its first element removed (using the `shift()` method) before being joined into a string, which would result in a different final string than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.pop().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `desiredLines` array would have its last element removed (using the `pop()` method) before being joined into a string, which would result in a different final string than the original code.

DONE.
