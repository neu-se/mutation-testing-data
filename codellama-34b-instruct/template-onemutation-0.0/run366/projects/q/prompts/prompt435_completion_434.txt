  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and the `typeof` operator would return the string "function" if it is called on a function. However, in the original code, `process.emit` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "undefined".

DONE.
