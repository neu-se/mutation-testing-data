  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets the value of a key in the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value of a key in the data object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a key from the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value of a key in the data object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that clears all the key-value pairs from the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value of a key in the data object.

DONE.
