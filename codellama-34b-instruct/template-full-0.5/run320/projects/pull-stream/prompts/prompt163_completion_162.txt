  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(Boolean).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment filters the array to remove any falsy values and then checks if the resulting array has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.some(function(element) { return !element; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if any element in the array is falsy.

DONE.
