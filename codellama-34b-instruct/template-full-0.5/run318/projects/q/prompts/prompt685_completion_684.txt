  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function takes a start index and a length, but the original code used `arguments` which is an array-like object containing all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[].slice.call` method is a more concise way to convert an array-like object to an array, but it would still produce the same result as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is a method of the `Array.prototype` and can be used to extract a subset of an array. However, it would not work in this case because `arguments` is not an array, but an array-like object.

DONE.
