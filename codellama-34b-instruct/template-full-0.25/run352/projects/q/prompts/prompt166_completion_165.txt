  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to miss certain elements or to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the index by 1 instead of 2, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely or to skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
