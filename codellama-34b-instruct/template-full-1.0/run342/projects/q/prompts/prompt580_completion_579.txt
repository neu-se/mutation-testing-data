  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` when trying to invoke it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a string and would not be interpreted as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would throw an `Error` when invoked, which would cause the generator to throw an exception and propagate it to the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)()`.

DONE.
