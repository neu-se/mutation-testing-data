  Thank you for the response. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(random())
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new random number each time the function is called, which could cause the file to be written to a different location or name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { format: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies the file encoding as 'utf8', which could cause the file to be written with a different encoding than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pipeTo(dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method than the original code fragment to write the file. The `pipeTo` method is not provided by the `fs` module and would cause an error if used.

DONE.
