  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\r` matches carriage returns, whereas the original regular expression `\n` matches line feeds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\r\n` matches both carriage returns and line feeds, whereas the original regular expression `\n` only matches line feeds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[\r\n]+/g` matches one or more occurrences of either carriage returns or line feeds, whereas the original regular expression `\n` only matches line feeds.

DONE.
