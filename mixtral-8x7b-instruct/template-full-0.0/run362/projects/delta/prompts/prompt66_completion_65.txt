 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert an operation, even if the length is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only insert an operation if the length is negative, which is not possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only insert an operation if the length is greater than 100, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
