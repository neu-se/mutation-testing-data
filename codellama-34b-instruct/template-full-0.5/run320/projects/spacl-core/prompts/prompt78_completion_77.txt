  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the `rules` array to be iterated in reverse order, potentially causing the `matches()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would cause the `rules` array to be iterated starting from the second element, potentially causing the `matches()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter(r => r.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would cause the `rules` array to be iterated and only include elements that match the specified criteria, potentially causing the `matches()` method to return a different result.

DONE.
