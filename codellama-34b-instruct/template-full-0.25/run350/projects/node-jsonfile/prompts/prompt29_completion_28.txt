  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional string `'bug'` would be appended to the JSON string, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + '}'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `}` would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `null` would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

DONE.
