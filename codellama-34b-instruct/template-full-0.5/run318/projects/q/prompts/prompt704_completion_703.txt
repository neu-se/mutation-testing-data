  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbind` method to bind the `object` argument as the `this` value for the bound function, rather than the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fbind` method to bind the `object` argument as the `this` value for the bound function, rather than the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```

DONE.
