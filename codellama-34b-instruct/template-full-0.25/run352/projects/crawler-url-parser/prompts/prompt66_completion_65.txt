  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\?/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query on the first occurrence of "?", while the new code fragment splits it on every occurrence of "?".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/&/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query on the first occurrence of "&", while the new code fragment splits it on every occurrence of "&".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/[?&]/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search query on the first occurrence of "?" or "&", while the new code fragment splits it on every occurrence of "?" or "&".

DONE.
