  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a reference to the arguments object of the current function, whereas `1` is just a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a reference to the arguments object of the current function, whereas `"hello"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a reference to the arguments object of the current function, whereas `null` is a null value.

DONE.
