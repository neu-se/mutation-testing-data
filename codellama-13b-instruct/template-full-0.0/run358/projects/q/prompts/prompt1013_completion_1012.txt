  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function onto the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function onto the `nodeArgs` array and then calls the `makeNodeResolver` method on the `deferred` object. This would result in a different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function onto the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function onto the `nodeArgs` array and then calls the `makeNodeResolver` method on the `deferred` object. This would result in a different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called in the original code fragment.
