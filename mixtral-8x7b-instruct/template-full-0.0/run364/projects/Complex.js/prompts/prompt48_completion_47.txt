 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a['abs'] > 1e10 && a['arg'] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute value is greater than 1e10 instead of checking if it's not finite, and also checks if 'arg' is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!Number.isInteger(a['abs']) && a['arg'] !== undefined
