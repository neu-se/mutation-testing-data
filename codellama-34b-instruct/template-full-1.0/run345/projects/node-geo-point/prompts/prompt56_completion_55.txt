  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sin() function has a different range of values than the cos() function, which could affect the results of the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the tan() function has a different range of values than the cos() function, which could affect the results of the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log
```
This would result in different behavior because the log() function has a different range of values than the cos() function, which could affect the results of the calculations.

DONE.
