  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

DONE.
