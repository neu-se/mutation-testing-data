  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now incremented by 1, which could cause the `if(i > max)` condition to be evaluated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is now decremented by 1, which could cause the `if(i > max)` condition to be evaluated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is now incremented by 1, which could cause the `if(i > max)` condition to be evaluated differently.

DONE.
