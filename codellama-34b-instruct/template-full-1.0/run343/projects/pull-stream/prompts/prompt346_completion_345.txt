  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.exec()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec` method, which returns an array-like object containing the matched results, would be called without passing any arguments. In the original code, the `exec` method is called with the `data` argument, which contains the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.exec(data[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec` method would be called with the first element of the input data (`data[0]`) instead of the whole input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.exec(data[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec` method would be called with the value of the `key` property of the input data (`data[key]`) instead of the whole input data.

DONE.
