  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolutionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name has changed from "unhandledRejection" to "resolutionHandled", which would result in a different event being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at + 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable has been incremented by 1, which would result in the wrong reason being accessed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable has been incremented by 1, which would result in a different promise being used to track the rejection.

DONE.
