  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` is the inverse tangent function, which returns the arc tangent of a single operand, whereas `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which returns the arc cosine of a single operand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, which returns the arc sine of a single operand, whereas `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which returns the arc cosine of a single operand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which returns the tangent of a single operand, whereas `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which returns the arc cosine of a single operand.

DONE.
