  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fromCallback` method without passing any arguments, which would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fromPromise` method without passing any arguments, which would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async (fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `readFile` method without passing any arguments, which would likely cause a runtime error.

DONE.
