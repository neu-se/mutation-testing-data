  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different property than `op.insert`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op.insert` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different property than `op.insert`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op.insert` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is a different property than `op.insert`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op.insert` is truthy.

DONE.
