  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cb` will negate the truthiness of `cb`, which means that the function will be called with `null` instead of `cb` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb + 1` will add `1` to the value of `cb`, which means that the function will be called with a different argument if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb * 2` will multiply the value of `cb` by `2`, which means that the function will be called with a different argument if `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
