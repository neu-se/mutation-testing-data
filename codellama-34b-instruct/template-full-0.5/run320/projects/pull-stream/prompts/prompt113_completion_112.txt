  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `cb` with one argument, but this new code fragment calls it with two arguments, which could cause the callback to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `cb` with one argument, but this new code fragment calls it with two arguments, which could cause the callback to behave differently. Additionally, the second argument `null` is different from the original code, which could also cause issues.
