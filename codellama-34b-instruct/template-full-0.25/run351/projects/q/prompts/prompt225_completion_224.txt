  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method starting from the second argument, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method starting from the third argument, instead of passing all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method starting from the fourth argument, instead of passing all the arguments.

DONE.
