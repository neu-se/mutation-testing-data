  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement instead of incrementing the variable `i`, which would cause the loop to terminate early or skip some iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to iterate twice as fast and potentially miss some iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would multiply `i` by 2 instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to iterate at a different rate and potentially miss some iterations.

DONE.
