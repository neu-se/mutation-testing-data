  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the zoom level by +1, resulting in a different tile location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the zoom level by -1, resulting in a different tile location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the zoom level by 1/2, resulting in a different tile location.

DONE.
