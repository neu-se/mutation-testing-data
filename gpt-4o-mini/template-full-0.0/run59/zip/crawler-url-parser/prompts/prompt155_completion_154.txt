Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"not_samelevel"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify the URL relationship as "not_samelevel" instead of returning "samelevel" when the paths are actually the same, leading to potential misclassification of internal links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire `linkurl_path` instead of an empty string, which would cause the function to incorrectly identify the relationship between the URLs, potentially classifying them as "internal" when they should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path + "/extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append "/extra" to the `pageurl_path`, causing the function to incorrectly evaluate the URL relationship, potentially classifying a URL as "sublevel" when it should be "samelevel" or "internal".

DONE.
