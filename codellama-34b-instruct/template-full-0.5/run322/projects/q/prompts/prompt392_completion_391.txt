Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, progressed, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially affect the behavior of the `when` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially affect the behavior of the `when` method.
