  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "allResolved" to refer to the `allResolved` function, but the replacement code fragment uses "allRejected" to refer to the `allRejected` function. This would cause the `allSettled` function to incorrectly resolve the promise with an array of rejected promises, rather than an array of resolved or rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "allResolved" to refer to the `allResolved` function, but the replacement code fragment uses "allSettled" to refer to the `allSettled` function. This would cause the `allSettled` function to incorrectly resolve the promise with an array of resolved or rejected promises, rather than an array of settled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
