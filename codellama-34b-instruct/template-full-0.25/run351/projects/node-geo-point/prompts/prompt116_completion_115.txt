  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing + 180);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is offset by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is doubled, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing - 90);
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is offset by 90 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
