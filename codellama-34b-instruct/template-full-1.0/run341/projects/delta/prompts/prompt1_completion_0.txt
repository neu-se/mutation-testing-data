  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function expects `a` to be an object, but `a == null` would evaluate to `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function expects `a` to be an object, but `Object.keys(a).length > 0` would evaluate to `true` if `a` is an empty object, which would cause the function to return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function expects `a` to be an object, but `Array.isArray(a)` would evaluate to `true` if `a` is an array, which would cause the
