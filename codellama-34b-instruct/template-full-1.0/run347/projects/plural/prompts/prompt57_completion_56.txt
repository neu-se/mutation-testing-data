  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'verifies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would replace any instance of "ves" with "verifies," which would change the output of the function for words that match the "s/es" rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'is'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would replace any instance of "ves" with "is," which would also change the output of the function for words that match the "s/es" rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would replace any instance of "ves" with an empty string, which would cause the function to return an incorrect output for words that match the "s/es" rule.

DONE.
