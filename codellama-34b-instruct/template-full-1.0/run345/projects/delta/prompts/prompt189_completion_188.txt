  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the `attributes` property if they exist and are not empty, whereas the original code would always set the `attributes` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes && op.attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the `attributes` property if they exist and are empty, whereas the original code would always set the `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op.attributes && op.insert == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the `attributes` property if they do not exist and the `insert` property is null, whereas the original code would always set the `attributes` property.

DONE.
