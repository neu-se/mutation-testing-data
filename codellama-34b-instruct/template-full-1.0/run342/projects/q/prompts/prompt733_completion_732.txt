  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(promises)` will cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `promises`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value `promises` wrapped in a `Q` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all(promises)` will cause the promise to be fulfilled with an array of promises, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled with a single promise.

DONE.
