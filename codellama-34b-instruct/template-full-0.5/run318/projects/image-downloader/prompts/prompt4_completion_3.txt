  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if the `options.url` is falsy, rather than if `options.dest` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if `options.dest` is null, rather than if `options.dest` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.dest === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if `options.dest` is undefined, rather than if `options.dest` is falsy.

DONE.
