  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `otherOp.retain` argument, which is not the same as the original code that called the `getHandler` method on the `otherOp` object with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `thisOp.retain` argument, which is not the same as the original code that called the `getHandler` method on the `otherOp` object with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `otherOp` object as
