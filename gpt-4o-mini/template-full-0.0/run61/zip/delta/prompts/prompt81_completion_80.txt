Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the new operation to the end of the `ops` array instead of inserting it at the beginning, potentially altering the order of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, but using `splice` instead of `unshift` could lead to performance differences and may not be the intended method for adding elements to the front of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first operation from the `ops` array instead of adding the new operation, which would lead to a loss of data and potentially incorrect state in the `Delta` object.

DONE.
