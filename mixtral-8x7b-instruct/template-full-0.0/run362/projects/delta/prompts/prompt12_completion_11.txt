 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks for null values in `a` instead of undefined, which might cause some cases to pass when they should fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a.hasOwnProperty(key) && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` has the property `key` instead of just checking the value, which might cause some cases to pass when they should fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key in a && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `key` is a key in `a` using the `in` operator, which might cause some cases to pass when they should fail.

DONE.
