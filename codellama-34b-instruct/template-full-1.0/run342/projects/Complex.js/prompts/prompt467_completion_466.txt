  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a == 0```
This would result in different behavior because a and b are swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b != 0```
This would result in different behavior because the equality check would be negated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a <= 0```
This would result in different behavior because a is checked if it's less than or equal to 0.

DONE.
