  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `stackLine` variable to the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine, fileNameAndLineNumber)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `stackLine` and `fileNameAndLineNumber` variables to the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
