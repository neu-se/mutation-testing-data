  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding one to the length of the op, which would cause the delete operation to remove one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting one from the length of the op, which would cause the delete operation to remove one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be doubling the length of the op, which would cause the delete operation to remove twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
