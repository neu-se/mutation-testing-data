  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if a property exists on an object, but it does not check if the property is inherited from the object's prototype. By using `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')`, we ensure that the property is checked on the object itself, and not on its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' in object
```
This would result in different behavior because `'latitude' in object` checks if the property is present on the object, but it does not check if the property is an own property of the object. By using `object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')`, we ensure that the property is an own property of the object, and not inherited from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty
