Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would not have the '$' character escaped, potentially leading to incorrect path resolution if the target path contains '$' characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be a concatenation of the current path and the target path, rather than replacing the current path with the target path, potentially leading to incorrect file copying.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath.replace(/./g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be an empty string, effectively removing the file name from the path, potentially leading to errors when trying to copy files to a non-existent directory.

DONE.
