  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var inspected = <object>;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the newly created `object` instead of the `Promise` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var inspected = this.inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is called on the newly created `promise` instead of the `Promise` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var inspected = inspect(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `promise` instead of the `Promise` instance.

DONE.
