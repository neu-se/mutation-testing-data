  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@filename"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different value, which could affect the filtering of stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@lineNumber"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different value, which could affect the filtering of stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"@columnNumber"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different value, which could affect the filtering of stack traces.

DONE.
