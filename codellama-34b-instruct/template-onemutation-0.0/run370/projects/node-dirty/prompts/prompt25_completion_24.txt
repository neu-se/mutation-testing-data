  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if it is defined, while the new code fragment would call the `cb` function unconditionally, which could cause the function to be called with an undefined value if it is not defined.
