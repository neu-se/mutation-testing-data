  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the task property of the head node to undefined, which would cause the while loop to exit after the first iteration, even if there are more tasks in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the task property of the head node to null, which would cause the while loop to exit after the first iteration, even if there are more tasks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.next = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the next property of the head node to null, which would cause the while loop to exit after the first iteration, even if there are more tasks in the queue.

DONE.
