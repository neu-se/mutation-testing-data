  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called instead of the `regardless` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of the `regardless` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error instead of being resolved or rejected based on the original code.

DONE.
