  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the length of the operation is being passed as an argument to the `length` function, which is a method of the `Delta` class and returns the length of the operation. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `1` would cause the length of the operation to be hardcoded as `1`, which could cause bugs or errors if the operation's length is not actually `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the length of the operation is being passed as an argument to the `length` function, which is a method of the `Delta` class and returns the length of the operation. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `null` would cause the length of the operation to be `null`, which could cause bugs or errors if the operation is not actually of length `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
