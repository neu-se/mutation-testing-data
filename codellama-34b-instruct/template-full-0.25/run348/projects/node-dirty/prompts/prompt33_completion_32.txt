  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted from the map, while `null` would not delete the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted from the map, while an empty string would not delete the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted from the map, while `0` would not delete the key.

DONE.
