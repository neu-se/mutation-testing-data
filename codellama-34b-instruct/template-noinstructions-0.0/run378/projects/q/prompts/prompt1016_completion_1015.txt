  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());`, which passes no arguments to `makeNodeResolver`. Passing `null` as an argument would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());`, which passes no arguments to `makeNodeResolver`. Passing `undefined` as an argument would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {}));
```
