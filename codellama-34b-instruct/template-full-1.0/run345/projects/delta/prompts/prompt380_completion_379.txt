  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator and increments the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.shift()` removes and returns the first operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator and increments the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.pop()` removes and returns the last operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator and increments the index.

DONE.
