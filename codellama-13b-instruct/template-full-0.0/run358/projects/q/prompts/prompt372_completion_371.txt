  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs in a promise, and it is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror(exception)` is a function that is called when an error occurs in a promise, and it is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(exception, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror(exception, promise)` is a function that is called when an error occurs in a promise, and it is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
