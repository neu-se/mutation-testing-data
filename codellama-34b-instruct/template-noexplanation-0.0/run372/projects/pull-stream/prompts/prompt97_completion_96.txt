  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `ended`. The original code fragment will always evaluate to `true` if `ended` is `true`, but the new code fragment will evaluate to `false` if `ended` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `ended`. The original code fragment will always evaluate to `true` if `ended` is `true`, but the new code fragment will evaluate to `false` if `ended` is `true` and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This code fragment has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `ended`. The original code fragment will always evaluate to `true` if `ended` is `true`, but the new code fragment will evaluate to `true` if `ended` is `true` or `true
