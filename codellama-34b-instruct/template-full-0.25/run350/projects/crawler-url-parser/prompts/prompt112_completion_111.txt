  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null` instead of the expected URL object, which could cause errors in the code that uses this variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "https://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a hardcoded URL instead of the expected URL object, which could cause errors in the code that uses this variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = URL.parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to the result of calling `URL.parse()` on the `baseUrlStr` variable, which could cause errors in the code that uses this variable if the `baseUrlStr` variable is not a valid URL.

DONE.
