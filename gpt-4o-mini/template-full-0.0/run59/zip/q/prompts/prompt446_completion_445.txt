Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last promise from the `unhandledRejections` array instead of adding the current promise to the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.unshift(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the promise to the beginning of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the end, which could lead to a different order of handling reported rejections and potentially cause issues in the order of events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first promise from the `unhandledRejections` array instead of adding the current promise to the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would disrupt the tracking of unhandled rejections and could lead to missed notifications.

DONE.
