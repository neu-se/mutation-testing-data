  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause an error when attempting to call `pull.apply(undefined, ref)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and would not have a `source` property, which would cause an error when attempting to call `read.source`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and would cause an error when attempting to use it as a function or object.

DONE.
