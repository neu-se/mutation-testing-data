Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to always attempt to retrieve the next operation starting from index 0, potentially skipping over operations that should be processed if the `start` parameter is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue fetching operations until the `end` index is reached, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error if `end` exceeds the length of the operations array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always fetch only one operation at a time, which could lead to incorrect slicing of the operations if the `start` and `end` parameters are not handled properly, potentially resulting in missing operations in the final output.

DONE.
