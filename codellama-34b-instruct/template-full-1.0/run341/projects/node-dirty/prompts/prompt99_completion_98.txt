  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
debugger;
```
This would result in different behavior because `debugger;` is a statement that will trigger the debugger, halting the execution of the code. The original code does not have this statement, so the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Corrupted row!');
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that will raise an exception. The original code does not have this statement, so the behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row!'));
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row!')); is a statement that will emit an error event. The original code does not have this statement, so the behavior would be different.

DONE.
