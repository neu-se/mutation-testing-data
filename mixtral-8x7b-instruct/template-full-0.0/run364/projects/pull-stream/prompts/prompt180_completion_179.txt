 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would not be called when the user aborts the operation, and the callback would always receive `null` as the first argument instead of the expected `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable `i` would be passed to `abortCb` instead of the abort flag. This could potentially cause the function to behave unexpectedly, depending on the implementation of `abortCb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Aborting...')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error object would be passed to `abortCb` instead of a boolean value. This could cause the function to throw an exception, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code.

DONE.
