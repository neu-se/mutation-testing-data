  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which has a different range and behavior than `cosh`, the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is a method that calculates the hyperbolic sine of a number, while `cosh` is a function that calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is a method that calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while `cosh` is a function that calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
