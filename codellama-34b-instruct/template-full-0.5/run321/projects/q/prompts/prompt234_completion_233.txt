  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a promise, and therefore the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a promise, and therefore the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable is not a promise, and therefore the `promiseDispatch` method would not be called on it.

DONE.
