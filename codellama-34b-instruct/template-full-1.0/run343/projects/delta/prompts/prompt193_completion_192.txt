  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, not the iterator itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.index
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.index` returns the current position of the iterator, not the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns a deep copy of the next element in the iterator, not the iterator itself.

DONE.
