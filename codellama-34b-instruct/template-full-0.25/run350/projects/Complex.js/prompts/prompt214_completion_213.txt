  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive `a` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code where `b` was passed as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive `a + b` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code where `b` was passed as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive `b * a` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code where `b` was passed as the second argument.

DONE.
