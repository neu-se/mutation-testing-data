  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always keep null values in the attributes object, regardless of the `keepNull` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove null values from the attributes object, regardless of the `keepNull` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull && attributes[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only keep null values in the attributes object if the `keepNull` parameter is true and the value of the attribute is not null.

DONE.
