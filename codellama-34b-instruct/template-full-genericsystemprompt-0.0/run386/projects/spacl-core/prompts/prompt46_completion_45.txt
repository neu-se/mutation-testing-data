  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire part string against the regular expression, rather than just the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire part string against the regular expression, and then return the first match, rather than just the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire part string against the regular expression, and then return the second match, rather than just the first character.

DONE.
