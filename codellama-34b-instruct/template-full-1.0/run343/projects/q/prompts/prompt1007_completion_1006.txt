  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this.length` would change the result from a slice of an array to the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because using the number `5` would change the result from a slice of an array to the number `5`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because using the string `"hello"` would change the result from a slice of an array to the string `"hello"`.

DONE.
