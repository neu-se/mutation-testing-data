  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the specified number of elements from the original array, starting from the specified index. In this case, it would return a new array with the longitude value as the first element, which would cause the `fromLngLatArray()` method to interpret the latitude and longitude values in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array with the specified elements added to the end of the original array. In this case,
