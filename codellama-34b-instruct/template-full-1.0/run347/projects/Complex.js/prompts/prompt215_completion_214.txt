  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code fragment uses the multiplication operator, which returns the product of both operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which returns the second operand, whereas the new code fragment uses the subtraction operator, which returns the difference between both operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which returns the second operand, whereas the new code fragment uses the addition operator, which returns the sum of both operands.

DONE.
