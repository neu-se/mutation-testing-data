  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would now be matching the wrong case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would now be matching a different case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would now be skipping over the case without a `break` statement.

DONE.
