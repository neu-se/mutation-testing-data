  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the result of the `fulfilled` function instead of the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the result of the `fulfilled` function instead of resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the result of the `fulfilled` function instead of resolving or rejecting it.

DONE.
