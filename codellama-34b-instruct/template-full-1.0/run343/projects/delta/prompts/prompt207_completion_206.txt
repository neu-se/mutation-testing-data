  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an object with a `delete` property, but `null` does not have such a property. This would cause the program to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an object with a `delete` property, but `true` does not have such a property. This would cause the program to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an object with a `delete` property, but `false` does not have such a property. This would cause the program to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
