  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.push` method mutates the `args` array, while `args.concat` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.concat` method returns a new array, while `args.push` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0).concat(array_slice(arguments, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.slice` method creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, while `args.concat` does not.

DONE.
