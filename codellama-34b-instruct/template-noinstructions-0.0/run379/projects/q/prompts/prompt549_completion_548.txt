  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a function, so it would throw an error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a promise, so it would not have a `done` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a promise, so it would not have a `then` method.

DONE.
