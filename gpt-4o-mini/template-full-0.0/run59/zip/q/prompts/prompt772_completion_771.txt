Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of an array will cause the `allSettled` function to attempt to resolve `null`, which is not a valid input, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` will cause the `allSettled` function to treat it as an empty array, which may lead to the promise resolving immediately without any states being inspected, differing from the intended behavior of inspecting the states of the promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `"invalid"` will cause the `allSettled` function to treat it as a single promise, which is not an array, leading to incorrect handling of the promise states and potentially causing the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
