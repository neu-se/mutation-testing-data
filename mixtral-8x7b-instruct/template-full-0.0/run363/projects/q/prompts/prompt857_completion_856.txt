 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start a new timeout instead of clearing the existing one, causing the promise to eventually reject even if the original timeout would have been cleared in time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because it is used to clear intervals, not timeouts. This would not have any effect on the existing timeout, causing the promise to eventually reject even if the original timeout would have been cleared in time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise, bypassing the timeout mechanism entirely. This could cause issues if the promise's resolution depends on the timeout being properly handled.

DONE.
