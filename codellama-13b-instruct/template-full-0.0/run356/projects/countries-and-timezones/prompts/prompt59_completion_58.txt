  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is an empty object, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { name: 'United States' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is an object with a `name` property set to `'United States'`, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a country object with a different name than the expected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { name: 'United States', timezones: ['America/New_York'] })
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is an object with a `name` property set to `'United States'` and a `timezones` property set to `['America/New_Y
