  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split().reverse()
```
This would result  in different behavior because the `split()` method with no arguments splits the string on whitespace, while the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns its length, while the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, while the `split()` method splits the string into an array of substrings.

DONE.
