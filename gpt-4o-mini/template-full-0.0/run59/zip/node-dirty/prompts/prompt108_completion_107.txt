Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the buffer is an empty string instead of checking its length, which would not trigger the error for a non-empty buffer that might still be corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data store is empty rather than checking the length of the buffer, which could lead to a false assumption that there are no corrupted rows when there might be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it only triggers the error if the buffer length exceeds 10 characters, potentially ignoring shorter corrupted rows that should also be flagged.

DONE.
