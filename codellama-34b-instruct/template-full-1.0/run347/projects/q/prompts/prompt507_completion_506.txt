  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value2, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.apply()` expects the value to be the first argument, but the replaced code references `args` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.apply()` expects an array of arguments starting from index 1, but the replaced code refers to `args2` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.apply()` expects an array of arguments starting from index 1, but the replaced code references `args[0]` as the second argument, which is the first element of the array `args`.

DONE.
