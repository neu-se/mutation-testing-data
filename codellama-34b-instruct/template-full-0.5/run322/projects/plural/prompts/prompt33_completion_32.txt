  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring starting from the second character instead of the first character, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring ending at the third-to-last character instead of the second-to-last character, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(w.length - 2, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring starting from the second-to-last character and ending at the last character instead of starting from the first character and ending at the second-to-last character, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
