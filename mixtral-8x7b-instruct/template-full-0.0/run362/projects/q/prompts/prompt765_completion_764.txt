 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would receive a resolved promise instead of the original promise, potentially causing the `onRejected` function not to be called when the original promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or a value, and `null` is not a promise or a value, potentially causing the function to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
