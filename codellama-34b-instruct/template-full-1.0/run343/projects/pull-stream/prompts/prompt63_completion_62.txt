  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` has higher precedence than `||`, so the order of operations would be different. In the original code, if `end` is falsy, it would be overwritten with the value of `abort`, but with the modified code, `end` would only be overwritten if `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = (end || abort) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force `end` to be a boolean value, whereas the original code allows it to be any falsy or truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = (end || abort) ? end : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the ternary operator to replace the value of `end` with the value of `abort` if `end` is falsy, whereas the original code
