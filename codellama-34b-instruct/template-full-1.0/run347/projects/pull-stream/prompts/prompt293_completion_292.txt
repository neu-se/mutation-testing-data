  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `test` is a number, while the new code is checking if it is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `test` is a number, while the new code is checking if it is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof test === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `test` is a number, while the new code is checking if it is an object.

DONE.
