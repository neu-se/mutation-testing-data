  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on `this` object from `post` to `get`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on `this` object from `post` to `put`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on `this` object from `post` to `delete`.

DONE.
