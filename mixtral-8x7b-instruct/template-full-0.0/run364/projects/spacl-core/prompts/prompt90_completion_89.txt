 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the `policies` array using `const` instead of `let`, creating a new reference to the `policy` on each iteration, which might not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < policies.length; i++) {
  const policy = policies[i];
  this.set(policy.name, policy);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a traditional `for` loop with an index instead of the `for...of` loop, which might have unintended side effects if the order of the elements in the `policies` array matters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const policy of policies.slice()) {
  this.set(policy.name, policy);
}
```
