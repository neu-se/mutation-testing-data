  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with only the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with only the `data` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
