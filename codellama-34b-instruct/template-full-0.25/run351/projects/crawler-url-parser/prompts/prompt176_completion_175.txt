  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.href` is a different property than `url`, and it may not be a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.protocol + url.host + url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the protocol, host, and pathname of the URL, which may not be a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.searchParams.get("url")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the value of the "url" query parameter, which may not be a valid URL.

DONE.
