  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/(.+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` quantifier matches one or more characters, whereas the `*` quantifier matches zero or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/[^/]+?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` quantifier makes the `+` quantifier non-greedy, which means it matches the minimum number of characters instead of the maximum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\+` in the original code fragment is replaced with a `\d` in this option, which makes the matcher match only digits instead of any characters.

DONE.
