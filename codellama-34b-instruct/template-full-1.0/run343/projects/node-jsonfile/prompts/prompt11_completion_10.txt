  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string as its first argument, but `data` may be an object or an array, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string as its first argument, but `data[0]` may be a string, an object, or an array, which would cause a type error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse()` expects a string as its first argument, but `data + 1` would return a number, which would cause a type error.

DONE.
