  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second and third arguments to `URL.parse()` have been changed from `true` to `false`, meaning that the method will not remove the directory index and will not remove trailing slashes from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second and third arguments to `URL.parse()` have been changed from `true` to `null`, meaning that the method will use the default values for those arguments instead of the provided values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(embedBaseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `URL.parse()` has been changed from `currentUrlStr` to `embedBaseUrlStr`, meaning that the method will be parsing a different URL than the original code. Additionally
