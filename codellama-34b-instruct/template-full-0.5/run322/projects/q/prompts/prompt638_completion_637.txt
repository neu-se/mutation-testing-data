  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the `value` variable as the second argument to the `delete` method, which is not the same as passing the `key` variable as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `delete` method, which would cause the method to delete the property with the given key, rather than setting it to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to the `delete` method, which would cause the method to set the property with the given key to `undefined`, rather than deleting it.

DONE.
