  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this replacement returns the reason as a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this replacement returns a new error object with the reason as the message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Reason: " + reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this replacement throws a new error object with the reason as the message.

DONE.
