  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the case of the `name` variable, potentially causing the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `name` variable with the string `'foo'`, potentially causing the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would change the order of the characters in the `name` variable, potentially causing the `buildTimezone` function to return a different result.

DONE.
