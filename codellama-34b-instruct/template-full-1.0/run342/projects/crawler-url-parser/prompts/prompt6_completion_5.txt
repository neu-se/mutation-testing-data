  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the protocol of the URL, while this code fragment does. Therefore, it could cause the URL parsing to fail or return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the protocol of the base URL, while this code fragment does. Therefore, it could cause the base URL parsing to fail or return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the entire URL, while this code fragment only checks the first part of the URL. Therefore, it could cause the URL parsing to fail or return a different result.

DONE.
