 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result would always be 0, even when it should be non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the input's imaginary part is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the result's imaginary part would become a random value, instead of being calculated from the input.

DONE.
