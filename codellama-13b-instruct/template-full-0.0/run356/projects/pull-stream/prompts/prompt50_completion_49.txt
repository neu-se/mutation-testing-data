  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is being negated, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `s` is a function, and the code inside the `if` block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` variable is being compared to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `s` is `null`, and the code inside the `if` block would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `s` variable is being compared to `0`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `s` variable is an empty array, and the code inside the `if` block would
