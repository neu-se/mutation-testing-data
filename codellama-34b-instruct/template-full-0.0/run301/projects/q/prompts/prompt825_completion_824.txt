  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original `promise` object, but on a new promise returned by the `then` method. This could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return Q.reject(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a function that returns a rejected promise with the same value as the original promise.
