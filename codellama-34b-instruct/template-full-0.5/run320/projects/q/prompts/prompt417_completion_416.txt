  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a function and needs to be called to return the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would return `undefined` because `inspect` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` is a method that creates a new function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it would return a new function that would not have the same behavior as the original `inspect` function.

DONE.
