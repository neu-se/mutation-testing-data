  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is no longer a reference to the `Complex` object, but rather a reference to the variable `b`, which may or may not have the same value as `a['re']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im']` is a different variable than `z['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im'] + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression is now adding an extra term to the original expression.

DONE.
