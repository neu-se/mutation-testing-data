 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy node resolver'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error in the resolver function would cause the returned promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the timeout specified in the `setTimeout` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because directly calling `deferred.resolve` would immediately resolve the promise, rather than waiting for the timeout specified in the `setTimeout` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because directly calling `deferred.reject` would immediately reject the promise, rather than waiting for the timeout specified in the `setTimeout` call.

DONE.
