  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `type` function to determine the type of a value, but the modified code uses the `toLowerCase` method on the `type` function, which would always return the string "function" regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof type
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `type` function to determine the type of a value, but the modified code uses the `typeof` operator to determine the type of the `type` function itself, which would always return the string "function" regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.call(null, word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `type` function to determine the type of a value, but the modified code uses the `call` method on the `type` function to call it with a different context
