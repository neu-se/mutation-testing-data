  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different operation than `op.retain`, and it would cause the `retain` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different operation than `op.retain`, and it would cause the `retain` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to retain one more character than it should, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
