  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self.promiseDispatch` function is called with a different set of arguments than the original code. Specifically, the `self.promiseDispatch` function is called with the `resolve` function as the first argument, which is not the case in the original code. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nextTick` function is called with a different set of arguments than the original code. Specifically, the `Q.nextTick` function is called with a function that calls the `self.promiseDispatch` function with a different set of arguments than the original code. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because
