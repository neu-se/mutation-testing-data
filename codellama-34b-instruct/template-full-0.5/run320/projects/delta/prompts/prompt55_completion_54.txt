  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the code to behave differently when the `ops` parameter is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isObject` is not a valid method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) || Array.isObject(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the code to treat the `ops` parameter as an array or an object, regardless of its actual type.

DONE.
