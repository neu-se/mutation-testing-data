  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a rejected promise, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a promise that resolves to `undefined`, causing the `fulfilled` callback to be called with `undefined` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a promise that resolves to `null`, causing the `fulfilled` callback to be called with `null` as its argument.

DONE.
