 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...base.ops].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from `base.ops` using the spread operator, which may have unintended side effects if the `ops` property is not an array or if modifying the copy affects the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.slice.bind(base)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound function of `slice`, which may not behave the same as the original `slice` method when called with arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.ops.filter(op => op.insert).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the `ops` array to only include elements with the `insert` property before slicing, which may not match the original behavior if there are other types of operations in the array.

DONE.
