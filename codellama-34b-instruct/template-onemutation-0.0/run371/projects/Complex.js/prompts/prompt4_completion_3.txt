  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential function, while the replaced code fragment uses the `x * x` operation, which computes the square of `x`. The `Math.exp` function is more accurate and robust than the `x * x` operation, especially for large values of `x`.

DONE.
