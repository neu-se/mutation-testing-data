  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a different function from `_progressed` and would be called with the same arguments, which could lead to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a different function from `_progressed` and would be called with the same arguments, which could lead to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error('test'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is called with a different argument, which could lead to a different outcome.

DONE.
