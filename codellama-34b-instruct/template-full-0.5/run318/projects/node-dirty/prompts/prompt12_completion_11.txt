  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the uppercase version of the key, which could cause issues if the key is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "xyz"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the string "xyz" to the key, which could cause issues if the key is used as a file path or other type of identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to null, which could cause issues if the value is used as a condition for other operations.

DONE.
