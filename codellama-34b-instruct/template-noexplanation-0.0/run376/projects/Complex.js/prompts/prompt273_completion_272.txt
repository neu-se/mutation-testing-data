  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This change will cause the `arg` method to return the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which may cause errors in the calculation of the magnitude and angle of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `arg` method to return the real part of the complex number plus one, which may cause errors in the calculation of the magnitude and angle of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `arg` method to return the imaginary part of the complex number plus one, which may cause errors in the calculation of the magnitude and angle of the complex number.

DONE.
