  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push({ insert: `a random string` });
```
This would result in different behavior because the inserted string is different from the original code, which was `newOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the pushed value is `null`, which is different from the original code, which was `newOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push({ delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the pushed value is an object with a `delete` property, which is different from the original code, which was an object with an `insert` property.
