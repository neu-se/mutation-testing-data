  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be shifted by one, causing the `thisp` argument to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be shifted by one, causing the `thisp` argument to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument, causing the `thisp` argument to be skipped.

DONE.
