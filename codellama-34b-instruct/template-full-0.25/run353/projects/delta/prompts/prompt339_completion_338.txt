  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `base` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would not be changed, which would cause the `slice` method to return the same subset of the `base` Delta.

DONE.
