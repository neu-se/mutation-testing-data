  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress.bind(null)` would return a new function that is not the same as the original `progress` function, which could cause the `done` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the `progress` argument, which could cause the `done` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, function (value) { return value * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a function that returns the value multiplied by 2 would be passed as the `progress` argument, which could cause the `done` method to behave differently.

DONE.
