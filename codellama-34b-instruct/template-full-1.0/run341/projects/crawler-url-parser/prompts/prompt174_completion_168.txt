  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose, Foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the string being logged, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose, Foo" + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the string "test" to the original string, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose, Foo" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the number 1 to the original string, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
