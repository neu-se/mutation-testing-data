  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to end with an error, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would not emit any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to end without any error, whereas the original code would emit an error if the `destroy` method was called with a non-null argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to end without any error, whereas the original code would emit an error if the `destroy` method was called with a non-null argument.
