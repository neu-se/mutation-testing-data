  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min
```
This would result in different behavior because the `min` variable is not related to the `offset` and the function call would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would return a different value that includes an additional hour.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-hours
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would return a different value that is opposite in sign to the original value.

DONE.
