  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method is not called in the original code, which means that the write stream is not corked, and data is written to the stream immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method is not called in the original code, which means that the write stream is not ended, and data is written to the stream indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is not called in the original code, which means that the write stream is not destroyed, and data is written to the stream normally.

DONE.
