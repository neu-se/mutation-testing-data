  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname.split('/').pop()` would return the last segment of the path, whereas `pathname` would return the entire path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname.substr(1)` would return the path without the leading slash, whereas `pathname` would return the entire path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname.replace(/\//g, '')` would return the path with all slashes removed, whereas `pathname` would return the entire path.

DONE.
