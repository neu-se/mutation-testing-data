  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This will create a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, which can be used to store the callbacks in the `_queue` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat()
```
This will create a new array that contains the elements of the `cbs` array, which can be used to store the callbacks in the `_queue` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map(cb => cb)
```
This will create a new array that contains the callbacks in the `cbs` array, which can be used to store the callbacks in the `_queue` map.

DONE.
