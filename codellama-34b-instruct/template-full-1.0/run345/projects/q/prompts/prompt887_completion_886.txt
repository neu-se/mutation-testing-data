  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to extract a single element from the `arguments` array, instead of extracting all the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to extract an empty array, instead of extracting all the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to extract an empty object, instead of extracting all the elements.

DONE.
