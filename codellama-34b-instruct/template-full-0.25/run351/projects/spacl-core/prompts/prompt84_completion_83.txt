  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0).map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the original array, whereas the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce((acc, rule) => acc.concat(rule.clone()), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element in the
