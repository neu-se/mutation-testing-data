  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise. In the original code, `reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, but replacing it with `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved instead, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

```
throw new Error('Timeout Error')

This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise. In the original code, `reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, but replacing it with `throw` would cause an exception to be thrown instead, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Timeout Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a
