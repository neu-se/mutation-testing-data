  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key + 1` expression would evaluate to a different value than the original `key` expression, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key - 1` expression would evaluate to a different value than the original `key` expression, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key * 2` expression would evaluate to a different value than the original `key` expression, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
