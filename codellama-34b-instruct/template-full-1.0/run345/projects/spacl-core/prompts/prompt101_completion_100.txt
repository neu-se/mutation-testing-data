  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `verb` variable is compared to `'unknown'`. If the `verb` variable is not equal to `'unknown'`, the `policy.query()` method will be called with the `verb` variable as an argument. However, if the `verb` variable is equal to `'unknown'`, the `policy.query()` method will not be called. By replacing the `verb` variable with `'unknown'`, the `policy.query()` method will always be called, regardless of the value of the `verb` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `verb` variable is compared to `null`. If the `verb` variable is not equal to `null`, the `policy.query()` method will be called with the `verb` variable as an argument. However, if the `verb` variable is equal to `null`, the `policy.query()` method will not be called
