  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length, num
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` would return the length of the string, while `this` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1, num
```
This would result in different behavior because `num + 1` would return a different value than `num`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'', num
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be passed as the first argument to the function, which would cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
