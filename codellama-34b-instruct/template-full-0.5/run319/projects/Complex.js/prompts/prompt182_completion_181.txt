  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is used in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] *= 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the real part of the complex number, which is used in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would affect the results of the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
