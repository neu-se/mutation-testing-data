  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = arg;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` would be assigned the value of `arg`, instead of the value of `arg.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = a[embedType];
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` would be assigned the value of the `embedType` property of `a`, instead of the value of `arg`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = b[embedType];
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` would be assigned the value of the `embedType` property of `b`, instead of the value of `arg`.

DONE.
