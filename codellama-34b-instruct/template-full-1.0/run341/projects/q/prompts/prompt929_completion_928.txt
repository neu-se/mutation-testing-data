  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {
    return;
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would execute the method `nbind` on the object `this` with the argument `args`, while this code fragment would immediately return without doing anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete args;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would execute the method `nbind` on the object `this` with the argument `args`, while this code fragment would delete the `args` object, which may cause errors in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would execute the method `nbind` on the object `this` with the argument `args`, while this code fragment would set the `args` object to `null`, which may cause errors in the code that uses it.

DONE.
