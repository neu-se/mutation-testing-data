  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more occurrences of the letter "a" instead of just one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a?/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match zero or one occurrences of the letter "a" instead of just one.

DONE.
