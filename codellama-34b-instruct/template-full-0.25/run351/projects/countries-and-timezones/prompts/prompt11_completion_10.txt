  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(result).forEach((key) => {
  result[key] = { current: [], all: [] };
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `result` object to an empty object, causing the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return an empty object instead of the expected object with country codes as keys and timezone information as values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(result).forEach((value) => {
  value.current = [];
  value.all = [];
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `current` and `all` properties of each object in the `result` object, causing the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return an object with empty `current` and `all` properties instead of the expected object with country codes as keys and timezone information as values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(result).forEach((
