  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `object`, which may not exist or may have different behavior than the original `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `catch` method on the `object`, which may not exist or may have different behavior than the original `catch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `finally` method on the `object`, which may not exist or may have different behavior than the original `finally` method.

DONE.
