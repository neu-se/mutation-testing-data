  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.toString()` method to be called, which would return a string representation of the `process` object, rather than the `process` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method of the `process` object to be called with no arguments, which would return a string representation of the `process` object, rather than the `process` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method of the `process` object to be called with no arguments, which would return a string representation of the `process` object, rather than the `process` object itself.

DONE.
