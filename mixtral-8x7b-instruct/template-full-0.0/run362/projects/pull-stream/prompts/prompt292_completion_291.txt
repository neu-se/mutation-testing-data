 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return true for all non-unique items, instead of only returning true for the second occurrence of an item.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'field', true
