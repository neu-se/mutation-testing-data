 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the argument is flipped, which can change the resulting complex number's argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b, -a
