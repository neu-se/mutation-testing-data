  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is `0`, which would cause the `Math.pow()` function to return `10` instead of `0` if `places` is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would always add `1` to `places`, which would cause the `Math.pow()` function to return a different result if `places` is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would always multiply `places` by `2`, which would cause the `Math.pow()` function to return a different result if `places` is `0`.

DONE.
