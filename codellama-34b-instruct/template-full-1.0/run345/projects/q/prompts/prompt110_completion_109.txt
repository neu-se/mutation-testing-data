  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the current element in the array is not equal to the value, rather than if it is equal to the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value && typeof this[i] === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the current element in the array is not equal to the value and if it is undefined, rather than if it is equal to the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value || this[i] !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the current element in the array is not equal to the value or if it is not undefined, rather than if it is equal to the value.

DONE.
