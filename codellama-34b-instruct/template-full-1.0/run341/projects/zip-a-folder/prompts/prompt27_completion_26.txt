  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.off` event is only emitted when the `output` stream is in the "unpipe" mode. In the original code, the `output.on` event is used to listen for the "close" event, which is emitted when the `output` stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.once` method is used to listen for the "error" event, which is emitted when the `output` stream encounters an error. In the original code, the `output.on` method is used to listen for the "close" event, which is emitted when the `output` stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.emit` method is used to emit a "close
