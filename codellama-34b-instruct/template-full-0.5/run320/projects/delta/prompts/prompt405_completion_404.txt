  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `getHandler` would always return `null`, causing any code that uses it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because `getHandler` would always return `42`, which is not a valid handler and would cause any code that uses it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => "banana";
```
This would result in different behavior because `getHandler` would always return `"banana"`, which is not a valid handler and would cause any code that uses it to fail.

DONE.
