  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the processed text would start at the end of the line, rather than at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the processed text would start at the beginning of the line, rather than at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the processed text would start at the second-to-last character of the line, rather than at the beginning or end.

DONE.
