 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would always return 0, regardless of the input points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would always return the distance between the point (0, 0) and the input point, instead of the actual distance between the two input points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method would return a random value instead of the actual distance between the two input points. This could potentially cause tests to pass even when the code is incorrect, making it difficult to identify and fix bugs.

DONE.
