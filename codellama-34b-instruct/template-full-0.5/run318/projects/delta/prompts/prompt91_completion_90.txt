  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this new code checks if it is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this new code checks if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this new code checks if it is not an object.

DONE.
