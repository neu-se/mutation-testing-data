  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.slice(1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas `data` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.concat([1, 2, 3])` would return a new array with the elements `[1, 2, 3]` added to the end of `data`, whereas `data` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.filter(x => x > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.filter(x => x > 0)` would return a new array with only the elements of `data` that are greater than 0, whereas `data` would return the original array.

DONE.
