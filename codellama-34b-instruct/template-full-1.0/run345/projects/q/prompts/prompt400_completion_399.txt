  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement value is a different type than the original and has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{foo: 42}
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement value is a different type than the original and has a different structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement value is a different type than the original and has a different value.

DONE.
