  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be off by 10 degrees, which could cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance would be doubled, which would cause the destination point to be further away from the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing would be negative, which would cause the destination point to be in the opposite direction.

DONE.
