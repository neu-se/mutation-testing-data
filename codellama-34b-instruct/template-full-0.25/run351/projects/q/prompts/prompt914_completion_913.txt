  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive an empty array-like object, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive an undefined value, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive an empty
