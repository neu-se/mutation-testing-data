 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/criterion/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will always match the string 'criterion', bypassing the original rule-based logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 's' }
