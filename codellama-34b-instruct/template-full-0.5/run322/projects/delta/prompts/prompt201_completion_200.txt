  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(otherIter.rest()).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the rest of the `otherIter` iterator with the `delta` object, which is not the same as concatenating the `rest` property of the `otherIter` iterator with the `delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other.ops.slice(1)).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other.ops` array with the `delta` object, starting from the second element (i.e., the `rest` of the `other.ops` array).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other.ops.slice(0, other.ops.length - 1)).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other.ops` array with the `delta` object, starting from the first
