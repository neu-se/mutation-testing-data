  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' && function () { return 'memos' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code snippet returns the string 'memo' while the new code returns a function that returns the string 'memos'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo' || function () { return 'memos' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code snippet returns the string 'memo' while the new code returns a function that returns the string 'memos'. However, this change would result in a different evaluation of the conditional expression, as the logical OR operator would be applied to the function, which would result in a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos' / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code snippet returns the string 'memo' while the new code returns the result of dividing the string 'memos' by 0, which would result in an error.
