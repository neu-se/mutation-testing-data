  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.resolve` method to resolve the path relative to the current working directory, rather than the directory containing the current module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.resolve` method to resolve the path relative to the parent directory of the current module, rather than the current working directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `path.resolve` method to resolve the path relative to the root directory, rather than the current working directory or the parent directory of the current module.

DONE.
