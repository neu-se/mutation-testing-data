  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than `isPromise` in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a different function that checks if a promise is fulfilled, which may have different behavior than `isPromise` in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a different function that checks if a promise is rejected, which may have different behavior than `isPromise` in certain situations.

DONE.
