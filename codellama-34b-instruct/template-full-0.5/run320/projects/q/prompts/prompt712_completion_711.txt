  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with a single element, instead of the original behavior of returning a promise for an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with three elements, instead of the original behavior of returning a promise for an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with five elements, instead of the original behavior of returning a promise for an empty array.

DONE.
