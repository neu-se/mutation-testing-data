  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a + (1 == b)`, which would always be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a - (1 == b)`, which would always be falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has higher precedence than the `==` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a * (1 == b)`, which would always be truthy.

DONE.
