  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!resolvedPromise` would invert the condition, so the `reject()` method would be called instead of `resolve()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise === true` would treat `resolvedPromise` as a boolean value, which would evaluate to `false` if it was unresolved (i.e., a promise) or `true` if it was resolved to the value `true`. However, the original code fragment uses the `resolvedPromise` variable as a promise, which would be evaluated differently in the replacement code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{resolvedPromise}.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `{resolvedPromise}.promiseDispatch` would evaluate to the `promiseDispatch` method of the `resolvedPromise` object
