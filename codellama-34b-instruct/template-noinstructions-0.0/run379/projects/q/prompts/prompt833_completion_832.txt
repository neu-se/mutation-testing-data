  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the `progress` argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the actual progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the `progress` argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the actual progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("progress is not a function")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with the actual progress value.

DONE.
