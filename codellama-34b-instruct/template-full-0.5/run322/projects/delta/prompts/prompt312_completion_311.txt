  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` would cause the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect index, leading to potential bugs in the `predicate` function's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i - 1` would cause the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect index, leading to potential bugs in the `predicate` function's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 2` would cause the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect index, leading to potential bugs in the `predicate` function's logic.

DONE.
