  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be increased by 1, which could cause the resulting time string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset used for the time string would be different from the original code, which could cause the resulting time string to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be negated, which could cause the resulting time string to be incorrect.

DONE.
