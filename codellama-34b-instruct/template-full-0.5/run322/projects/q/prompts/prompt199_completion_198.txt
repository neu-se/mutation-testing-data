  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of `hasStacks`, which is the variable that determines whether the stack trace should be made long or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of `hasStacks`, which is the variable that determines whether the stack trace should be made long or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the resolved promise, which is the variable that contains the promise that was resolved.

DONE.
