  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is increased by 1 degree, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is increased by 1 degree, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
