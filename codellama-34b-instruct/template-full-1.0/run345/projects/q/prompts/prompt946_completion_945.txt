  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so calling it as a function (as in `nodeArgs.push(<PLACEHOLDER>)`) would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so calling it as a function (as in `nodeArgs.push(<PLACEHOLDER>)`) would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is not the same as the original `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, which returns a function that is bound to the `deferred` object and can be called to resolve or reject the promise.

DONE.
