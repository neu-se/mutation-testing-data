Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the deferred object with a resolved state instead of a pending state, causing any subsequent calls to resolve or reject to have no effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` may lead to unexpected behavior in the promise resolution process, potentially causing the promise to remain unresolved or behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it may lead to the same issue as passing `null`, where the deferred object does not behave as expected, potentially causing the promise to not resolve or reject properly.

DONE.
