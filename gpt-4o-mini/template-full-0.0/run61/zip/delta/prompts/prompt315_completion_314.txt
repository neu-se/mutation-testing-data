Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the `retain` property of the operation instead of its length, potentially leading to incorrect deletions in the inverted delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the length of the `insert` property directly, which may not exist or be undefined for operations that do not have an `insert` property, leading to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete zero characters, effectively making the `invert` function do nothing for any operation that has an `insert`, which would not reflect the intended inversion logic.

DONE.
