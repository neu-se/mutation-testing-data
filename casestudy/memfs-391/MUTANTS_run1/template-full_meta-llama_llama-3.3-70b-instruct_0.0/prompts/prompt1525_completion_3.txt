Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially overwriting existing data or creating a new file if it doesn't exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode instead of read mode, allowing data to be added to the end of the file without overwriting existing content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + 'x', 'r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file name would be modified by appending 'x' to it, potentially resulting in a different file being accessed or an error being thrown if the modified file name does not exist.

DONE.
