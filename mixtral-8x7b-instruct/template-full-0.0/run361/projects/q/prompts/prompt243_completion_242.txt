 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect() === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `inspect()` method returns `undefined`, instead of checking if `resolvedPromise` is not defined. This might always evaluate to `true`, causing the promise to always be resolved, even if it shouldn't be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` are truthy, instead of checking if `resolvedPromise` is not defined. This might cause the promise to behave differently depending on the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages === void 0
