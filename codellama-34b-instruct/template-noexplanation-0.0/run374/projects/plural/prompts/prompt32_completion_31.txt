  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it has a different behavior. The `substr` method is called with a different second argument, which will result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
