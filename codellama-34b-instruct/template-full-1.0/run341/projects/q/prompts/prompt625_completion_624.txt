  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```matlab
resolutions = Q(resolutions);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the `resolutions` variable from a primitive data type (e.g., string) to an object, which could potentially cause issues with the code that uses it.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```matlab
resolutions = Q(resolutions).promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the `resolutions` variable from a primitive data type (e.g., string) to a promise object, which could potentially cause issues with the code that uses it.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```matlab
resolutions = Q(resolutions).rejected;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the `resolutions` variable from a primitive data type (e.g., string) to a rejected promise object, which could potentially cause issues with the code that uses
