Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode a URI, resulting in opposite operations being performed on the `normalizedUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape
```
This would result in different behavior because `unescape` is used to unescape a string, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode a URI, which handles URI-specific decoding, resulting in different handling of special characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.replace(/\\/g, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement would remove backslashes from the `normalizedUrl` and replace them with forward slashes, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode the URI, which would handle backslashes differently, potentially resulting in different path interpretations.

DONE.
