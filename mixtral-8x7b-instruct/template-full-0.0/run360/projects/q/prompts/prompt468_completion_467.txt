 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would not be called for unhandled rejections, and the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array would not have the unhandled rejection added to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would throw a `TypeError` since the second argument is expected to be a string or an Error object, but `null` is not a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function would receive the unhandled rejection reason as the first argument instead of the promise that was rejected. This could cause issues if the reason is not a string or Error object.

DONE.
