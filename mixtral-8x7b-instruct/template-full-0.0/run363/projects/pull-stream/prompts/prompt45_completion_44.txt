 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read !== null && typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `read` to be replaced with `null` or `undefined` and still pass the condition, which could cause unexpected results or errors in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `read.source` is an object, and not a function, which could cause errors if `read.source` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && read.hasOwnProperty('source')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `read` has a property called `source`, but not if it is a function. This could cause errors if `read.source` is expected to be a function.

DONE.
