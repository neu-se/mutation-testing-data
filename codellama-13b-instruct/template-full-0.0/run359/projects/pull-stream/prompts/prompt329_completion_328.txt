  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is now being called with the `data` argument, which could potentially cause different behavior depending on the implementation of `op`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is now being called with two arguments, `data` and `1`, which could potentially cause different behavior depending on the implementation of `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is now being called with three arguments, `data`, `1`, and `2`, which could potentially cause different behavior depending on the implementation of `op`.

DONE.
