Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the specific case of `undefined`, which may not account for other falsy values (like `null`), potentially allowing a country to be memoized even if it exists in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(countries).includes(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `id` is not a key in the `countries` object, which is a different method of checking existence compared to directly checking the value of `countries[id]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if the value of `countries[id]` is `null`, which would allow memoization to occur if the country exists but is set to `null`, thus bypassing the intended memoization logic.

DONE.
