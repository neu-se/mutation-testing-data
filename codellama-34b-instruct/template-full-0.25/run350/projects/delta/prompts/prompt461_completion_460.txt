  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the current op in the rest of the ops, whereas the original code only included ops after the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the current op and the next op in the rest of the ops, whereas the original code only included ops after the next index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 3))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the current op, the next op, and the op after that in the rest of the ops, whereas the original code only included ops after the op after that.

DONE.
