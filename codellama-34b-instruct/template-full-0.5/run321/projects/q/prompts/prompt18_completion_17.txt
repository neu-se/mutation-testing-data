  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = a + b + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` would be 4 instead of 3.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = a + b - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` would be 3 instead of 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = a * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` would be 2 instead of 4.

DONE.
