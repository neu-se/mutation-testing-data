  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different return values for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `Math.sin` is equivalent to `Math.cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the range of `Math.tan` is different from the range of `Math.sin`.

DONE.
