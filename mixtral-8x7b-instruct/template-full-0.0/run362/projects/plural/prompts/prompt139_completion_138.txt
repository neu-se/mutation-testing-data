 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `plural` expects a string as the first argument, but it would receive a number instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression match would fail, and the function would return the original word with an added "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `plural` expects a string as the first argument, but it would receive a random number instead.

DONE.
