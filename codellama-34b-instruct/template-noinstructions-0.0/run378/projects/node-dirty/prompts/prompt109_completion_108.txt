  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific message, while the mutated code emits a different error event with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific message, while the mutated code emits a different error event with a different message.
