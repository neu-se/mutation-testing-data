  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an insert. This change would cause the algorithm to behave differently when it encounters an insert operation in the other iterator.

DONE.
