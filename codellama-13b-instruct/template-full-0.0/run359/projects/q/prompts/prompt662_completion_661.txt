  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an additional argument to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the same arguments to the `dispatch` method as the original code, which would cause the test to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
