  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `#` and ends with the end of the string, while the replacement code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `//` and ends with the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `#` and ends with the end of the string, while the replacement code fragment matches any sequence of characters that starts with a `#` and ends with the end of the string, but only at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
