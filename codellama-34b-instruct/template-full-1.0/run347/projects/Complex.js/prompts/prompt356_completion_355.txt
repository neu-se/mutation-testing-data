  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `d`, which is the denominator of the `Complex` number, to compute the `atan()` function, while the suggested replacement uses `b`, which is the numerator of the `Complex` number. These values are related, but not the same, and using `b` instead of `d` could lead to significant changes in the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `d`, which is the denominator of the `Complex` number, to compute the `atan()` function, while the suggested replacement uses `a`, which is the real component of the `Complex` number. These values are related, but not the same, and using `a` instead of `d` could lead to significant changes in the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
