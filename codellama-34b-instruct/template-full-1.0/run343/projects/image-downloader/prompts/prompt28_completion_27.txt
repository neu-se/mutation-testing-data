  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft().startsWith('https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the URL starts with "https://", but the original code checks if the URL starts with "http://" or "https://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().endsWith('https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the URL ends with "https://", but the original code checks if the URL starts with "http://" or "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!url.trim().includes('https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the URL does not contain the string "https://", but the original code checks if the URL starts with "http://" or "https://".

DONE.
