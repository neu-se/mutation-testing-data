  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'message', err
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'message'` is not being listened to in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write', err
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'write'` is not being listened to in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, which would have different properties and methods than `err`.

DONE.
