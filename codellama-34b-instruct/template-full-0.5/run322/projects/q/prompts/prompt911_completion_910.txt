  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would create a new array from the function's arguments, whereas `baseArgs.concat` would concatenate the `baseArgs` array with the function's arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.push(array_slice(arguments))` would push the function's arguments onto the `baseArgs` array, whereas `baseArgs.concat` would concatenate the `baseArgs` array with the function's arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs.concat(arguments)` would concatenate the `baseArgs` array with the function's arguments, whereas `baseArgs.concat` would concatenate the `baseArgs` array with the function's
