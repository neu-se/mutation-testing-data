  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This change will cause the `ended` variable to always be set to the value of `end`, regardless of whether `ended` was already true or false. This could potentially cause the function to return the wrong value or to enter an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This change will cause the `ended` variable to be set to the opposite of the value of `end`. This could potentially cause the function to return the wrong value or to enter an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && !ended
```
This change will cause the `ended` variable to be set to true if `end` is true and `ended` is false, and to false otherwise. This could potentially cause the function to return the wrong value or to enter an infinite loop.

DONE.
