  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method returns the reversed array, whereas the original code fragment returns the array as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method returns the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method returns the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire array.

DONE.
