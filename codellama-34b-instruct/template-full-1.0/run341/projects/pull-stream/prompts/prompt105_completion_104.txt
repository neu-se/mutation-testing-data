  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `drain()` function would not be called if `null` is replaced with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because a string `'0'` is truthy, and the `drain()` function would be called if `null` is replaced with `'0'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because a number `1` is truthy, and the `drain()` function would be called if `null` is replaced with `1`.

DONE.
