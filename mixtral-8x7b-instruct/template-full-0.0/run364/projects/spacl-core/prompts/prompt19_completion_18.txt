 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string[string.length - 1] === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string ends with a slash, regardless of its length. The original code fragment checks if the string is longer than one character and ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/$|[^/]+$/.test(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string is either an empty path or a path with only one segment. The original code fragment checks if the string is longer than one character and ends with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(-1) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the last character of the string, while the original code fragment checks if the string is longer than one character and ends with a slash.

DONE.
