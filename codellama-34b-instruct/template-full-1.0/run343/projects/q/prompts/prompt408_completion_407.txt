  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` returns true for any object with a `then` method, while `isPromise` only returns true for instances of the `Promise` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would return true for any value that is not an instance of the `Promise` class, while `isPromiseAlike` would return true for any object with a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof promise === "object" && promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof promise === "object"` would return true for any object, while `isPromiseAlike` only returns true for objects with a `then` method.

DONE.
