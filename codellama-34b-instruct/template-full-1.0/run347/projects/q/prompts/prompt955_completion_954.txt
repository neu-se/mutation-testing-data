  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` parameter is not being bound to the `bound` function, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound.bind(this)).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is being bound to a different context using `bind`, which could cause it to behave differently and potentially fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(bound, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfapply` function is being used instead of `Q.fapply`, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially fail.

DONE.
