 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called unconditionally, even if the `done` callback has already been called. The original code fragment, `null`, does not affect the execution of `drain(null, done)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` would receive a number instead of `null`. This could cause `drain` to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` would receive the `done` callback as its first argument instead of `null`. This could cause `drain` to behave differently, depending on its implementation, and might also cause issues if `drain` calls the `done` callback more than once.

DONE.
