  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength` is a function, and it is called as a function in the original code fragment. Replacing it with `iter.peekLength` without the parentheses would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType` is a function, and it is called as a function in the original code fragment. Replacing it with `iter.peekType` without the parentheses would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` is a function, and it is called as a function in the original code fragment. Replacing it with `iter.next` without the parentheses would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
