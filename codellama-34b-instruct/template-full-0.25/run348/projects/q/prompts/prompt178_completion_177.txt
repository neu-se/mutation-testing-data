  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number is now 1 instead of the original line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number is now 0 instead of the original line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:100"
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number is now 100 instead of the original line number.

DONE.
