  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$[\w_,.]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the underscore was added to the character class, which is not part of the original regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches a word boundary (\b) character at the beginning and end of each word, which is not the case for the original regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the "s" character is no longer matched, which would prevent words ending in "s" from being matched by the regex.

DONE.
