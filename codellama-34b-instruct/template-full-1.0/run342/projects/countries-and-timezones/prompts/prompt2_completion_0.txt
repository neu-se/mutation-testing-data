  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data[id]` is not the same as `getTimezonesMap(data)[id]`. The `getTimezonesMap` function returns a map of timezones for the given data, while `data[id]` would return the value at a specific index in the `data` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones[id]` is not the same as `getTimezonesMap(data)[id]`. The `getTimezonesMap` function returns a map of timezones for the given data, while `data.timezones[id]` would return the value at a specific index in the `data.timezones` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones)[id]
```
This would result in different behavior
