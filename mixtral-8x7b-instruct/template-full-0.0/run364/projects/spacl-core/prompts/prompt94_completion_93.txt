 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'random_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the policy name with a random string, which would cause the `this.get(<PLACEHOLDER>)` call to always return `undefined`, even if a policy with the given name exists in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => policy.name
