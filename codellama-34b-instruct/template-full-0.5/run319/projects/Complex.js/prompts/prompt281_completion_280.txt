  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(2*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is applied to `2*b`, which is different from the original code where it was applied to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(2*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is applied to `2*b`, which is different from the original code where it was applied to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(2*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is applied to `2*b`, which is different from the original code where it was applied to `b`.

DONE.
