  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable as a parameter for the `fs.writeFile` function, which expects a file path as a string. By adding `.json` to the end of the `file` variable, we are changing the file path to a different file that may not exist, which could cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `file` variable as a parameter for the `fs.writeFile` function, which expects a file path as a string. By replacing the `.json` extension with an empty string, we are changing the file path to a different file that may not exist, which could cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '.txt')
```
This would result in
