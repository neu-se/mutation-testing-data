  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (countries.length === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `countries` is falsey, while the replaced code checks if `countries` has a length of 0. This means that if `countries` is an empty array, the replaced code will enter the if statement and modify the return value, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (countries.includes(""))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `countries` is falsey, while the replaced code checks if `countries` includes an empty string. This means that if `countries` contains an empty string, the replaced code will enter the if statement and modify the return value, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!countries.some(country => country.trim() === ""))
```
This would result in different behavior
