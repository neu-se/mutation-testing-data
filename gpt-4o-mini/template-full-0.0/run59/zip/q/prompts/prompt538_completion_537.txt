Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent property `any` instead of the intended `all`, which would likely lead to an error or undefined behavior when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `all` to `allSettled`, which has a different purpose and returns a promise that resolves when all of the given promises have either resolved or rejected, rather than resolving only when all promises have resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from gathering multiple promises with `all` to resolving a single promise, which would not behave as expected in a scenario where multiple promises are being handled.

DONE.
