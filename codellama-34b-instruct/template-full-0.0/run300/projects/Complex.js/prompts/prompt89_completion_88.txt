  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` rounds the number towards zero, while `parseFloat` rounds to the nearest number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` converts the argument to a number, while `parseFloat` parses a string and returns a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds the number to the nearest integer, while `parseFloat` parses a string and returns a floating-point number.

DONE.
