  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the first string to itself, rather than to the second string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the first string to a non-existent third string, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the first string to the second string, but with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase.

DONE.
