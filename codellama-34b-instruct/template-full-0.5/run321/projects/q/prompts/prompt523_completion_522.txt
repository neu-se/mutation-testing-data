  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the argument `undefined`, which is likely to cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the argument `null`, which is likely to cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the argument `0`, which is likely to cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
