 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is called immediately and its result is pushed into `nodeArgs`, rather than being used as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is pushed into `nodeArgs` instead of a function, causing the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is pushed into `nodeArgs` instead of a function that resolves or rejects the deferred promise.

DONE.
