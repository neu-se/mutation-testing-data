  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not being called on the promise returned by `Q.ninvoke`, which is what the original code expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is being called on the promise returned by `Q.ninvoke`, but the `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` functions are not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(function (result) {
    deferred.resolve(result);
}, function (error) {
    deferred.reject(error);
});
