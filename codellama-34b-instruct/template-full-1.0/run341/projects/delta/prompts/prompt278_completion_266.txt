  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the peek function to skip over the next character, potentially causing the program to miss an important operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the peek function to backtrack and return earlier than expected, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the peek function to return twice the expected length of the next operation, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
