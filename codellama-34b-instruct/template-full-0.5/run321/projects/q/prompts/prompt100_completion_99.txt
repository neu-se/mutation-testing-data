  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` for sparse arrays, regardless of whether the index is actually present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` for indexes that are actually present in the array, and would ignore any sparse elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` for indexes that are actually present in the array, and would ignore any sparse elements. Additionally, it would also ignore any inherited properties on the array object.

DONE.
