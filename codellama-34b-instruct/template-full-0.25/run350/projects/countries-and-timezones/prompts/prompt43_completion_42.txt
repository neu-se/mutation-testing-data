  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone objects for the country instead of the country object itself, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).allTimezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the timezones for the country instead of the country object itself, which is not what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
