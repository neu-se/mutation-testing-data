  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, which would remove the "index" part of the URL, even if it is followed by a file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a backslash, which would escape the following character, causing the regular expression to match a different part of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a wildcard character, which would match any character, including the file extension.

DONE.
