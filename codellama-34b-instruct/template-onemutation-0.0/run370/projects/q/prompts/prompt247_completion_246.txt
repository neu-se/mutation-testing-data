  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `e.stack.substring` would return a substring starting from the first character of the stack trace, while the modified code fragment `e.stack.substring(0)` would return the entire stack trace.

DONE.
