  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes characters from the end of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This could cause the request to be sent to a different URL than intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` returns a substring of the original string starting from the second character, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This could cause the request to be sent to a different URL than intended, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a substring of the original string starting from the second character, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This could cause the request to be sent to a different URL than intended
