  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a copy of the `arguments` object, rather than a copy of the `arguments` object with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a copy of the `arguments` object with the first element removed, rather than a copy of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1, arguments.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a copy of the `arguments` object with the first element removed, rather than a copy of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
