  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is a different function from `cosh` and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is a different function from `cosh` and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth` is a different function from `cosh` and would produce a different result for the same input.

DONE.
