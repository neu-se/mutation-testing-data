  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be double the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * π
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be in radians instead of degrees.

DONE.
