Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to an empty object if `op.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute inversion when `baseOp.attributes` is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `baseOp.attributes` instead of `op.attributes`, which could lead to incorrect attribute mapping during the inversion process, as it ignores the current operation's attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...op.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `op.attributes`, which may not reflect the intended inversion logic if `op.attributes` contains nested objects or references that should be preserved.

DONE.
