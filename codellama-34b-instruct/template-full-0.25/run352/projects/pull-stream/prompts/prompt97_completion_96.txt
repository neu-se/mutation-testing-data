  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so the `if` statement would be entered even if `ended` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the `if` statement would only be entered if `ended` is both `true` and a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks for both `ended` and `true` to be truthy values, so the `if` statement would only be entered if both conditions are met.

DONE.
