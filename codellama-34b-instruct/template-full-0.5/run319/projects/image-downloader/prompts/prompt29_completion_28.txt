  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could potentially cause issues with SSL/TLS encryption and authentication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `ftp` module instead of the `http` or `https` module, which could potentially cause issues with file transfer and authentication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'smtp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would use the `smtp` module instead of the `http` or `https` module, which could potentially cause issues with email sending and authentication.

DONE.
