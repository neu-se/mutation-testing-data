Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the offset is greater than the index and if priority is true, which would incorrectly adjust the index when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'insert' && (offset < index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition to check for 'insert', causing the code to incorrectly handle cases where it should be processing 'insert' operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'delete' && (offset < index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for 'delete' operations instead of 'insert', which would lead to incorrect index adjustments when encountering delete operations.

DONE.
