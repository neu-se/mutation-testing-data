  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return an array of timezone objects, rather than an object with timezone names as keys. This will likely cause the `getAllTimezones` function to fail, as it relies on the object keys to iterate over the timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return an array of key-value pairs, rather than an object with timezone names as keys. This will likely cause the `getAllTimezones` function to fail, as it relies on the object keys to iterate over the timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.map(key => tzs[key])
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return an array of timezone objects, rather than an object with timezone names as keys. This will likely cause
