  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `concat` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different purposes and behaviors. `slice` creates a new `Delta` object that contains a subset of the ops from the original `Delta` object, while `concat` creates a new `Delta` object that contains the ops from both the original `Delta` object and the other `Delta` object.

DONE.
