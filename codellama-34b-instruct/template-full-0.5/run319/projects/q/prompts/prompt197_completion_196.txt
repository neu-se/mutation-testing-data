  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the portion of the stack trace after the "at" keyword, which may not include the necessary information to identify the source of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the portion of the stack trace before the "at" keyword, which may not include the necessary information to identify the source of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("at ")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the portion of the stack trace after the second "at" keyword, which may not include the necessary information to identify the source of the error.

DONE.
