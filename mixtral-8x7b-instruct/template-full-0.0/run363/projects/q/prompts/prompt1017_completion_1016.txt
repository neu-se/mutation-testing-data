 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function is not called, and the promise is immediately rejected with no error information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function is not called, and the promise is immediately resolved with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)("invalid", [name, nodeArgs]).fail;
```
This would result in different behavior because an invalid method name "invalid" is used instead of "post", which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
