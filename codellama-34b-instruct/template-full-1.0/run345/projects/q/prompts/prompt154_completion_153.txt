  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator to use "a" instead of the line feed and line feed characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"b" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "b"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator to use "b" instead of the line feed and line feed characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"c" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "c"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the separator to use "c" instead of the line feed and line feed characters.

DONE.
