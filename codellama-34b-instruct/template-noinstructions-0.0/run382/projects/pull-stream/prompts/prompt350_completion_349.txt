  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `prop` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the object it is called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test.bind(null)` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `prop.test` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the object it is called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test.bind(this)` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `prop.test` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the object it is called on.

DONE.
