  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty Delta object, rather than a Delta object that contains the contents of the base Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a Delta object that contains the contents of the base Delta object, but with the first element removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(-1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a Delta object that contains the contents of the base Delta object, but with the last element removed.

DONE.
