  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `test` is a string, rather than a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `test` is not a string, rather than a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of `test` is not equal to 1, rather than checking if it is a number.

DONE.
