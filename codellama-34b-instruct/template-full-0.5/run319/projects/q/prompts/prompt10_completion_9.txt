  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be defined twice, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to not be defined at all, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to be defined as null, which would cause an error.

DONE.
