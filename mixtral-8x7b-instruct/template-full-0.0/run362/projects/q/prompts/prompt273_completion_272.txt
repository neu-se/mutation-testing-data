 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressListener` function would receive `null` as an argument instead of the expected `progress` value. This could cause issues if the `progressListener` function is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressListener` function would receive an empty object as an argument instead of the expected `progress` value. This could cause issues if the `progressListener` function is not designed to handle unexpected input types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressListener` function would receive the `progress` value plus 1 as an argument instead of the expected `progress` value. This could cause issues if the `progressListener` function is not designed to handle modified input values.

DONE.
