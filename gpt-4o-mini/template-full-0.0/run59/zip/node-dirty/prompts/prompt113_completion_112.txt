Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a size of 1 instead of the actual size of `_data`, which could mislead any listeners expecting the correct size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a size that is always one greater than the actual size of `_data`, potentially causing inconsistencies in the application logic that relies on the correct size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a size that is double the actual size of `_data`, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the number of items in the data structure.

DONE.
