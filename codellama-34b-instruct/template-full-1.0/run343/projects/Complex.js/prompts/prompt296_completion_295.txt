  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` here is the real part of the complex number, and `1` is added to it, effectively changing the value of the angle in the trigonometric functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.PI - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the mathematical constant Ï€, and `a` is subtracted from it, effectively inverting the angle in the trigonometric functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because `2*a` is twice the value of `a`, effectively doubling the angle in the trigonometric functions.

DONE.
