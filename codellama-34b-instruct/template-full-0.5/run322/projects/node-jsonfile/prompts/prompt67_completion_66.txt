  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `\uFEFF` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `\uFEFF` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `\uFEFF` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with undefined.

DONE.
