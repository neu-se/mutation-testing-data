  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, match
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, and the `match` function would receive the `result` instead of the `match` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){return [match, result]})()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return an array of the `match` and `result` values, rather than the actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would be returned, and the first element (the `result` value) would be accessed.

Done.
