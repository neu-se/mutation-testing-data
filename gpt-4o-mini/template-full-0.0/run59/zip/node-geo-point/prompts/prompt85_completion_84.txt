Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of `cosφ1` to use the sine of `φ1` instead of the cosine, which will lead to incorrect results in the destination point calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1 + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the cosine calculation by adding 1 to `φ1`, which will produce an incorrect angle and thus an incorrect destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the cosine of `φ2` instead of `φ1`, which will lead to incorrect calculations in the destination point, as it mixes up the reference points for the trigonometric calculations.

DONE.
