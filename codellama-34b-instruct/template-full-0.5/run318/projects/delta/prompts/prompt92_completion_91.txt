  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `index` is greater than `this.ops.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `index` is less than `this.ops.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `index` is equal to `this.ops.length - 1`, even if `this.ops.length` is greater than `index`.

DONE.
