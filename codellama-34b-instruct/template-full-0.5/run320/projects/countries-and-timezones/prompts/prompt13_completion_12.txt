  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `id` to the `current` and `all` arrays, even if it is not a valid timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [tz.r], all: [tz.r] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `tz.r` to the `current` and `all` arrays, even if it is not a valid timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [tz.r], all: [tz.r] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `tz.r` to the `current` and `all` arrays, even if it is not a valid timezone.

DONE.
