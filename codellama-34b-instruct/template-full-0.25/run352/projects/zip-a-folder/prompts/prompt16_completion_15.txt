  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for read access to the target base path, whereas the original code fragment checks for both read and write access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for write access to the target base path, whereas the original code fragment checks for both read and write access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for read, write, and execute access to the target base path, whereas the original code fragment only checks for read and write access.
