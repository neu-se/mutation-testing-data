  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `diffResult` to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `diffResult` to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which would cause the `diffResult` to be different from the original code.

DONE.
