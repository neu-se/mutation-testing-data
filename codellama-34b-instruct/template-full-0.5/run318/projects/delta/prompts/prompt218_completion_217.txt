  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<other.ops.length - 1>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other` delta's ops with the current delta's ops, but it would not include the last op from `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<other.ops.length - 2>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other` delta's ops with the current delta's ops, but it would not include the last two ops from `other`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<other.ops.length - 3>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other` delta's ops with the current delta's ops, but it would not include the last three ops from `other`.

DONE.
