Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes three characters from the end of the word instead of two, leading to incorrect pluralization for words that should end in 'i'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'ies' instead of 'i', which would incorrectly pluralize words that should have a singular form ending in 'us' to a form that is not standard.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the suffix from 'i' to 'es', which is not the correct pluralization for words that end in 'us', leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
