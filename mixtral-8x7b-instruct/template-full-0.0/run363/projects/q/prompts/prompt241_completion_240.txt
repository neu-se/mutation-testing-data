 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` check would always return false, causing the resolvedPromise to never be updated and the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function, and the comparison would always return true, causing the resolvedPromise to be updated to the `nearerValue` and potentially resolving the promise prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would now be a random check, and the resolvedPromise may or may not be updated depending on the result of the random check, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject unexpectedly.

DONE.
