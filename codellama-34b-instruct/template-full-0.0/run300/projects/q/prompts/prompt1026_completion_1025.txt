  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` variable, while the new code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` variable, while the new code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` variable, while the new code fragment returns an empty object.

DONE.
