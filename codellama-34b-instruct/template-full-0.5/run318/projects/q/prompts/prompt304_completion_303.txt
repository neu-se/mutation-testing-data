  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing the code to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, and the code would not access any of the elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, and the code would only access the last element in the array.

DONE.
