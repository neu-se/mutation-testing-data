 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the sign of the imaginary component of the current object, rather than the absolute value of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b > this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the absolute imaginary part is greater than the real part, rather than comparing it with a negative version of itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1 * b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the absolute imaginary part before checking its sign, which effectively reverses the condition.

DONE.
