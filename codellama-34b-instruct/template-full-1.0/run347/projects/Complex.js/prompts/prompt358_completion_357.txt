  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be incremented by 1, causing the result of the expression to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be decremented by 1, causing the result of the expression to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of `a` would be flipped, causing the result of the expression to be different.

DONE.
