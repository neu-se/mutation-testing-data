  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
people
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a no-op and return the input string without changing it, whereas the original code handled the special case of "person" and returned "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[people]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array containing the string "people", whereas the original code returned a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"people".toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the word "people" in lowercase, whereas the original code returned the word "people" in its original case.

DONE.
