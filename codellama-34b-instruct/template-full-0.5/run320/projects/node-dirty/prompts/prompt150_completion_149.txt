  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a callback function, while the new code fragment calls the callback function immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a callback function, while the new code fragment sets the value to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a callback function, while the new code fragment sets the value to `null`.

DONE.
