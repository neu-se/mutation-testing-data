  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peek` returns the next operation itself. Using `peekType` instead of `peek` could potentially cause the code to interpret the operation type incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` with an argument of 1 returns the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation. Using `peek(1)` instead of `peekType` could potentially cause the code to interpret the operation type incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, while `peek` returns the next operation itself. Using `peekLength` instead of `
