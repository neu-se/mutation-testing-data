 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last operation from the `ops` array, regardless of the conditions in the `chop` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last operation from the `ops` array, even if it doesn't meet the conditions in the `chop` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly modify the `ops` array, potentially causing unexpected side effects in other parts of the code that rely on the `ops` array.

DONE.
