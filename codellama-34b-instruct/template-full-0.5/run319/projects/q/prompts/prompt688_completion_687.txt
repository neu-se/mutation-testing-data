  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `dispatch` method with a different `this` value and a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `dispatch` method with a different `this` value and a different set of arguments.

DONE.
