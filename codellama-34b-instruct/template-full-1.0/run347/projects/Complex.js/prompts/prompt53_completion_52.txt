  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is part of a larger function that is using the cosine method to calculate the square root of a number, but the replacement code fragment is using the division operator to calculate the square root of a number, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is part of a larger function that is using the cosine method to calculate the square root of a number, but the replacement code fragment is using the sine method to calculate the square root of a number, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is part of a larger function that is using the cosine method to calculate the square root of a number, but the replacement code fragment is using the tangent method to calculate the square root of
