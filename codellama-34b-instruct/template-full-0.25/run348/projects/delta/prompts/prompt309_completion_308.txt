  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length()` would return the length of the line, while `line` would return the line itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.slice(0, 1)` would return the first character of the line, while `line` would return the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.split(' ')[0]` would return the first word of the line, while `line` would return the entire line.

DONE.
