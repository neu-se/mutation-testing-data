  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method now uses the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method now adds 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number before checking if it is infinite, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method now checks if the complex number is NaN instead of infinity, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
