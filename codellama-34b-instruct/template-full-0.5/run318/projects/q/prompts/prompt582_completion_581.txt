  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of `throw`, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of propagating the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "resolve")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called instead of `throw`, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of propagating the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "fulfill")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method would be called instead of `throw`, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of propagating the error.

DONE.
