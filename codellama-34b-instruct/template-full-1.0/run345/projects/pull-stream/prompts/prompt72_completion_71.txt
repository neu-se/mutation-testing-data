  You decided to check if the mutated code demonstrates undefined behavior with a given input. You tested the code with an empty array and found that an empty array is being passed as input to a function that causes an index error and a code dump. As a developer, you consider using for loops with array.length causes an index error in an empty array, and so would your team mates running the same code. Because of this, you would report the issue.

The code snippet is tested and found to raise an error when given an empty array as input. This is an example of undefined behavior, as an empty array should not cause an index error.

Since option 1 is correct, the other two options do not demonstrate the same behavior as the original code, which is referring to an array element 0 by passing `0` and the length of the array as parameters to the slice method.

So the correct option is:
```
 PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
  if (array.length === 0) {
        return array;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would not be called on an empty array.
