  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `nearerValue`, whereas the original code used the `nearer` function to find the nearest promise to the resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `nearerValue`, whereas the original code used the `nearer` function to find the nearest promise to the resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `nearerValue` by 2, whereas the original code used the `nearer` function to find the nearest promise to the resolved promise.

DONE.
