  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key, value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would now receive three arguments instead of two, which would cause it to return `false` even if the object has the specified property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key, value, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would now receive four arguments instead of three, which would cause it to return `false` even if the object has the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key, value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would now receive four arguments instead of three, which would cause it to return `false` even if the object has the specified property.

DONE.
