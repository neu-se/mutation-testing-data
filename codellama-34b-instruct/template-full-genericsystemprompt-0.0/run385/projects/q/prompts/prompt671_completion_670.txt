  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would not pass the array of arguments as a single argument to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the array of arguments as a single argument to the function, instead of passing each argument separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat([])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array that contains the original arguments, instead of passing the original array.

DONE.
