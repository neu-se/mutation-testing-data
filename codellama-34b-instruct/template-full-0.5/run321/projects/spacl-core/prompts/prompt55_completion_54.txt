  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$2')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression replacement uses the wrong backreference. The original code uses `\\$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the mutated code uses `\\$2`, which would refer to the second capture group if it existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$0')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression replacement uses the wrong backreference. The original code uses `\\$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the mutated code uses `\\$0`, which would refer to the entire match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$10')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression replacement uses the wrong
