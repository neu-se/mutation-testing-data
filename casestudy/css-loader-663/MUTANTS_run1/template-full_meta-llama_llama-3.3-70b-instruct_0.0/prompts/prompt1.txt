Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
module.exports = function escape(url) {
    if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
        return url
    }
    // If url is already wrapped in quotes, remove them
    if (/^['"].*['"]$/.test(url)) {
        url = url.slice(1, -1);
    }
    // Should url be wrapped?
    // See https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-3/#urls
    if (/["'() \t\n]/.test(url)) {
        return '"' + url.replace(/"/g, '\\"').replace(/\n/g, '\\n') + '"'
    }

    return url
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
typeof url !== 'string'
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
