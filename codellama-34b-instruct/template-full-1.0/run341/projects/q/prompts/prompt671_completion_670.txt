  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" expects the target function's context as the first argument, while "apply" expects it as the second argument. By passing the arguments array as the first argument to "call", we are effectively shifting the method's context to the first element of the arguments array. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the method is not intended to be used with a modified context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" expects the target function's context as the second argument, while null is not a valid context. By passing null as the second argument, we are effectively calling the method without any context, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the method relies on a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different
