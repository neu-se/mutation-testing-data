  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves to an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` is a method that returns a promise that resolves to the value of the previous promise, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves to an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.resolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves to an array of values.

DONE.
