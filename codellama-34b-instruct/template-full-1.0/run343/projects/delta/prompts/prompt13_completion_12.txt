  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys.length` is always 0, regardless of the number of keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values.length` would return the length of the values in the object, not the number of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries.length` would return the length of the entries in the object, which is a different measurement than the number of keys.

DONE.
