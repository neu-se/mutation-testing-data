  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 1 instead of 2, returning a different array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would not be called with any arguments, causing it to return the entire `arguments` array instead of just a portion of it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 2 and return only 1 element, returning a different array of arguments.

DONE.
