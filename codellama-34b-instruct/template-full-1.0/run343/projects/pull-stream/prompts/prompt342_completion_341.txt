  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks whether `abort` is falsy. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks whether `abort` is strictly equal to `true`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && onAbort(abort === null ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `onAbort` function if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement calls the `onAbort` function if `abort` is `null` or `undefined`. This could potentially cause the function to
