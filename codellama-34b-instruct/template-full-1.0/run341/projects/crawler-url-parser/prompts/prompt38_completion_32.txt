  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `sensitive` in `URL.parse()` would be false, which would cause the URL to be parsed case-sensitively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument `parseQuery` in `URL.parse()` would be false, which would prevent the URL from being parsed into its query string components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
	currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because both `parseQuery` and `sensitive` would be false, which would cause the URL to be parsed in a case-sensitive manner without parsing the query string.

DONE.
