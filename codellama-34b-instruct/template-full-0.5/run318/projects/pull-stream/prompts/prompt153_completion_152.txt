  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
