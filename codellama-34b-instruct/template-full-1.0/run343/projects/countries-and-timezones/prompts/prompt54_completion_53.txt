  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would change the order of the timezones array, which might affect the rest of the code that relies on the specific order of the timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5 ? timezones : "Invalid timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would randomly return either the `timezones` array or the string "Invalid timezone", which would likely cause unexpected errors or inconsistent results in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would create a new array by concatenating the `timezones` array with an empty array, which would likely cause unexpected errors or inconsistent results in the rest of the code.

DONE.
