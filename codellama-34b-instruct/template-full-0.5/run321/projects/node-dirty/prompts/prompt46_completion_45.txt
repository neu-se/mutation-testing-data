  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is being called on the `_data` property instead of the `this` object, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key + 'foo'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is being called with a different key than the original code, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is being concatenated to the value returned by the `get` method, which could cause the method to return a different value.

DONE.
