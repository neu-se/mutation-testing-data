Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the value of `result`, instead of resolving it, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of `result`, but it would not handle the case where `result` is not a promise, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve an array of promises instead of a single promise, which could lead to errors if `result` is not an array or if it contains non-promise values.

DONE.
