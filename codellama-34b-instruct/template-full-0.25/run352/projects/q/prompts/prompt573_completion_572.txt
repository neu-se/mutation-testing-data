  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `null` as the `this` value, which may not be what the author intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, which may not be what the author intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with an empty array as the `this` value, which may not be what the author intended.

DONE.
