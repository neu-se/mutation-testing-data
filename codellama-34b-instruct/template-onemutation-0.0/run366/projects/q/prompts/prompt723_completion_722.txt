  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a function that checks if a value is a promise, and `!isPromise` would check if a value is not a promise. This would cause the code to behave differently when a promise is passed as an argument, as it would be treated as a non-promise value.

DONE.
