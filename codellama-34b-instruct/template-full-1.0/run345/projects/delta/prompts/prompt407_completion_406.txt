  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherHandler` is a different object than `handler`, and may have different methods and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.otherMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.otherMethod()` is a different method than `handler.transform()`, and may have different behavior or produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler['transform']
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler['transform']` is a different function than `handler.transform()`, and may have different behavior or produce different results.

DONE.
