  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` is a function that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType` is a property that returns the type of the current operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

DONE.
