 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new function scope, which might not have access to the `reason` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a function expression, which might not have access to the `reason` variable in some contexts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(undefined, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `reason` as the second argument to `then`, which changes the rejection handling behavior.

DONE.
