  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `shouldThrow` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is originally `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so even if `shouldThrow` is originally `true`, the entire expression will evaluate to `false` because `false && true` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so even if `shouldThrow` is originally `false`, the entire expression will evaluate to `true` because `false || true` is `true`.

DONE.
