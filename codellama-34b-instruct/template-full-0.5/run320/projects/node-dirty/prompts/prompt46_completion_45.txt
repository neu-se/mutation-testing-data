  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the value to be incremented by 1, whereas the original code fragment would pass the original value to the `updater` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the value to be doubled, whereas the original code fragment would pass the original value to the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the value to be decremented by 1, whereas the original code fragment would pass the original value to the `updater` function.

DONE.
