  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index + 1, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the index property would be incremented by 1, leading to inconsistency in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index - 1, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the index property would be decremented by 1, leading to inconsistency in the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: "foo", value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the index property would be replaced with a string "foo", leading to inconsistency in the output.

DONE.
