  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the current index is less than the end index, but this replacement would check if the current index is less than the end index minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the current index is less than the end index, but this replacement would check if the current index is less than the end index plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the current index is less than the end index, but this replacement would check if the current index plus 1 is less than the end index.

DONE.
