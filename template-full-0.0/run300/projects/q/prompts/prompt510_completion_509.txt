  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` by itself would pass the array as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating `args` with an empty array, whereas `args` by itself would pass the array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of `args`, whereas `args` by itself would pass the array as is.

DONE.
