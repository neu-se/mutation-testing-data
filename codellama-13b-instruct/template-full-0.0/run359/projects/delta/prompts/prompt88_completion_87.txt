  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'string' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'string' &&
          newOp.insert.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks if the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is a non-empty string, which is not the case in the original code fragment. This would cause the `push` method to return early, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'string' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'string' &&
          newOp.insert.length === 0
```
