  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first argument, `read`, in the loop, whereas the original code skips over it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last argument in the loop, whereas the original code includes it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last argument and the first argument, `read`, in the loop, whereas the original code includes them.

DONE.
