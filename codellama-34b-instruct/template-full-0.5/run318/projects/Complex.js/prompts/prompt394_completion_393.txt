  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by zero would always result in zero, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of one would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of one would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
