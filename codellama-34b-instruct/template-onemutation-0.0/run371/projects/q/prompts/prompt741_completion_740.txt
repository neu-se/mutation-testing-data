  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a typo, and the correct code should have been:
```
deferred.reject(err);
```
This would cause the promise to be rejected with the original error, rather than the rejection object, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
