  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, whereas the `+` operator would simply return a string, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + Array.prototype.slice.call(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array, whereas the `+` operator would simply return a string, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat.call(baseArgs, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, whereas the `+` operator would simply return a string, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
