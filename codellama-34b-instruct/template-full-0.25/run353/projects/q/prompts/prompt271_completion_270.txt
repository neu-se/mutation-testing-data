  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to `true`, which is not the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to `false`, which is not the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `resolvedPromise` variable is equal to `undefined`, which is not the original behavior.

DONE.
