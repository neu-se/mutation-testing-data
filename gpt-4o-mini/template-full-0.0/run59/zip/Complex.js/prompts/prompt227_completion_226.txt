Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the value of `a`, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the square root when `a` is positive, potentially resulting in a complex number instead of a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a`, which would yield an incorrect result for the square root calculation, as it would not properly account for the real component of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of `a`, which would change the outcome of the square root calculation, especially when `a` is negative, leading to a different result than intended.

DONE.
