Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the test function to always return false, causing the `cb` to never be called with a valid data item, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the test function to always return true, which would cause the `cb` to be called with the first data item received, potentially ignoring subsequent data items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => data === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the test function to only pass the callback if the data is strictly equal to `null`, which would likely lead to the callback being called less frequently or not at all for other data types.

DONE.
