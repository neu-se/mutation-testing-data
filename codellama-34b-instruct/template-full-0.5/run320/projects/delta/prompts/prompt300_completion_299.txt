  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the attributes of the next two operations, instead of just the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object if the next operation has no attributes, instead of the attributes of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes ? {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null if the next operation has no attributes, instead of the attributes of the next operation.

DONE.
