 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always deletes 0 characters, instead of the intended number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta['delete']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the 'delete' property as a string, instead of invoking the 'delete' method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'delete' method on the current object, instead of the 'retDelta' object.

DONE.
