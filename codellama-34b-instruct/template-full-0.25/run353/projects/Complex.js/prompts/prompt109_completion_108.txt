  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and the negation of that check would return `true` for any non-NaN value, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, and it would return `true` for any finite number, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and it would return `true` for any NaN value, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
