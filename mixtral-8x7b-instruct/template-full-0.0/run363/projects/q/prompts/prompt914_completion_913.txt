 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the current function's `arguments` object, whereas the original code refers to the `arguments` object of the outer function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the last argument to the `fapply` method, whereas the original code forwards the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass an array with the values `1`, `2`, and `3` as the last argument to the `fapply` method, whereas the original code forwards the actual arguments.

DONE.
