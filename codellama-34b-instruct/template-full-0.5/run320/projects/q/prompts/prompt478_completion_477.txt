  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the first element from the array, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the last element from the array, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the last element from the array, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or not.

DONE.
