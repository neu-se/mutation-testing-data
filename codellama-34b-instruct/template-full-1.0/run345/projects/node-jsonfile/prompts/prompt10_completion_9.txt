  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function expects a string as its first argument, but `data` is an object. This would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` instead of the expected `SyntaxError` when invalid JSON is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(String(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String` function is used to convert `data` to a string, which would cause the function to behave as expected, but the test would still fail because the `JSON.parse` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, JSON.stringify(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function is used to convert `data` to a JSON string, which would cause the function to behave as expected, but the test would still fail because the
