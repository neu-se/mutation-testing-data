  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the minimum length of the two iterators, whereas the original code calculates the minimum length of the current iteration of the two iterators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the maximum length of the two iterators, whereas the original code calculates the minimum length of the current iteration of the two iterators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the lengths of the two iterators, whereas the original code calculates the minimum length of the current iteration of the two iterators.

DONE.
