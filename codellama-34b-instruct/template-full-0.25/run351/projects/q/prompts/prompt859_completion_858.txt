  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the rejection reason, instead of rejecting the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise with the rejection reason, instead of resolving the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw reason` would throw an exception with the rejection reason, instead of rejecting the promise with the rejection reason.

DONE.
