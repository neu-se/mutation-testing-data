  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is not defined for complex numbers, so the expression `cosh(b)` would evaluate to `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is not defined for complex numbers, so the expression `sinh(b)` would evaluate to `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `cosh(0)` would evaluate to `1`, while the expression `sinh(0)` would evaluate to `0`. This would change the result of the `cos` and `sin` functions, which are used in the `tan` and `cot` functions.

DONE.
