  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method returns `true` if the string starts with the specified substring, while the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the string ends with the specified substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method returns `true` if the string includes the specified substring, while the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the string ends with the specified substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring in the string, while the `endsWith` method returns `true` if the string ends with the specified substring.

DONE.
