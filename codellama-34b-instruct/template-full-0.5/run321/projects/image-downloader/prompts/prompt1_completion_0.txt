  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url || options.url.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `options.url` is an empty string, which would make the `if` statement evaluate to `true` even if the `options.url` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url && options.url.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` is not `undefined` and also has a length greater than 0, which would make the `if` statement evaluate to `true` only if the `options.url` is not `undefined` and has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url || options.url.length === 0 || options.url.length > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url`
