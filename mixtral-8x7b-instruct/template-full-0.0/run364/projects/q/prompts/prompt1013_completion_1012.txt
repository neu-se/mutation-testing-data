 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is not being passed as a callback to `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])`. Instead, it is being invoked immediately, which can cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(null)
