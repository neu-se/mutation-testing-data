  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` returns a new array, while `ref` returns the original array, which may be a bug if the function is expecting to modify the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of the array, while `ref` returns the original array, which may be a bug if the function is expecting to modify the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.concat([])` returns a new array that is a copy of the original array, while `ref` returns the original array, which may be a bug if the function is expecting to modify the original array.

DONE.
