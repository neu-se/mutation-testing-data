  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: index }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would always be equal to the `index` property, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: promises[index] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would always be equal to the element at the `index` position in the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: promises[index].value }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property would always be equal to the `value` property of the element at the `index` position in the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
