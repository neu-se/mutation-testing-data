  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `data` instead of `end` if `end` is falsy, even if `data` is not the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `end` instead of `data` if `end` is truthy, even if `data` is the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `end` instead of `data` if `data` is falsy, even if `end` is the expected value.

DONE.
