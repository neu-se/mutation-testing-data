 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object, while the original code fragment uses the exception object that was caught in the try-catch block. This change would affect any error handling in the `_rejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `self` object (the current promise) instead of the `exception` object. This change would cause the `_rejected` function to handle the promise object instead of the actual exception, which could lead to unexpected behavior in error handling and logging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `exception` object with a null value. This change would cause the `_rejected` function to not have access to the exception object, which would break any error handling and logging mechanisms that rely on the exception object.

DONE.
