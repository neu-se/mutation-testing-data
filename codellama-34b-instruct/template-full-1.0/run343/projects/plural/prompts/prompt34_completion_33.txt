  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the function returning the last character of the word, instead of the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the function returning the length of the word, instead of the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the function returning the last character of the word, instead of the first character.

DONE.
