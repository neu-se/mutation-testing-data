  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let policy
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, whereas `const` is a constant declaration. In this case, `let` would allow the variable `policy` to be reassigned within the loop, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `policy` variable to `null`, which would cause the loop to exit early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `policy` variable to `undefined`, which would cause the loop to exit early.

DONE.
