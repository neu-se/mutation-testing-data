  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `emit` method always emit `null` as the error event, regardless of whether an error actually occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `emit` method always emit `null` as the error event, regardless of whether an error actually occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `emit` method always emit the `error` event with an additional `1` at the end, regardless of whether an error actually occurred.

DONE.
