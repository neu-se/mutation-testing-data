  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the truthiness of the `data` variable. If `data` is truthy, `!data` would be falsy, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is a concatenation operator, which would concatenate the `end` and `data` variables. If `end` is a string, this would result in a new string that is the concatenation of `end` and `data`. If `end` is not a string, this would result in a new string that is the concatenation of `end` and `data`, with a space between them. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`,
