  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

/([.$])/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment '' will match any character (including '/' and '.') and replace it with an empty string. This will cause the compiled regex to match more than the original regex, which was intended to only match a literal '.' or '$'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '<>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment '<>' will match any character (including '/' and '.') and replace it with the string '<>'. This will cause the compiled regex to match more than the original regex, which was intended to only match a literal '.' or '$'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '.*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment '.*' will match any sequence of characters (including '/' and '.') and replace it with the string '.*'. This will cause the
