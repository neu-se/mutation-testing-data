  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(1), deferred.reject(0), deferred.notify(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolve, reject, and notify functions are being called with different arguments, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently than it would have been with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.promise), deferred.reject(deferred.promise), deferred.notify(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolve, reject, and notify functions are being called with the promise itself as an argument, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently than it would have been with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.promise.then(deferred.promise)), deferred.reject(deferred.promise.then(deferred.promise)),
