  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the distance to the nearest integer, which could cause the calculated destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the distance, which would cause the calculated destination point to be twice as far away from the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1000 from the distance, which would cause the calculated destination point to be 1000 meters closer to the starting point.

DONE.
