  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the `policies` array, but the `for` loop would iterate over the `this` object, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of this) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the `this` object, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would create a shallow copy of the `policies` array, which would not be affected by the `for` loop.

DONE.
