  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `a` instead of `b` when `a` is less than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `a` instead of `b` when `a` is equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the sum of `a` and `b` instead of `b` when `a` is less than `b`.

DONE.
