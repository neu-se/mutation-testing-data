  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `del` method, which is an alias for `delete`, but this code uses the `delete` method directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `set` method, which sets a property on an object, but this code uses the `dispatch` method with the `set` operation, which has a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `get` method, which gets a property from an object, but this code uses the `dispatch` method with the `get` operation, which has a different behavior.

DONE.
