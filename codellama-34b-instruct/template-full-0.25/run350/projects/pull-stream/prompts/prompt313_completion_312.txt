  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as the first argument when the stream is ended, but with `undefined` it would be called with a falsy value, which could cause the stream to be considered ended prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, while `null` is a falsy value. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as the first argument when the stream is ended, but with `true` it would be called with a truthy value, which could cause the stream to be considered ended prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value
