  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would not have a `replacer` function, which would cause it to use the default `JSON.stringify` behavior instead of the custom `replacer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would have an empty `replacer` function, which would cause it to use the default `JSON.stringify` behavior instead of the custom `replacer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = () => { throw new Error('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would have a `replacer` function that throws an error, which would cause the `stringify` function to fail and the test suite to fail.

DONE.
