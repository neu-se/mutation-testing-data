 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(function () { resolve(result); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay in resolving the promise, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to be resolved synchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise instead of resolving it, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to be resolved with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.log(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the result instead of resolving the promise, which could cause issues if the promise is expected to be resolved with a value and the value is not logged.

DONE.
