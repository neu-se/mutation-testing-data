  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `>=`, which means that the condition will be true if `length` is greater than `opLength - offset`, instead of being greater than or equal to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `>=`, which means that the condition will be true if `length` is less than or equal to `opLength - offset`, instead of being greater than or equal to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length == opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator is used instead of `>=`, which means that the condition will be true if `length` is equal to `opLength - offset`, instead of being greater than or equal to it.

DONE.
