  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `aborted` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates to `true` if both operands are `true`, and `aborted` is a boolean variable. Therefore, this code fragment would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates to `true` if either operand is `true`, and `aborted` is a boolean variable. Therefore, this code fragment would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `aborted`.

DONE.
