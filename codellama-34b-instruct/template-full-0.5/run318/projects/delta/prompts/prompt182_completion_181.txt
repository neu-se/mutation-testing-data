  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the retained text would be doubled, which could lead to incorrect results in the composition of the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the retained text would be reduced by 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the composition of the two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the retained text would be increased by 1, which could lead to incorrect results in the composition of the two deltas.

DONE.
