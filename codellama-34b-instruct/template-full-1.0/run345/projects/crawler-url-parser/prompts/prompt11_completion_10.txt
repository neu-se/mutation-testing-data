  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[\/]{2}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` character is escaped with a backslash (`\`), which changes its meaning as a regular expression metacharacter. In the original code, `/^\/\//` is a regular expression that matches a string that starts with two slashes (`//`). In the mutated code, `/^[\/]{2}/` is a regular expression that matches a string that starts with two forward slashes (`/`), but the forward slashes are escaped with backslashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(\/\/)|(\/+$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include an alternation (`|`) operator, which means that the expression would match either two consecutive forward slashes (`//`) or one or more forward slashes followed by one or more spaces (`/+`). In the original code, the expression only matches two consecutive forward slashes (`//`).
