 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' property of `z` with Infinity, instead of checking if `z` itself is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `z` object has an `isInfinite` method, instead of checking if the `z` object is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to calculate the reciprocal of the result of the `isInfinite()` method, which would always return a boolean value. This could lead to unexpected results or errors when dividing by zero.

DONE.
