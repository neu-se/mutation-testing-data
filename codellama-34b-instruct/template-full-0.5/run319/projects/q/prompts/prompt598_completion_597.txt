  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and adding 1 to it would produce a different string, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and concatenating "1" to it would produce a different string, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.concat("1")
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and using the `concat` method to concatenate "1" to it would produce a different string, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
