  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, whereas `Math.cos` is the cosine function, which returns the cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is the inverse cosine function, which returns the angle whose cosine is the specified number, whereas `Math.cos` is the cosine function, which returns the cosine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` is the cubic root function, which returns the cube root of a number, whereas `Math.cos` is the cosine function, which returns the cosine of a number.

DONE.
