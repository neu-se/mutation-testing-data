  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but replacing it with `null` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expected to be a function, but replacing it with an empty arrow function would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

DONE.
