 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(value, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` accepts only one argument, and passing an additional argument would cause an error in some implementations of the Q library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Q.resolve` method instead of the `deferred.resolve` method, which may have different behavior in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(function () { deferred.resolve(value); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `deferred.resolve` call in a `setTimeout` function with a delay of 0 milliseconds, which could cause the resolution of the promise to be scheduled in a different tick of the event loop, potentially leading to different behavior in certain situations.

DONE.
