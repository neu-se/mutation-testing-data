  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with `null` as an argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a resolved promise with a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with `undefined` as an argument, which would cause it to return a resolved promise with a new deferred object that has a `null` value instead of a resolved promise with a new deferred object that has a `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with an `Error` object as an argument, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with the `Error` object instead of a resolved promise with a new deferred object.
