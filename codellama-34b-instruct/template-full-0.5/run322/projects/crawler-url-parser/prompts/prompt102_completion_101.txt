  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the current URL from the map, which could lead to incorrect results when extracting URLs from the data.

DONE.
