  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `aborted`, and the function would not behave as expected if `undefined` is passed to the `abort` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `aborted`, and the function would not behave as expected if `null` is passed to the `abort` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not the same as `aborted`, and the function would not behave as expected if `true` is passed to the `abort` parameter.

DONE.
