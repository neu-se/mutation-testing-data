  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is falsy, while the new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is truthy or `op.attributes` is truthy.
