  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy and has a `message` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy or has a `message` property.

DONE.
