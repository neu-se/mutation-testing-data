Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator instead of the logical AND operator, meaning that the condition will evaluate to true if `read` is falsy, which is not the intended logic of checking if `read` is defined and if `read.source` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `read.source` is an object instead of a function, which would incorrectly allow the code to proceed even if `read.source` is not callable, potentially leading to runtime errors later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && read.source === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `read.source` is strictly equal to `undefined`, which would bypass the check for whether `read.source` is a function, allowing the code to execute without the necessary function check.

DONE.
