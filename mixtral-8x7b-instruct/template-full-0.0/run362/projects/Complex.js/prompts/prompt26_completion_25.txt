 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Invalid Param'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the thrown error message from a SyntaxError to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the thrown error to a number, which is not a SyntaxError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Invalid Param')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the thrown error to an Error object, which is not a SyntaxError.

DONE.
