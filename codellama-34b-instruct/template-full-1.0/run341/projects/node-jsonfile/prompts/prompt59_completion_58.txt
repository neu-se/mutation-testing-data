  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\r+, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because `\r+` would match one or more carriage returns, whereas `\n` matches a single newline character. If the input string contains carriage returns but no newline characters, the original code would replace them with the specified `EOL` character, while the modified code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\n+, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because `\n+` would match one or more newline characters, whereas `\n` matches a single newline character. If the input string contains multiple newline characters, the original code would replace them all with the specified `EOL` character, while the modified code would replace only the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[^\n\r]+, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because `[^\n\r]+` would match one or more characters that are not newline or carriage returns, whereas `\n` matches
