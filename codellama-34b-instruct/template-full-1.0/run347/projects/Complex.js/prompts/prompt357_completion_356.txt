  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a divide-by-zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the sinh calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the cosh calculation.

DONE.
