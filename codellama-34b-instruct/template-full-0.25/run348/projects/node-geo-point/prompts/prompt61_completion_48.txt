  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `φ2` instead of `φ1` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the second point's latitude, which could result in a different bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the first point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `λ1` instead of `φ1` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the first point's longitude, which could result in a different bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `φ1` is a variable representing the
