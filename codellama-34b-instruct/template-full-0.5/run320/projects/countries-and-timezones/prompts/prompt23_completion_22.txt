  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add one minute to the UTC offset, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the UTC offset, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract one minute from the UTC offset, which would change the resulting offset string.

DONE.
