  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor function that returns a promise, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor function that returns a promise, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called on the string "Q", which is not a promise, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
