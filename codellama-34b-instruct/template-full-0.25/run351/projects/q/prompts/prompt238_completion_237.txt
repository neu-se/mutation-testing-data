  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(resolvedPromise))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not a function and would result in a runtime error.
