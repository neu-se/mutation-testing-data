  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with a new error object, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an error to be thrown, whereas `fulfill` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
