  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because 1 is a number and not an error object, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is an object and not an error object, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ message: "Error" }
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different error object than the original and would cause the promise to reject with a different error message.

DONE.
