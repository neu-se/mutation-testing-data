  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Infinity` instead of `NaN` when dividing by zero, which is a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `NaN` instead of `Infinity` when dividing by zero, which is a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `NaN` instead of `Infinity` when dividing by zero, which is a different result.

DONE.
