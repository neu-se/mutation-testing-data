  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database contains an empty line')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, but the error type and the fact that an error occurred would still be the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`The database contains an empty line (key: ${key}, value: ${val})`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would include more information about the key and value associated with the empty line, which could be useful for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`The database contains an empty line (queue size: ${this._queue.size})`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would include information about the size of the write queue, which could be useful for debugging.

DONE.
