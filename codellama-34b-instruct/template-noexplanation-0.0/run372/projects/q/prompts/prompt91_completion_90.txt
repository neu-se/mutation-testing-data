  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this)
```
This code fragment uses the `call` method to call the `slice` method on the `Array.prototype` object, which is the same as calling `Array.prototype.slice()` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.apply(this)
```
This code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `slice` method on the `Array.prototype` object, which is the same as calling `Array.prototype.slice()` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.bind(this)()
```
This code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that calls the `slice` method on the `Array.prototype` object, and then calls that function immediately. This is equivalent to calling `Array.prototype.slice()` directly.

DONE.
