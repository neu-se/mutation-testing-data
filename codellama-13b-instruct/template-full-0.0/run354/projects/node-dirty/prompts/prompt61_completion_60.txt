  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is called on the read stream, which would cause the stream to be destroyed and any pending data to be discarded. This could potentially cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close()` method is called on the read stream, which would cause the stream to be closed and any pending data to be flushed to the underlying resource. This could potentially cause the program to behave differently, as the stream may not be able to be reopened.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method is called on the read stream, which would cause the stream to be ended and any pending data to be flushed to the underlying resource. This could potentially cause the program to behave differently
