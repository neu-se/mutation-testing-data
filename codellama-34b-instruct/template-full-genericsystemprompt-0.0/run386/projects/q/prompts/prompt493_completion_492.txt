  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `rejected` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of the `rejected` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the promise was not rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `false` if the `rejected` variable is truthy, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the promise was rejected.

DONE.
