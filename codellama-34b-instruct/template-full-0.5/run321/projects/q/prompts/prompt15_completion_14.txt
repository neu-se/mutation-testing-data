  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `global.Q` to a variable, but it would not change the value of `global.Q` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.Q = previousQ;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `global.Q` to the value of `previousQ`, which is the value of `global.Q` before the assignment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.Q = definition();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `global.Q` to the result of calling the `definition` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
