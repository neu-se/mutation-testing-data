  Option 1:
```
null.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a constant value that is not a method or function, so the invocation would fail and produce a runtime error.

Option 2:
```
this.dispatch2
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch2` is not a defined property or method on the `this` object, so the invocation would fail and produce a runtime error.

Option 3:
```
this.dispatch(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is being called with a `null` argument, which would cause a different set of actions to be performed by the method than if it were called with the original `nodeArgs` argument.
