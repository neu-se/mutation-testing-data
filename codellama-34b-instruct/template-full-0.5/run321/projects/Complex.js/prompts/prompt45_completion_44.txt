  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` would check if `a` is null or undefined, while `typeof a` would only check if `a` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== a` would check if `a` is NaN, while `typeof a` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor.name` would return the name of the constructor function used to create `a`, while `typeof a` would return the type of `a` as a string.

DONE.
