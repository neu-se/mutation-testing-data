  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + "abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would start with "abc", which is not present in the original stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would start with the second character of the first line of the stack trace, rather than the actual first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(":", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would no longer contain the line number and column number for each frame, as these are denoted by colons.

DONE.
