  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the promise is rejected, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the promise is still pending, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would pass even if the promise is fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
