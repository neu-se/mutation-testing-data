  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is not an array and does not have a `slice` method, so `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that only works on arrays, and `arguments` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is a method that only works on arrays, and `arguments` is not an array.

DONE.
