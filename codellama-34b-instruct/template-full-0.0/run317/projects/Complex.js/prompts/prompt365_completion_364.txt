  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `sinh` is an odd function, meaning that `sinh(-x) = -sinh(x)`, while `cosh` is an even function, meaning that `cosh(-x) = cosh(x)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `tanh` is a hyperbolic function, meaning that it has a range of values that is not limited to the range of real numbers, while `cosh` is a trigonometric function, meaning that it has a range of values that is limited to the range of real numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh
