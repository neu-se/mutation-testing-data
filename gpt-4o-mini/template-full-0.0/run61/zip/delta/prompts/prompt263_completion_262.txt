Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of `thisOp` instead of `otherOp`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute comparisons when determining the differences between the two `Delta` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the second argument to `AttributeMap.diff`, which would ignore the attributes of `otherOp` entirely, likely resulting in incorrect diff calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` instead of the actual attributes of `otherOp`, which could lead to unexpected results in the diffing process, as the function may not handle `undefined` as a valid input for attribute comparison.

DONE.
