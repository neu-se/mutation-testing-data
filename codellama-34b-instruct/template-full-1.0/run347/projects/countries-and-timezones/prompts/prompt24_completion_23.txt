  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function expects a non-zero value as input, and returning 0 would cause the function to return a wrong string representation of the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function expects a positive value as input, and subtracting 1 from `utcOffset` would cause the function to return a wrong string representation of the offset for negative offsets.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function expects a positive value as input, and adding 1 to `utcOffset` would cause the function to return a wrong string representation of the offset for positive offsets.

DONE.
