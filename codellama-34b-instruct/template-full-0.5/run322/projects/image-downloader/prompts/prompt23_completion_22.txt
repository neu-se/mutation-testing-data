  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` refers to the current file's path, while `__dirname` refers to the current file's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, while `__dirname` refers to the directory of the current file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(__filename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(__filename)` returns the directory of the current file, while `__dirname` refers to the current file's directory.

DONE.
