  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the value of `a[key]` would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the value of `a[key]` would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the value of `a[key]` would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
