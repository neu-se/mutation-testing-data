  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the result of the `_fulfilled` function, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the result of the `_rejected` function, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the result of the `_rejected` function, even if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
