  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward, potentially revisiting operations that have already been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the iterator to peek at the next element without advancing, potentially causing the iterator to get stuck in an infinite loop.

DONE.
