  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to fail when `parsedUrl.host` is `null` or `undefined`, even if `parsedUrl.protocol` is `'http:'` or `'https:'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to fail when `parsedUrl.protocol` is `'ftp:'` or any other protocol that is not `'http:'` or `'https:'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol == 'http:' || parsedUrl.protocol == 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to succeed when `parsedUrl.protocol` is `'ftp:'` or any other protocol that is not `'http:'` or
