Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return end === true ? acc : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the accumulator `acc` when `end` is `true`, instead of calling the callback `cb`, which may lead to unexpected results in the handling of the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `null` when `end` is `true`, instead of calling the callback `cb`, which means that the final result will not be passed to the callback, potentially causing the program to hang or behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(end, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback `cb` immediately with `end` and `acc`, instead of checking if `end` is true or false, which could lead to premature termination of the processing logic and incorrect handling of the data flow.

DONE.
