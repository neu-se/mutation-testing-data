  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doStuff
```
This would result in different behavior because the `doStuff` function is not defined in the code snippet, and its purpose is not clear. It is possible that it is a user-defined function, but it could also be a typo or a reference to another function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.something
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.something` is a property access expression, which would not be valid in this context. It is possible that the author intended to access a property on the `object` object, but it is not clear what property was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a function that takes a value and returns a resolved Promise with that value. In this context, it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a resolved Promise, which would have different behavior than calling it on an
