  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the real part of the complex number, regardless of whether the imaginary part is zero or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the imaginary part of the complex number plus one, regardless of whether the real part is zero or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return twice the imaginary part of the complex number, regardless of whether the real part is zero or not.

DONE.
