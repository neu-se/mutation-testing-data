  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first segment of the path, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only keep the last segment of the path, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last segment of the path, which may not be intended.

DONE.
