  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex square root function would always return a complex number with a real part of 1, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex square root function would always return a complex number with a real part of -1, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex square root function would return a complex number with a real part that is equal to the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the input, rather than the square root of the real part.

DONE.
