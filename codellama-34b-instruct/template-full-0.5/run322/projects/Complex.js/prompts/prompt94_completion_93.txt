  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because isFinite returns true for any finite number, while isNaN returns true only for NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because !isNaN returns true for any value that is not NaN, while isFinite returns true only for finite numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because Number.isNaN is a more robust check for NaN values, while isFinite may return true for other non-numeric values.

DONE.
