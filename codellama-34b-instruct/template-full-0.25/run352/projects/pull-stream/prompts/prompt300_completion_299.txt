  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, which means that the `cb` function will be called with a truthy value instead of a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will evaluate to `false` if `ended` is truthy, which means that the `cb` function will be called with a falsy value instead of a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will evaluate to `true` if `ended` is truthy, which means that the `cb` function will be called with a truthy value instead of a falsy value.

DONE.
