  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr` and would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a different method than `substr` and would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(0, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different result than the original code fragment, which was `nextOp.insert.substr`.

DONE.
