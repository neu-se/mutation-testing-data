 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `global` object instead of the `module` object, which may not have the same properties depending on the execution context (e.g., in a browser environment).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.module !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `module` property exists in the `global` object, rather than checking the type of the `module` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window.module === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `module` property of the `window` object, which is only available in a browser environment and is likely to be undefined in a Node.js environment.

DONE.
