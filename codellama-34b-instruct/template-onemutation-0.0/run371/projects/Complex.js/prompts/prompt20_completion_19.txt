  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are less than 3000, while the new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is greater than 3000. This would cause the function to return a different value in cases where `a` or `b` is greater than 3000, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors in the program.

DONE.
