  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different value and affect the logic of the `transform` method.

DONE.
