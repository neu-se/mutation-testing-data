  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetFilePath.substring(1)` would return a substring of `targetFilePath` starting from the second character, whereas `targetFilePath` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetFilePath.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of `targetFilePath`, whereas `targetFilePath` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetFilePath.split('/').pop()` would return the last part of `targetFilePath` after splitting it by `/`, whereas `targetFilePath` would return the entire string.

DONE.
