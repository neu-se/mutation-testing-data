  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'please_report_an_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'please_report_an_error' is not a valid event type, and would cause an error to be emitted by the `emit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid event type, and would cause an error to be emitted by the `emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not a valid event type, and would cause an error to be emitted by the `emit` method.

DONE.
