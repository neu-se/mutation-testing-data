  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` parameter of `continuer.bind` would always be set to `"next"`, causing the generator to continue iterating even if an exception was thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` parameter of `continuer.bind` would always be set to `"yield"`, causing the generator to yield the value of the expression instead of resuming execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` parameter of `continuer.bind` would always be set to `"throw"`, causing the error to be thrown and caught when it shouldn't be, or the generator to resume execution when it shouldn't.

DONE.
