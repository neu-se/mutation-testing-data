  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string that contains the string "[object process]".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object Object]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string that contains the string "[object Object]".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return a string that contains the string "[object process]".

DONE.
