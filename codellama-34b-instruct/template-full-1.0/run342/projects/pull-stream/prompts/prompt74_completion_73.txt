  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort && true` is always true if `abort` is truthy, while `abort || true` is only true if `abort` is falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` is always true if `abort` is falsey, while `abort || true` is only true if `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort ? true : false` is always false if `abort` is falsey, while `abort || true` is only true if `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
