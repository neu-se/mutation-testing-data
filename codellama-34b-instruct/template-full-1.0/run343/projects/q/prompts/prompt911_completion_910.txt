  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of `concat`, which would result in a different order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).push(baseArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is used instead of `concat`, which would cause the baseArgs to be pushed onto the end of the argument array instead of being concatenated with it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice().concat(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is used to make a copy of the baseArgs array before concatenating it with the argument array, which would result in a different order of the arguments.

DONE.
