  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "criteria" as the plural form of "criterion", while this code fragment uses the word "criterions" as the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "criteria" as the plural form of "criterion", while this code fragment uses the word "criterion" as the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterionz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "criteria" as the plural form of "criterion", while this code fragment uses the word "criterionz" as the plural form.

DONE.
