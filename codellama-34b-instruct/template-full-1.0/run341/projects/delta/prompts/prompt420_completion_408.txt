  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the index, potentially changing the behavior of the code surrounding the placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the index by 2, which could potentially change the behavior of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(index / 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the index down to the nearest tenth, which could potentially change the behavior of the surrounding code.

DONE.
