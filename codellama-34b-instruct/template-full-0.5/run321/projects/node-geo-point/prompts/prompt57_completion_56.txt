  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, and the calculation of the bearing depends on the difference between the two latitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the first point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, and the calculation of the bearing depends on the difference between the two latitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1)` is the sine of the latitude of the first point, while `φ1` is the latitude itself, and the calculation of the bearing depends on the ratio of the sine of the latitude to the cosine of the longitude.

DONE.
