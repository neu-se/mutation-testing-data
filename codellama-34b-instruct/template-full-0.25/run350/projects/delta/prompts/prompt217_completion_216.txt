  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `ops` array, which could potentially cause the `concat` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `ops` array, which could potentially cause the `concat` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first element of the `ops` array, which could potentially cause the `concat` method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
