  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memorandum'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'memorandum' is a valid plural noun for 'memo', but the code would not recognize it as such.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'memoes' is not a valid spelling for the plural form of 'memo', but the code would recognize it as a mismatch and return 'memoes' instead of 'memos'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memorables'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'memorables' is not a valid plural noun for 'memo', but the code would not recognize it as such.

DONE.
