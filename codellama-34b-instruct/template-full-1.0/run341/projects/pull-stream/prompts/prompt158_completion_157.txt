  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are different values in JavaScript, and the original code fragment used `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value in JavaScript, while `null` is a falsy value but also a constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, which is a falsy value in JavaScript.

DONE.
