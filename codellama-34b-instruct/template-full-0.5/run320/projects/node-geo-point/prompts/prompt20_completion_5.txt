  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object.hasOwnProperty()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than inheriting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== undefined && object.longitude !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` keyword is used to check if a variable is not defined, rather than checking if the object has the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== null && object.longitude !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` keyword is used to check if a variable is not null, rather than checking if the object has the specified property.

DONE.
