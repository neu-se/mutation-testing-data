Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of the `Math.abs` function from `y` to `x`, which would affect the calculation of the hypotenuse, potentially leading to incorrect results when `x` and `y` are different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value passed to `Math.abs` by adding 1 to `y`, which would alter the calculation of the hypotenuse, leading to an incorrect result when `y` is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable used in the `Math.abs` function from `y` to `b`, which is not defined in the context of the `hypot` function, potentially causing a reference error or incorrect calculations if `b` is not properly defined elsewhere.

DONE.
