  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire line, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(thisOp.retain))
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(thisOp.retain))` would retain the entire line, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the current character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(thisOp.retain), AttributeMap.invert(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes))
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(Op.length(thisOp.retain), AttributeMap.invert(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes))` would retain the entire
