  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, whereas the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the length of the string, whereas the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt` method returns the character at the specified index in the string, whereas the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the string.

DONE.
