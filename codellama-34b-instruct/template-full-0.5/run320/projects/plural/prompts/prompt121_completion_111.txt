  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not add the "es" suffix to words ending in "ics", while the modified code fragment would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add the "es" suffix to words ending in "ics", while the modified code fragment would remove the "s" suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/, 'ic') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add the "es" suffix to words ending in "ics", while the modified code fragment would replace the "ics" suffix with "ic".

DONE.
