  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` are not equal, regardless of their types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData && typeof thisData === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` are not equal and `thisData` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData && typeof thisData === 'object' && thisData !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `thisData` and `otherData` are not equal, `thisData` is an object, and `thisData` is not null.

DONE.
