  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index is less than 0 instead of greater than 0, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the index is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index is equal to 0 instead of greater than 0, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the index is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index is even instead of greater than 0, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` for odd indices.

DONE.
