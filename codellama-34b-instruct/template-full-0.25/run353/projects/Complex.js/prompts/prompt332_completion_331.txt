  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, while the new code checks if `b` is equal to -1. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `b` is equal to 1, even though the original code would have evaluated to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, while the new code checks if `a` is equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `a` is not equal to 0, even though the original code would have evaluated to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 1, while the new code
