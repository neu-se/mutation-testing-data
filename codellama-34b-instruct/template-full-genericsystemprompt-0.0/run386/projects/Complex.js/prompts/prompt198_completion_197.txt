  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `a` and `b`, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of `z` instead of the real part, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of `z` instead of the real part, which could cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
