  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterias')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment adds it as "criterias".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterion')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment adds it as "criterion".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterions')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while the new code fragment adds it as "criterions".

DONE.
