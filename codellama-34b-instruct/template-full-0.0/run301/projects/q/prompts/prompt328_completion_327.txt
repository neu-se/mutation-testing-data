  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _fulfilled(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _rejected(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `promise` object, which would execute the callback functions `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` when the promise is resolved or rejected, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return _rejected(value);
}, function (exception) {
    return _fulfilled(exception);
});
```
