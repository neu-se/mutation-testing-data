  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value in the `_data` map directly, instead of using the `set` method to update the value and persist it to disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key + '1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value at the key `key + '1'`, instead of the value at the key `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value at the key `key` by adding 1 to it, instead of using the `updater` function to update the value.

DONE.
