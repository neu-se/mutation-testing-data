  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called with the `promise` object as its context, so `inspect.state` would refer to the `state` property of the `inspect` method, which is not the same as the `state` property of the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is called on the `inspect` object, which is not the same as the `valueOf` method of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called with the `promise` object as its context, so `promise.inspect.state` would refer to the `state` property of the `inspect` method, which is not the same
