  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, "Invalid");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an additional argument, `"Invalid"`, which would cause it to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, "Invalid", name);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with the arguments in a different order, causing it to return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with a null value for the third argument, which would cause it to return a different timezone object.

DONE.
