  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would change the order of the elements in the `desiredLines` array, which would affect the final concatenated stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(0, 1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would only include the first element of the `desiredLines` array in the final concatenated stack trace, while the original code fragment includes all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["extra line"]).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add an extra line to the `desiredLines` array, which would affect the final concatenated stack trace.

DONE.
