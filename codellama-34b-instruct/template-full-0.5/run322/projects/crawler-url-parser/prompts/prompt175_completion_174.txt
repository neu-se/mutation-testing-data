  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the URL with a different set of options, potentially returning a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the URL without the `strict` option, potentially returning a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, {strict: false});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the URL with a different set of options, potentially returning a different result.

DONE.
