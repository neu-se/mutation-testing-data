  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$2')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\$2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$&')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\$&`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\$2`.

DONE.
