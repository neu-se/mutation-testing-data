  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function to `cork`, which is a callback that will be called when the stream is uncorked. In contrast, `true` is a boolean value that will be interpreted as a truthy value, which will cause the stream to be corked indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value that will cause the stream to be uncorked immediately, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size` is a number that represents the number of items in the queue, and passing it to `cork` will cause the stream to
