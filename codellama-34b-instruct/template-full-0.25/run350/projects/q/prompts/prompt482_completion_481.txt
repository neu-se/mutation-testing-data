  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `unhandledReasons` array to be spliced at index `1`, removing the first element of the array. With the replacement code fragment `0`, the array would be spliced at index `0`, removing the last element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `unhandledReasons` array to be spliced at index `1`, removing the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `unhandledRe
