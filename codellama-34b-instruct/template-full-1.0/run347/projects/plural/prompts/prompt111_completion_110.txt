  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' | '
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an extra space character in the middle of the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the "|" character, resulting in a different regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
', '
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an extra comma character in the middle of the regular expression.

DONE.
