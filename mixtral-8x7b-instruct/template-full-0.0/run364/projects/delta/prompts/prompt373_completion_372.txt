 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, while the original code fragment `thisIter.next()` advances the iterator. This change could cause an infinite loop if the peeked operation is an insertion, as the loop condition checks for `thisIter.hasNext()`, which would still return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(0)` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, effectively creating a no-op. This change could cause the loop to skip some operations, leading to incorrect behavior or test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.previous()` is not a valid method on the Op
