  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` method would receive an `undefined` object, which would lead to an error.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` method would receive an empty object, which would lead to a different outcome.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` method would receive a `null` object, which would lead to a different outcome.

DONE.
