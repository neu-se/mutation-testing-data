 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof tokens[i + 1] === 'string' && (tokens[i + 1].toLowerCase() === 'i' || tokens[i + 1].toLowerCase() === 'j')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider both 'i' and 'j' as valid imaginary parts, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['i', 'j'].includes(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider both 'i' and 'j' as valid imaginary parts, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tokens[i + 1].toLowerCase() === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only 'i' (in lowercase) as a valid imaginary part, while the original code considers both 'i' and 'I'.
