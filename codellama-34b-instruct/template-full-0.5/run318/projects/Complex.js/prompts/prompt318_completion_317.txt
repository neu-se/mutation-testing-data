  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `b`, which is not the same as simply using `b` as the divisor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be doubled, which is not the same as simply using `b` as the divisor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` will be increased by 1, which is not the same as simply using `b` as the divisor.

DONE.
