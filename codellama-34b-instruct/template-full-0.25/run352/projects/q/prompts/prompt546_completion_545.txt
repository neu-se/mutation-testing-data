  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is an argument passed to the `continuer` function, which is used to continue the execution of the generator function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the generator function to receive a `null` value instead of the expected argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is an argument passed to the `continuer` function, which is used to continue the execution of the generator function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the generator function to receive an `undefined` value instead of the expected argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is an argument passed to the `continuer` function, which is
