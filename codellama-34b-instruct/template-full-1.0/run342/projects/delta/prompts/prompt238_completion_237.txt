  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` will always return the largest of the values, whereas `Math.min` will always return the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` will return a random floating point number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.min` will return the smallest of the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` will return the square root of the value, whereas `Math.min` will return the smallest of the two values.

DONE.
