  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment called it with `this` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(true, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with `true` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment called it with `this` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(this, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would be called with `this` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment called it with `null` as the first argument.

DONE.
