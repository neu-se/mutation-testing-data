  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator, while this replacement uses a logical OR operator. This would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, potentially leading to errors in the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator, while this replacement uses a logical AND operator with a negated second condition. This would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, potentially leading to errors in the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 || _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator, while this replacement uses a logical
