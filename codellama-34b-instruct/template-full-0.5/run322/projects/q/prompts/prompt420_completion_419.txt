  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns a promise state object, which has a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected". By checking for "rejected", we are checking if the promise is in a rejected state, which is different from the original code that checks for "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method returns a promise state object, which has a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected". By checking for "pending", we are checking if the promise is still pending, which is different from the original code that checks for "fulfilled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result
