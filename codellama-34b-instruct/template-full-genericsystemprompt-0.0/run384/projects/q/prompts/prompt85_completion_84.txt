  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function passed to `requestTick` would not have the same behavior as the original `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is not a function, it's a variable that holds a function.

DONE.
