  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative` checks if the path is relative, while `path.isAbsolute` checks if the path is absolute. If the path is relative, the code would not reject the promise as it should, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
