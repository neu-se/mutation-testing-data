  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the suffix "-es" to the word "goose" to form the plural, while this code fragment adds the suffix "-s" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'goose')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the suffix "-es" to the word "goose" to form the plural, while this code fragment does not add any suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the suffix "-es" to the word "goose" to form the plural, while this code fragment adds the suffix "-s" to the word "geese" instead.

DONE.
