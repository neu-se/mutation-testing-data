  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Promise.defer>
```
This would result in different behavior because <Promise.defer> is not a function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<null>
```
This would result in different behavior because <null> is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<undefined>
```
This would result in different behavior because <undefined> is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
