  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```process.on```
This would result in different behavior because `process.on` is a different function that is not used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```promise.then(function(){})```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` is a function that is not used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```console.log('unhandledRejection', reason, promise)```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log()` is a logging function that is not used in the original code.

DONE.
