  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the result of the `test` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(ended)` would be called regardless of the result of the `test` function and would pass the `ended` value as an argument to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of
