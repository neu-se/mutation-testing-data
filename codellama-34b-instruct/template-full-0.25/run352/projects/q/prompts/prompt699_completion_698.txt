  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `array_slice` function would be `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined in the function, and using it would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which would cause it to return a different slice of the `arguments` array.

DONE.
