  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(v) { return v; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(v) { return v + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the modified code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(v) { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the modified code fragment throws an error when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
