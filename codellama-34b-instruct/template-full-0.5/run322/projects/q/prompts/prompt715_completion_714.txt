  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.length` would return the length of the object, whereas `object` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the object, whereas `object` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.toString()` would return a string representation of the object, whereas `object` would return the object itself.

DONE.
