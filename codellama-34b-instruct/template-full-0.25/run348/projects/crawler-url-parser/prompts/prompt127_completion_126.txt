  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.protocol` is a different property than `linkurl`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.host` is a different property than `linkurl`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.pathname` is a different property than `linkurl`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

DONE.
