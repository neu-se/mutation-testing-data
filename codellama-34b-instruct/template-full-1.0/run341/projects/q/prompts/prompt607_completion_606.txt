  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the incremented op value may cause the application to lose control over the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the decremented op value may cause the application to miss the execution of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the doubled op value may cause the application to execute the operation twice.

DONE.
