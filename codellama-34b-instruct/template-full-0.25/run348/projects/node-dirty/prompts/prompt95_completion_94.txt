  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `JSON.parse()` method to parse the JSON string, which would result in a string with the same case as the original string. However, using the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string to uppercase, which would result in a different object being parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `JSON.parse()` method to parse the JSON string, which would result in a string with the same case as the original string. However, using the `split()` method would split the string into an array of characters, which would result in a different object being parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.replace('key', 'value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `JSON.parse()` method to parse the JSON
