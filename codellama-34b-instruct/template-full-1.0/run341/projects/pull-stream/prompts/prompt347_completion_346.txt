  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is not necessarily an object, while `data[key]` assumes that `data` is an object with a property corresponding to the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is not necessarily a string, while `key + ''` always results in a string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is not necessarily a random value, while `Math.random()` is a function that generates a random number between 0 and 1.

DONE.
