  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces all instances of the letter "a" with "e", while the new code fragment only replaces the first instance of "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces all instances of the letter "a" with "e", while the new code fragment only replaces the first instance of "a".
