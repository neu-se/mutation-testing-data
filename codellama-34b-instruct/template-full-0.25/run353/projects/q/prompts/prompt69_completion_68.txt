  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` is a different port than `port2`, and `postMessage` is a different method than `onmessage`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.onmessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `onmessage` is a different method than `postMessage`, and it would not be called with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `onmessage` is a different method than `postMessage`, and it would not be called with the same arguments.

DONE.
