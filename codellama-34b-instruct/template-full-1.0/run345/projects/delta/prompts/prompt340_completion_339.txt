  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` in the original code fragment is used to determine the length of the slice, while `baseIndex + 100` would result in a much larger slice, potentially including unexpected elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` in the original code fragment is used to determine the length of the slice, while `baseIndex + 1, baseIndex` would result in a slice of length 0, potentially causing the code to skip over important elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex + 1` in the original code fragment is used to determine the length of the slice, while `baseIndex + 1, base
