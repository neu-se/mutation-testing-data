 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.log('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because it prints a message instead of throwing an error, which might not be expected by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Complex.NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a specific `Complex.NaN` value instead of a plain `NaN`, which might not be properly handled by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an `Error` object instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which might not be properly caught and handled by the test suite.

DONE.
