  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `_flush` method with an empty array, causing the `set` method to fail when trying to call the `_flush` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `_flush` method with an empty function, causing the `set` method to fail when trying to call the `_flush` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush = setTimeout(function() {}, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `_flush` method with a timeout function that does nothing, causing the `set` method to fail when trying to call the `_flush` method.

DONE.
