  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the sqrt() function would return 0, even if the input value is non-zero, which would cause any subsequent calculations that use the result of sqrt() to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the sqrt() function would return Infinity, even if the input value is non-zero, which would cause any subsequent calculations that use the result of sqrt() to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the sqrt() function would return NaN, even if the input value is non-zero, which would cause any subsequent calculations that use the result of sqrt() to return incorrect results.

DONE.
