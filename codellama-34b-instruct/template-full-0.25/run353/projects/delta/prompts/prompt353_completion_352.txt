  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `inverted` object, which is an instance of the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is not defined on the `inverted` object, which is an instance of the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method is not defined on the `inverted` object, which is an instance of the `Delta` class.

DONE.
