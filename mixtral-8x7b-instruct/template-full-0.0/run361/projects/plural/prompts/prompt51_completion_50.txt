 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends a single 'e' instead of 'es', which would cause incorrect pluralization for words that should end in 'es' in their plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'ES' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now converts the input word to uppercase and appends 'ES', which would cause incorrect pluralization and case changes for words that should be in title case or lowercase in their plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now removes the last character of the input word and appends 'x', which would cause incorrect pluralization for words that
