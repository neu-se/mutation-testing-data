Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation from `thisOp` instead of the corresponding operation from `otherOp`, potentially leading to incorrect delta operations being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value into the delta instead of the actual operation from `otherOp`, which would likely cause issues in the delta's structure and lead to unexpected results when processing the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the attributes of `otherOp` instead of the entire operation, which would change the intended operation being represented in the delta and could lead to incorrect transformations or representations of the data.

DONE.
