Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first argument of `nodeArgs` to the function, potentially omitting necessary arguments that the callback requires.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the `nodeArgs`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when the callback is executed, as it may not handle `null` as a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(arg => arg * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies each argument in `nodeArgs` by multiplying it by 2, which could change the intended values passed to the callback, leading to incorrect behavior or results.

DONE.
