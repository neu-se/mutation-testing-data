  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the array, instead of removing all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { return x * 2; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double all elements in the array, instead of removing all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(function (x) { return x !== 42; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements that are not equal to 42, instead of removing all elements.

DONE.
