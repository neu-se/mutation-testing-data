  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is removed, causing the regular expression to become case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, causing the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, and also to treat the input string as multiple lines.

DONE.
