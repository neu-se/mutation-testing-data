  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is replaced with the `set` method, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value of the property instead of the property itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is replaced with the `delete` method, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value of the property instead of the property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is replaced with the `post` method, which would cause the promise to resolve with the value of the property instead of the property itself.

DONE.
