  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` argument would be passed to the `cb` function, but the original code fragment passed the `err` argument instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` argument would be passed to the `cb` function as the first argument, but the original code fragment passed it as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value would be passed to the `cb` function as the first argument, but the original code fragment passed it as the second argument. Additionally, the `data` argument would be passed as the second argument, but the original code fragment passed `err` instead.

DONE.
