  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called with the correct arguments. The original code calls `reject` with the `exception` and `self` arguments, which is necessary for the promise to be rejected correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a different argument. The original code calls `reject` with the `exception` argument, which is an instance of the `Error` class. This change would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception, self);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a different number of arguments. The original code calls `reject` with two arguments, `exception` and `self`. This change would cause the promise to be rejected
