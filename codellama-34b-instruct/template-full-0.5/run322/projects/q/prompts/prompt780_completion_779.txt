  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject()` will cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `regardless` will cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve()` will cause the promise to be fulfilled, whereas `regardless` will cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.notify()` will cause the promise to be notified, whereas `regardless` will cause the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
