  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `a`, while the modified code fragment returns `a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `a`, while the modified code fragment returns `a - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `a`, while the modified code fragment returns `a * 2`.

DONE.
