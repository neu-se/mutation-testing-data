  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.readFile` is a different function from `fs.promises.access`. The former reads the contents of a file, while the latter checks if a file exists and is accessible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.writeFile` is a different function from `fs.promises.access`. The former writes data to a file, while the latter checks if a file exists and is accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.unlink
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.unlink` is a different function from `fs.promises.access`. The former deletes a file, while the latter checks if a file exists and is accessible.

DONE.
