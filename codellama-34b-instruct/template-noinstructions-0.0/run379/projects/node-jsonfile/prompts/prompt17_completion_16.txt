  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is an object. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` argument is not a string, but is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is a function. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` argument is not a string, but is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This could cause the function to behave differently if the `options` argument is not a string, but is
