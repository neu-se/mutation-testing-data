 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(object, ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` does not have a `timeout` method, and it would raise a `TypeError` when called with three arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(object).timeout(ms, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(object)` creates a new promise that is immediately resolved with the value of `object`, and then the `timeout` method is called on that new promise. This would cause the original promise to be "detached" from the timeout mechanism, and the timeout behavior might not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify(setTimeout)(ms, Q.resolve(object), error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` converts a Node.js-style callback-based function
