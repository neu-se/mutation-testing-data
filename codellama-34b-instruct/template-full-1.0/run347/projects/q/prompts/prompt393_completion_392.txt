  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` is a promise library that can be used to create promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is already rejected with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that can be used to create promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with an empty object, whereas `Q` is a promise library that can be used to create promises.

DONE.
