  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp ?? otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `??` operator would return the first truthy value, which would change the contents of the `newOp` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp * otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would perform multiplication, which would change the value of `newOp` and potentially cause errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp + otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would perform concatenation, which would change the value of `newOp` and potentially cause errors in the code.

DONE.
