  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not the same as the `null` value, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as the `data` value, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` value is not the same as the `null` value, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
