 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root by using the absolute value instead of the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(b / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an exponential function with half of the imaginary part instead of the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns zero as the imaginary part of the square root, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
