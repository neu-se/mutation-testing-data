  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 'dwarf' or 'roof', while this code fragment checks for inequality with 'dwarf' and 'roof'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!w.includes('dwarf') && !w.includes('roof')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 'dwarf' or 'roof', while this code fragment checks if 'dwarf' or 'roof' are included in the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.match(/dwarf|roof/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 'dwarf' or 'roof', while this code fragment checks if the word matches the regular expression /dwarf|roof/.
