Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not increment the index `i`, causing the function to always return the same element from the array on subsequent calls instead of moving to the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next element in the array without incrementing `i`, which could lead to skipping elements and potentially accessing an undefined value if `i` is already at the last index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the previous element in the array instead of the current one, which could lead to returning an incorrect value or undefined if `i` is 0.

DONE.
