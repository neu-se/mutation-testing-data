  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only objects that are not empty, whereas the original code matches any object that is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only if the retain property is a function, whereas the original code matches any object or function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'symbol'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only if the retain property is a symbol, whereas the original code matches any object, function, or symbol.

DONE.
