  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf("<div>", -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the last occurrence of "<div>" in the chunk, instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf("<p>")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for the last occurrence of "<p>" in the chunk, instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes("<li>")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the chunk includes the string "<li>", while the original code searched for the first occurrence of "<div>".

DONE.
