Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the encoding to 'utf8' regardless of what the user specified in the `options` object, potentially leading to incorrect file reading if a different encoding was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync` would ignore any options provided, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the file requires specific reading options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'ascii' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the encoding to 'ascii', which may not correctly handle characters outside the ASCII range, leading to data loss or corruption when reading files that contain such characters.

DONE.
