  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the sine of the complex number, while the modified code calculates the negative sine of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the sine of the complex number, while the modified code calculates the sine of the complex number plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the sine of the complex number, while the modified code calculates the sine of the complex number multiplied by pi.

DONE.
