  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `!resolvedPromise` returns `true` if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, which means it could be `null`, `undefined`, `false`, etc. By replacing it with `resolvedPromise !== true`, the code would only return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `!resolvedPromise` checks if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, which means it could be `null`, `undefined`, `false`, etc. By replacing it with `typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"`, the code would only return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!resolvedPromise
