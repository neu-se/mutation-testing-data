  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which creates a new resolver object, while this replacement uses `deferred.reject`, which rejects the promise with the specified error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(arguments, 0)`, which returns an array with all arguments, while this replacement uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which returns an array with only the last two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice(arguments, 0)`, which returns an array with all arguments, while this replacement uses `[]`, which returns an empty array.

DONE.
