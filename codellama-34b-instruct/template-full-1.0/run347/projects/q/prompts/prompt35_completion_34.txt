  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw e;` will always throw the current error object, regardless of whether it was previously captured or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error();` will throw a new error object that is not the same as the one that was previously captured.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve().then(() => { throw e; });
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve().then()` will schedule the throw to happen on the next tick of the event loop, potentially causing the error to be caught by a different try-catch block or by the global error handler.

DONE.
