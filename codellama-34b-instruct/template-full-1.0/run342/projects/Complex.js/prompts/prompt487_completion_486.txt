  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex + Complex;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add two complex numbers, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex - Complex;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract two complex numbers, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex * Complex;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply two complex numbers, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
