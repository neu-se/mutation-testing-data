  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `b`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the difference between `a` and `b`, regardless of the value of `a`.

DONE.
