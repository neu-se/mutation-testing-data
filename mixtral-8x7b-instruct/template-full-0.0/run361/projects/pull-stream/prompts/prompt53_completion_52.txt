 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the 's' variable in the global 'window' object, instead of checking if 's' is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 's' is an instance of the built-in Object constructor, instead of checking if 's' is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.prototype === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 's' is an object with a 'prototype' property that is also an object, instead of checking if 's' is simply an object.

DONE.
