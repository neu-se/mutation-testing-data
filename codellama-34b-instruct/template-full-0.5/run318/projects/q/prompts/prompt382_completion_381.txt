  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method and cannot be used as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method and cannot be used as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `1` is a primitive value that does not have a `then` method and cannot be used as a promise.

DONE.
