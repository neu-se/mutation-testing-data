  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original data, while this new code fragment returns the data plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original data, while this new code fragment returns the data multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original data, while this new code fragment returns the data converted to a string.

DONE.
