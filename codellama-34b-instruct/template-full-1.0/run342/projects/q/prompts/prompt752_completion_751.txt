  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ message: "Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + err.message }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different than the original, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ message: "Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + err }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is not the same as the original, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ message: "Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: none" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is not the same as the original, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
