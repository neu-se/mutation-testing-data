  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
20, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the base of the logarithm from 10 to 20.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the default value of the `places` parameter from 0 to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `places` parameter before using it in the logarithm.

DONE.
