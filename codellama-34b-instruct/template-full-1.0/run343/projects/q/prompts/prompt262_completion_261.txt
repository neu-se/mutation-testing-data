  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to always resolve immediately, rather than waiting for the `become` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => reject());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to always reject immediately, rather than waiting for the `become` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    throw Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, rather than waiting for the `become` function to be called.

DONE.
