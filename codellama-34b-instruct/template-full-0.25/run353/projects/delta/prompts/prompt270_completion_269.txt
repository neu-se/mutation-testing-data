  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the original code, potentially causing the algorithm to skip over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one fewer character than the original code, potentially causing the algorithm to perform an unnecessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain twice as many characters as the original code, potentially causing the algorithm to perform twice as many operations.

DONE.
