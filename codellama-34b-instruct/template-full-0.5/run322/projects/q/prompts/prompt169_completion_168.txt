  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a function that returns a boolean value, whereas `isInternalFrame` is a variable that contains a boolean value.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isInternalFrame` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `isInternalFrame`, whereas `isInternalFrame()` is a function that returns a boolean value.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame !== true` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `isInternalFrame`, whereas `isInternalFrame()` is a function that returns a boolean value.

DONE.
