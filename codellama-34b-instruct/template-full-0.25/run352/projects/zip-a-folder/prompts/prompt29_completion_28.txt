  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with an error message instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an error instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with `null` instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the expected result.

DONE.
