  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is operating on the latitude of the first point, rather than the second point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(-1) * point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is operating on the negative of the latitude of the second point, which is different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is operating on the longitude of the second point, which is different from the original code.

DONE.
