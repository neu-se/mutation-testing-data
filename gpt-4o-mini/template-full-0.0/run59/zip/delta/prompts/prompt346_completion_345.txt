Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the intended `opData` to `baseOpData`, potentially leading to incorrect transformations based on the wrong data context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `opData` would likely cause the handler's `invert` method to behave unexpectedly, possibly resulting in an error or incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `opData` may lead to different handling in the `invert` method, which could cause it to skip processing or produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
