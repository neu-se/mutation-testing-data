  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator.next(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator.next()` is a method that returns the next value in the iteration, whereas `generator[verb](arg)` is a method that returns the next value in the iteration, but also handles errors and exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator[verb](arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator[verb](arg)` is a method that returns the next value in the iteration, but also handles errors and exceptions, whereas `generator.next()` is a method that returns the next value in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = generator.throw(arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because `generator.throw()` is a method that throws an exception, whereas `generator[verb](arg)` is a method that returns the next value in the iteration.

DONE.
