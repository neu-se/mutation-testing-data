  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original promise object instead of an object with the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise instead of an object with the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason of the promise instead of the state of the promise.

DONE.
