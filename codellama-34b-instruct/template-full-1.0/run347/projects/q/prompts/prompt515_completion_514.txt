  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick.run(function () {
```
This would result in different behavior because `run` is a property of `Q.nextTick`, and it expects a function as its argument. The code would still work, but it would be more readable and easier to understand if it was written as `Q.nextTick(function () {`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () { return function () {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` does not return a function, so the code would error out.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick().runAfter(function () {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` returns a promise, and promises do not have a `runAfter` method. The code would still work, but it would be more readable and easier to understand if it was written as `Q.nextTick
