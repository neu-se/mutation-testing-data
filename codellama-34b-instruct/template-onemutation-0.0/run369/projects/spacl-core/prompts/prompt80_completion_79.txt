  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the rule matches the given path, while `matches` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the rule matches the given path and context.

DONE.
