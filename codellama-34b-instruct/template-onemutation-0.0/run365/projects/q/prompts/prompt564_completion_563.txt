  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a method of the `Promise` object that rejects the promise with a reason. Using `throw` instead of `reject` would cause the code to throw an exception instead of rejecting the promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
