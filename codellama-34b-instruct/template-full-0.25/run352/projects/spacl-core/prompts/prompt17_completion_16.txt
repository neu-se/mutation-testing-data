  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.0');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is being called with a different version argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.1');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is being called with a different version argument.

DONE.
