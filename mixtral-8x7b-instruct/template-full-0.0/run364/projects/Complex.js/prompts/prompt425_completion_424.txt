 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement always returns `false` for the `inverse` method's second condition, whereas the original code checks if the current complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement lacks the required parameter for the `isInfinite` method, causing an error in the `inverse` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite('not a number')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement passes an incorrect argument type to the `isInfinite` method, which would cause unexpected behavior or an error in the `inverse` method.

DONE.
