  Sure, here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ys' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the suffix "ys" instead of "es" to words that match the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the suffix "s" followed by "es" instead of just "es" to words that match the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the suffix "s" followed by "s" instead of just "es" to words that match the regular expression.

DONE.
