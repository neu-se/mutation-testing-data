 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.split("\n").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of lines in the stack trace, instead of the index of the first line break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.split("\n")[1]
