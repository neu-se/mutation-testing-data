  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r)` to handle the case where `r > 1`, which can occur due to floating point errors. However, `acos(r)` would produce `NaN` in this case, which would cause the function to return `NaN` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `asin` to calculate the bearing, which produces a result in the range of -180 to 180. However, `asin(r)` would produce a result in the range of -90 to 90, which is not equivalent to the original calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2` to calculate the bearing
