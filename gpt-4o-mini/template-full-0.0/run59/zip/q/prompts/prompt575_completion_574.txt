Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and arguments, which would not preserve the context of `continuer` as intended, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when handling the generator's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, and if the arguments are not passed as an array, it could lead to unexpected results or errors when the generator function is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because binding `null` as the context would prevent the `continuer` function from accessing the correct `this` context, which could lead to failures in resolving promises or handling errors correctly.

DONE.
