Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `thisp` would cause the `apply` method to lose its context, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior when accessing properties or methods on the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `thisp` would also cause the `apply` method to lose its context, similar to using `null`, and may result in runtime errors if the method being called expects a valid context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because using `value` instead of `thisp` would change the context of the function being applied, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the function relies on the original context of `thisp`.

DONE.
