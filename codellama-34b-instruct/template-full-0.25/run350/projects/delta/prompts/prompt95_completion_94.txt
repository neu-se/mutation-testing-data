  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `splice` inserts an element at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `splice` inserts an element at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` inserts an element at a specific index, whereas `push` and `unshift` add elements to the end or beginning of the array.

DONE.
