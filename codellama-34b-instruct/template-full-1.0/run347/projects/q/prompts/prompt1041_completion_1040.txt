  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.resolve(ends. promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with a new object containing the `head` and `tail` properties, while this new code resolves the promise with the `ends.promise` object itself. This would change the behavior of the `put` method, causing it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new error object with a specific message, while this new code rejects the promise with a generic error object. This would change the behavior of the `put` method, causing it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.resolve({head: value, tail: ends.promise})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new object with
