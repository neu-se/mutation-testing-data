  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` is a variable that represents the length of an operation, but multiplying it by 2 would double the length, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the modified operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` is a variable that represents the length of an operation, but adding 1 to it would increase the length by 1, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the modified operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` is a variable that represents the length of an operation, but subtracting 1 from it would decrease the length by 1, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the modified operation.

DONE.
