  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with a constant value of 1, which would cause the function to always return the same result regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be used instead of `cos`, which would cause the function to return different results for the same input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(1 - x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 - x` would be used instead of `x` as the argument for the `cos` function, which would cause the function to return different results for the same input values.

DONE.
