  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile` is a different function than `_readFile`, and it has a different purpose. `_writeFile` is used to write a file to disk, while `_readFile` is used to read a file from disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `readFile`, and it has a different purpose. `readFileSync` is used to read a file from disk in a synchronous manner, while `readFile` is used to read a file from disk in an asynchronous manner.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `writeFile`, and it has a different purpose. `writeFileSync` is used to write a file to disk in a synchronous manner, while `writeFile`
