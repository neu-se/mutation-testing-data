  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `defer` is a function call that creates a new deferred object, while `deferred.resolve()` is a method call that resolves the deferred object with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `defer` is a function call that creates a new deferred object, while `deferred.reject()` is a method call that rejects the deferred object with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `defer` is a function call that creates a new deferred object, while `deferred.promise` is a property that returns the promise associated with the deferred object.

DONE.
