  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments array `args` is not guaranteed to have a second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function that can be applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is not a function that can be applied.

DONE.
