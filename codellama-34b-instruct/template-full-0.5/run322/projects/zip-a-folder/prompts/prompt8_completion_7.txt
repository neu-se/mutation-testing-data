  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the target base path is equal to the source path, while this modified code checks if they are not equal. This would cause the code to throw an error even if the target base path is not the same as the source path, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the target base path is equal to the source path, while this modified code checks if the source path is included in the target base path. This would cause the code to throw an error even if the source path is a subdirectory of the target base path, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!targetBasePath.startsWith(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the target base path is equal to the source path,
