  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `ctx` is not `undefined`, which would result in the `return false` statement being executed, even if the `match` variable is not `null`.

DONE.
