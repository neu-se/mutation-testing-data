  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which is a function. In the original code, `cb` is called when `end` is false and `test(data)` is true. However, with the modified code, `cb` is called when `end` is true and `test(data)` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas in the original code, `cb` is called without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with only the `data` argument, whereas in the original code, `cb` is called with both the `end` and `data` arguments.

DONE.
