  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 and if it is not undefined. This means that if `num` is undefined, the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, while this new code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined. This means that if `num` is undefined, the original code fragment would return the plural form of the word, while this new code fragment would return the singular form.
