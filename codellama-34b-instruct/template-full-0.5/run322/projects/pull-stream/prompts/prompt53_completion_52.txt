  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `source` property of the `s` object instead of the `s` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.sink === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `sink` property of the `s` object instead of the `s` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.source.sink === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `sink` property of the `source` property of the `s` object instead of the `s` object itself.

DONE.
