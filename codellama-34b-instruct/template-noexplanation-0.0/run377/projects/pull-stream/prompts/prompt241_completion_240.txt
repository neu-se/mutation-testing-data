  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which is different from the original code fragment where `data` was passed as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which is different from the original code fragment where `data` was passed as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with the string `"foo"` as the second argument, which is different from the original code fragment where `data` was passed as the second argument.

DONE.
