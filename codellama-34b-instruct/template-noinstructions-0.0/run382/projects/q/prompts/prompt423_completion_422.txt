  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function and `object.inspect()` is a function call, which would return the result of the function instead of the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.bind(object)` is a bound function, which would return a new function that is bound to the `object` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect.call(object)` is a function call that is bound to the `object` context, which would return the result of the function call.

DONE.
