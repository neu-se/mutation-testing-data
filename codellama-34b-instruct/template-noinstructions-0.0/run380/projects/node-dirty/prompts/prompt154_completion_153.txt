  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork()` without any arguments, which means it would uncork the stream without any specific behavior. However, by adding `true` as an argument, it would uncork the stream and also flush any buffered data, which could cause different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `this._writeStream.uncork()` without any arguments, which means it would uncork the stream without any specific behavior. However, by adding `false` as an argument, it would uncork the stream but not flush any buffered data, which could cause different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(null);
```
This would result in
