  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejector` will reject the promise, while `makeNodeResolver` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodePromise(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodePromise(false)` will return a promise that is rejected, while `makeNodeResolver` would return a promise that is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodePromise(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodePromise(2)` will return a promise that is resolved with the value 2, while `makeNodeResolver` would return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
