  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(otherIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.retain()` would retain the characters from the other iterator, while `retDelta.push(otherIter.next(opLength))` would push the characters to the delta, which could result in different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(otherIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete()` would delete the characters from the other iterator, while `retDelta.push(otherIter.next(opLength))` would push the characters to the delta, which could result in different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength).delete();
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(opLength).delete()` would delete the characters from the other iterator, while `retDelta.push(
