  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception)` would reject the promise with the exception, while the new code fragment `return resolve(exception)` would resolve the promise with the exception, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Rejected"));

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception)` would reject the promise with the exception, while the new code fragment `return Q.reject
