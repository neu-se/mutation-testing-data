  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `callback` function, rather than all of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to the `callback` function, rather than all of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as a single argument to the `callback` function, rather than passing each element of the array as a separate argument.

DONE.
