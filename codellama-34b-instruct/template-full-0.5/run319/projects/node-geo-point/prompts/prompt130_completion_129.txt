  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the class, while `null` would result in a null reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the class, while `undefined` would result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` refers to the current instance of the class, while `{}` would result in a type error.

DONE.
