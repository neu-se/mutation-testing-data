  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because "del" is a reserved word in JavaScript and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because "remove" is not a valid method for deleting a property in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deleteProperty"
```
This would result in different behavior because "deleteProperty" is a valid method for deleting a property in JavaScript, but it would not work in this context because it is not a method of the `Q` object.

DONE.
