  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.madeupproperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object does not have a `madeupproperty` property, so the value of `currentUrl.madeupproperty` would be `undefined`, causing the `urlMap.set()` method to not set the `currentUrl` object as a value in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is different from the `currentUrl` object, so the `urlMap.set()` method would set the `currentUrl` object with the `null` value, which would cause the `urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)` method to return `false` and the `urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr)` method to not delete the `currentUrl` object from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is different from the `currentUrl` object
