  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is not an insert, while the modified code fragment checks if the next operation is an insert. This change would cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently when encountering an insert operation.

DONE.
