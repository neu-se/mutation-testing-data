  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the format of the archive is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', customWriteStream: output}
```
This would result in different behavior because the custom write stream is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', someUnexpectedOption: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the someUnexpectedOption is not a valid option for the archiver.

DONE.
