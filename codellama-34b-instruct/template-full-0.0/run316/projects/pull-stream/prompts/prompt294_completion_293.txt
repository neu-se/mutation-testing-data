  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is not being checked in the original code, so the `terminate` function would not be called in the same cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not being called with the correct arguments in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable is not being checked in the original code, so the `cb` function would not be called in the same cases.

DONE.
