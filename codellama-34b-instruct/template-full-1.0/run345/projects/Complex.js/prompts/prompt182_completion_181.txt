  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while the replaced code fragment sets the imaginary part to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the real part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the imaginary part is non-negative, while the replaced code fragment checks whether the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative.

DONE.
