 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{href: baseUrlStr}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the href to the baseUrlStr, instead of parsing it first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parse('some_random_string')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to parse a static string, which would likely fail and return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
href || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator, which would always use the baseUrlStr if the href is falsy (e.g., null, undefined, or an empty string), even if the href is a valid URL.

DONE.
