  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is always equal to `0`, so the result would always be `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is always equal to `0`, so the result would always be `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is always equal to `0`, so the result would always be `0`.

DONE.
