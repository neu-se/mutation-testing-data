  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would therefore throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ninvoke` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would therefore throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nsend(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nsend` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would therefore throw an error.

DONE.
