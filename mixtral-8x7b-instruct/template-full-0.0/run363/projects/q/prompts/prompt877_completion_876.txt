 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.nextTick.bind(process)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately invokes `process.nextTick` instead of using the `nodeArgs` array as the arguments for the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `nodeArgs` array with a hardcoded array, causing the callback to be called with incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls `deferred.resolve` instead of wrapping it in a function, causing the promise to be immediately resolved with `undefined` as the value.

DONE.
