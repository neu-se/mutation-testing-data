  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two objects are not the same object, rather than checking if they are both objects and have the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.constructor !== otherData.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two objects have the same constructor, rather than checking if they are both objects and have the same type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(thisData) !== Object.getPrototypeOf(otherData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the two objects have the same prototype, rather than checking if they are both objects and have the same type.

DONE.
