Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the multiplication operation to addition, which will yield a different result for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * -places
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the product of the imaginary part and places, effectively flipping the sign of the imaginary component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, leading to a completely different calculation for the imaginary component.

DONE.
