  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "Null" instead of the expected type of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return "Undefined" instead of the expected type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a random number instead of the expected type of the object.

DONE.
