  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` whenever `a` and `b` are equal, regardless of their types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to the sum of `a` and `b`, regardless of their types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to the product of `a` and `b`, regardless of their types.

DONE.
