  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, regardless of the resolution status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always notify the promise, regardless of the resolution status.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(new Value())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with a new instance of Value, regardless of the resolution status.

DONE.
