  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method that is not intended to be used in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a different method that is not intended to be used in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different method that is not intended to be used in this context.

DONE.
