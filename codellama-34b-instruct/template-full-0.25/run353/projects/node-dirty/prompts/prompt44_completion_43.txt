  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` returns the value associated with the key, whereas `set` stores a value at a key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` removes the key-value pair associated with the key, whereas `set` stores a value at a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` updates the value associated with the key, whereas `set` stores a value at a key.

DONE.
