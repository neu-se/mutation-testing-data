  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses" for the word "thesis", but the mutated code fragment would return "these" for the same word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses" for the word "thesis", but the mutated code fragment would return "thies" for the same word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result
