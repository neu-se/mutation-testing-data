  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `length` property to determine the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `length` property to determine the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing a subset of the original array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `length` property to determine the length of the array.

DONE.
