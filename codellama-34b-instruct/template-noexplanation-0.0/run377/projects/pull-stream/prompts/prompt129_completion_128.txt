  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, i++)
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, i++)
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `cb`.

DONE.
