  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```word.substr(1)```
This would result in different behavior because it would substrate the first character of the word, unlike the original code fragment which does not substrate anything and only returns the whole word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```rule[1].slice(1)```
This would result in different behavior because it would substrate the first character of the first element of the rule array, unlike the original code fragment which does not substrate anything and only returns the first element of the rule array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```word.substr(rule[1])```
This would result in different behavior because it would substrate the character at the index provided by the first element of the rule array, whereas the original code fragment does not substrate anything and only returns the whole word.

DONE.
