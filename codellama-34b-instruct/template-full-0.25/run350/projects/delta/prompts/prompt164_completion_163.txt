  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation is not handled in the original code, and the `retain` operation is not handled in the same way as the `delete` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operation is not handled in the original code, and the `insert` operation is not handled in the same way as the `delete` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' && thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operation is not handled in the original code, and the `retain` operation is not handled in the same way as the `delete` operation. Additionally, the `peekLength()` method is not used
