 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2) * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the constant multiplier for the `im` part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `re` part of the complex number as a multiplier for the `im` part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of `b` instead of `b` itself.

DONE.
