  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the data, while `null` would call the callback function with `null` instead of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the data, while `undefined` would call the callback function with `undefined` instead of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the data, while `0` would call the callback function with `0` instead of the data.

DONE.
