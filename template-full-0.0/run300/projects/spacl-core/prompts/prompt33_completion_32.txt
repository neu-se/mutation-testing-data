  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last part of the path, rather than all parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second-to-last part of the path, rather than all parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[2];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third-to-last part of the path, rather than all parts.

DONE.
