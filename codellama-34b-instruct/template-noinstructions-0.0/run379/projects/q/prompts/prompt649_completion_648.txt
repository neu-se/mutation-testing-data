  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array would be reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument would be added to the end of the array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be duplicated, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

DONE.
