  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `concat` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the last element removed, which would cause the `concat` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.ops.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the last element removed, which would cause the `concat` method to return a different result.

DONE.
