  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseInverted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the base object instead of the attribute object, which would lead to incorrect results in the `invert` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the base object using the `invert` function, which would lead to incorrect results in the `invert` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the base object using the `invert` function, which would lead to incorrect results in the `invert` function.

DONE.
