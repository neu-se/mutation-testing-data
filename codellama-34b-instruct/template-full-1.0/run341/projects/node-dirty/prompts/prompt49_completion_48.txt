  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called on `null`, which would throw a `TypeError` instead of calling the function and persisting the data to the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called on `undefined`, which would result in the data being stored as `undefined` instead of persisting the original data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Function("return 'foobar';")()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with a new function that returns the string `"foobar"` instead of the original function, which would result in the data being stored as the string `"foobar"` instead of persisting the original data.

DONE.
