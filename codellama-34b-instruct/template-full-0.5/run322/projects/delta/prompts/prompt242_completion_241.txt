  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but adding 1 would return the length of the current operation, which could be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next operation in the iterator, and the `length` property of the operation returns its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which could be different from the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator.

DONE.
