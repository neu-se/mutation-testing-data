  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a private property and is not defined in the class, so it would throw an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the key directly, without going through the `.get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `.get` method on the `_data` object, but with a different key than the one passed to the `get` method.

DONE.
