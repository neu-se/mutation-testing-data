 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the real part of the complex number, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the imaginary part of the current complex number as the real part of the result, which is not the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number as the real part of the complex number, instead of the actual value.

DONE.
