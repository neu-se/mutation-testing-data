Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.max` would always return the larger of the two values, potentially allowing the index to increase even when it should decrease, leading to incorrect position calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length would incorrectly increase the index adjustment, causing the index to move further than intended, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting 1 from the length would cause the index to decrease less than it should, potentially skipping over necessary deletions and resulting in incorrect position tracking.

DONE.
