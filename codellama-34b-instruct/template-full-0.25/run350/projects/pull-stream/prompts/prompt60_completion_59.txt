  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort()` is a function call, which would execute the `abort` function and potentially modify the state of the `sink` object. In contrast, `sink.abort` is a reference to the `abort` function itself, and does not execute it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it overrides the `abort` function with a new function that does nothing. In contrast, the original code fragment references the `abort` function as it was defined in the `sink` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `abort` property of the `sink` object to `null`, which would cause any subsequent calls to `sink.abort` to
