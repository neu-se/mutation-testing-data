  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `b = -1`
This would result in different behavior because `b` is being reassigned a value, which could affect the code that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `b + 1 === -1`
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional to check if `b + 1` is equal to `-1`, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `b === -2`
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is equal to `-2`, which could result in a different outcome.

DONE.
