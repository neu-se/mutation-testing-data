  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.values()` would return an Iterator object containing the values in the Map, but it would not provide the keys for each value, which would cause the `forEach` method to become broken.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.entries()` would return an Iterator object containing the key-value pairs in the Map, but it would not provide the keys for each value, which would cause the `forEach` method to become broken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.forEach((key, value) => this.set(key, value, () => console.log(key + ': ' + value)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would be called with a different function as the first argument, which would cause a different behavior when iterating over
