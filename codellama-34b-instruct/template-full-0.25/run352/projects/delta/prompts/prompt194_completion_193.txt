  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the condition, so the loop would continue even if there are no more elements in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if there are any more elements in the iterator, rather than checking if the current element is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() && otherIter.peek() != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if there are any more elements in the iterator and if the current element is not null, rather than just checking if there are any more elements in the iterator.

DONE.
