  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined" && MessageChannel.toString().indexOf("[native code]") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `MessageChannel` constructor is not a native code, which would make the `requestTick` function fall back to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined" && MessageChannel.toString().indexOf("[object MessageChannel]") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `MessageChannel` constructor is not an object, which would make the `requestTick` function fall back to the `setTimeout` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined" && MessageChannel.toString().indexOf("MessageChannel") === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `MessageChannel` constructor does not contain the string "MessageChannel", which would make the `request
