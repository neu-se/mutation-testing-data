  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the array at index `i` instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the array instead of the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements of the original array from index `i` to the end, instead of the original array itself.

DONE.
