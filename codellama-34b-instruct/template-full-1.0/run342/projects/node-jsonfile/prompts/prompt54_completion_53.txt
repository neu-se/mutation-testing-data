  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `spaces` property in the `obj` parameter, while this code would always return `1` as the value for `spaces`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `spaces` property in the `obj` parameter, while this code would always return `" "` (a space character) as the value for `spaces`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `spaces` property in the `obj` parameter, while this code would always return `null` as the value for `spaces`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
