  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" and "apply" are different methods of the Function prototype. "call" expects a context object as the first argument, while "apply" expects an array of arguments. Using "call" with an undefined context object would cause the function to be called with the global object as the context, which could result in unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are passed in the reverse order. This would cause the function to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which could result in unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" returns a new function that is bound to the specified context object, while "apply" and "call" call the function
