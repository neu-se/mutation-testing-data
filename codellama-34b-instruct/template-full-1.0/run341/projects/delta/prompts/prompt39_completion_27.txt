  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks whether the operands are not equal, while the `===` operator checks whether the operands are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks whether the operands are not identical, while the `===` operator checks whether the operands are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=== null` operator checks whether the operand is null, while the `===` operator checks whether the operand is equal to the variable.

DONE.
