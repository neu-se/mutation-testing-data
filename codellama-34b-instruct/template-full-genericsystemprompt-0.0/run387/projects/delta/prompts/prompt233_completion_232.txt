  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `otherIter` object instead of the `thisIter` object, which could lead to a different result in the `diffResult.forEach` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `thisIter` object instead of the `otherIter` object, which could lead to a different result in the `diffResult.forEach` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(length, thisIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `length` variable instead of the `otherIter.peekLength()` method, which could lead to a different result in the `diffResult.forEach` loop.
