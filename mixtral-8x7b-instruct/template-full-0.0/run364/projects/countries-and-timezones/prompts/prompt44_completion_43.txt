 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buildCountry(data, id).id
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the country's ID instead of the actual country object. This change would bypass the memoization logic and always create a new country object, even if it already exists in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `data` object, bypassing the `memoizeCountry` function. This change would prevent the country object from being stored in the `countries` object for future use, causing unnecessary API calls or data processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object instead of the actual country object. This change would break the functionality of any code that relies on the country object's properties, causing unexpected behavior or errors.
