  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator changes the sign of the value, which would affect the calculation of the `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator changes the value of `a`, which would affect the calculation of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2*` operator changes the value of `a`, which would affect the calculation of the `tan` function.

DONE.
