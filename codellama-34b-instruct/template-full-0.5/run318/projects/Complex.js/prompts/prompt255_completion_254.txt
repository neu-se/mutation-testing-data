  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `a`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not used in the original code fragment, so the function's behavior would be affected by the presence of this new code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c` variable is not used in the original code fragment, so the function's behavior would be affected by the presence of this new code.

DONE.
