  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called on the `defer` object, rather than the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called on the `promise` object, rather than the `defer` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called without an object context, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `reject` method is not properly bound.

DONE.
