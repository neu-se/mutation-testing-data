  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called and the `promise` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called and the `promise` variable is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"defer"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called and the `promise` variable is not defined.

DONE.
