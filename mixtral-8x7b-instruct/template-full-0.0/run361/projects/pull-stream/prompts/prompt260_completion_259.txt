 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the input as an error, instead of checking if the error is equal to `true`. This is different from the original code, which checks if the error is equal to `true` before deciding whether to continue streaming or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the input as a successful read, even if an error is passed. This is different from the original code, which checks if the error is equal to `true` before deciding whether to continue streaming or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the input as an error, regardless of the actual value of the error. This is different from the original code, which checks if the error is equal to `true` before deciding whether to continue streaming or not.

DONE.
