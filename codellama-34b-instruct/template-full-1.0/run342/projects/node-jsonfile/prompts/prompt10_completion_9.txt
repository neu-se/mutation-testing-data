  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a null check for the reviver function, while this new code does not. If the reviver function is not provided, the original code would pass null as the reviver function, while this new code would pass undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || (() => null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use a default value for the reviver function, while this new code uses a function that always returns null. If the reviver function is not provided, the original code would throw an error, while this new code would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || (data => data))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use a
