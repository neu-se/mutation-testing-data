Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` is not a valid method; it will throw an error, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` correctly returns a new array starting from the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` only returns the first argument instead of all arguments starting from the second one, which changes the intended functionality of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.concat()` will not work as expected; it will attempt to concatenate an empty array to `arguments`, resulting in an incorrect output instead of slicing the arguments array.

DONE.
