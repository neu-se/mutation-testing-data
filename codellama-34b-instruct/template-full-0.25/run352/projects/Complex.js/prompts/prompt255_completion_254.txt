  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / d
```
This would result in different behavior because `d` is a different variable than `b`.

DONE.
