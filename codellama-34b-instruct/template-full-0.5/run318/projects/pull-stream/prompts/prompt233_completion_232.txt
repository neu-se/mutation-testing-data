  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `test`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `test` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates to `false` if either operand is falsy, and `test` is truthy. Therefore, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `test` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates to `true` if either operand is truthy, and `test` is truthy. Therefore, the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `test` is falsy.

DONE.
