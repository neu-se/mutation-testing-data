  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would invert the value of `Δλ`, causing the calculation of `θ` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 180` would shift the value of `θ` by 180 degrees, causing the calculation of `θ` to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `Δλ`, causing the calculation of `θ` to be incorrect.

DONE.
