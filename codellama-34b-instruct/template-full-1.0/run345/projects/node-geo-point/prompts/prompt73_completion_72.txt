  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be doubled, leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be reduced by 1, leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random value would be used instead of the actual distance, leading to unpredictable and incorrect results.

DONE.
