Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next index in the array instead of the current index, potentially leading to undefined values being processed if the current index is the last one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value retrieved from the array by adding 1 to it, which changes the input to the callback function and could lead to incorrect results during the reduction process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value retrieved from the array by 2 before passing it to the callback function, altering the intended logic of the reduction operation.

DONE.
