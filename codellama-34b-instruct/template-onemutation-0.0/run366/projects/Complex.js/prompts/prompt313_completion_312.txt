  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are different functions, and the code is using the result of `cosh` to calculate the tangent. Replacing `cosh` with `sinh` would cause the code to calculate the sine instead of the cosine, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
