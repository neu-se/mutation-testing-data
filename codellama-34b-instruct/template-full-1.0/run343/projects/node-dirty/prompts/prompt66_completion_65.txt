  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `destroy()` method on the `this._writeStream` object, which would have closed the write stream and caused any subsequent writes to fail. The modified code fragment with `this._writeStream.destroy` would instead call the `destroy()` method and then the `end()` method on the `this._writeStream` object, which would cause the write stream to close and then attempt to write to the stream, resulting in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `destroy()` method on the `this._writeStream` object, which would have closed the write stream and caused any subsequent writes to fail. The modified code fragment with `this._writeStream.close` would instead call the `close()` method on the `this._writeStream` object, which would cause the write stream to close but would not attempt to write to the
