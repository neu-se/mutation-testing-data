  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].bind(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would change the behavior of the `generator[verb]` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].call(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the context of the function call, which would affect the behavior of the `generator[verb]` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].apply(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the context of the function call, which would affect the behavior of the `generator[verb]` call.

DONE.
