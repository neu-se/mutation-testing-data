  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating the elements of two or more arrays, and it takes no arguments. In the original code, the `next` variable is an array, and the `.concat` method is called on it without any arguments, which will simply return a copy of the `next` array. However, in the mutated code, the `.concat` method is called with no arguments, which will result in a TypeError because the `next` variable is an array and does not have a `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that creates a new array by selecting a subsection of an existing array, and it takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index. In the original code, the `next` variable is an array, and the `.slice` method is called on it with no arguments,
