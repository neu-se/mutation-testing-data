  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, rather than the `Q` object, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function, not an object, and does not have a `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q().dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q()` creates a new promise, which does not have a `dispatch` method.

DONE.
