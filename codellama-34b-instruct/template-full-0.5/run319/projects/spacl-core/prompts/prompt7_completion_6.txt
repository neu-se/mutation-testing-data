  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//g) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag causes the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash (`\`) escapes the forward slash (`/`) in the regular expression, causing it to match a literal backslash followed by a forward slash, rather than just a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor causes the regular expression to match only if the pattern is found at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
