  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end && thisIter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire `thisIter` iterator, even if it has already reached the `end` index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end && otherIter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire `otherIter` iterator, even if it has already reached the `end` index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire `iter` iterator, even if it has already reached the `end` index.

DONE.
