  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

DONE.
