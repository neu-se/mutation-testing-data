  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest));
```
This would result in different behavior because `pipe` returns a stream, but `createWriteStream` returns a writable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(dest));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream` is a method call, but `createWriteStream` is a variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(dest);
```
This would result in different behavior because `dest` is a string, but `createWriteStream` expects a writable stream.

DONE.
