  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `values` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(object).length` returns the number of keys in the object, whereas `values` returns an array of the values in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(object)` returns an array of key-value pairs in the object, whereas `values` returns an array of the values in the object.

DONE.
