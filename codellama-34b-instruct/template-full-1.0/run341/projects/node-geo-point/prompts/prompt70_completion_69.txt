  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo 360 operation would not be performed, leading to a different final value for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 360 would wrap the value of theta to a negative value, leading to a different final value for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 180 would wrap the value of theta to the opposite side of the range, leading to a different final value for the bearing.

DONE.
