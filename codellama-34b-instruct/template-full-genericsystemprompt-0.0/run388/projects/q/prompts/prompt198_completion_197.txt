  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is falsy, rather than checking if the entire array is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is falsy, rather than checking if the array itself is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.includes(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array includes the value `null`, rather than checking if the array itself is falsy.

DONE.
