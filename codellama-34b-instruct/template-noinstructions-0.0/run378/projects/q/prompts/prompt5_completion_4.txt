  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a new function that does nothing, rather than the original function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, rather than returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() { return "hello"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the string "hello", rather than a promise.

DONE.
