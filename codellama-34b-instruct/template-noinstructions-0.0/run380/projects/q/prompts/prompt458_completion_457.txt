  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value, but it would not propagate the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {}, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value, but it would also catch any rejections and convert them to fulfillments with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {}, function (reason) { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the original promise's fulfillment value, but it would also catch any rejections and convert them to fulfillments with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
