  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, and `s + 1` would result in a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, and `s.length` would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `s` is a function, and `s.source` would result in a different function.

DONE.
