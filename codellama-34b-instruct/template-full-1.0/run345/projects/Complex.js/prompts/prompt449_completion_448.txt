  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an additional operation, `Math.pow()`, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * (places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a different type of operation, multiplication by a non-constant, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a different constant, `10`, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
