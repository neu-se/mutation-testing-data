  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `embedType` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues if the `embedType` string is used in a case-sensitive context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `embedType` string to uppercase, which could potentially cause issues if the `embedType` string is used in a case-sensitive context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt()` method would return the first character of the `embedType` string, which could potentially cause issues if the `embedType` string is used in a context where the entire string is expected.

DONE.
