  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `a` would change the sign of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `1` would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `a` and `b` would change the result.

DONE.
