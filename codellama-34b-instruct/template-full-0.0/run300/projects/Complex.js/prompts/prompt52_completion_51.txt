  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is a different property than `a['arg']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg'] + 1` is a different calculation than `a['arg']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg'] * 2` is a different calculation than `a['arg']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

DONE.
