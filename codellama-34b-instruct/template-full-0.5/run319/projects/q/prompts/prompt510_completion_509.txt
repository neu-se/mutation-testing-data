  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is undefined, which would cause the `apply` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is null, which would cause the `apply` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is an empty array, which would cause the `apply` method to fail.

DONE.
