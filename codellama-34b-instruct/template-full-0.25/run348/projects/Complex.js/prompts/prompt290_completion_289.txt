  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the value, which could affect the calculation of the complex number's magnitude and angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value of `b` could change the calculation of the complex number's magnitude and angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `b` by 2 could change the calculation of the complex number's magnitude and angle.

DONE.
