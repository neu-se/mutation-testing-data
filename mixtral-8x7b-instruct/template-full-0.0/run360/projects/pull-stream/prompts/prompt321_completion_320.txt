 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to the callback function, which could cause issues if the order is important in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of arguments passed to the callback function, which could cause issues if the number of arguments is being checked in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the same value twice as arguments to the callback function, which could cause issues if the test suite is checking for unique values or if the order of the arguments is important.

DONE.
