  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `makeNodeResolver` function, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number of arguments to the `makeNodeResolver` function, whereas the original code passes the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first one to the `makeNodeResolver` function, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

DONE.
