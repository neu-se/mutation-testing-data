  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the complex number representation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the complex number representation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would always return 0, which would cause the complex number representation to be incorrect.

DONE.
