  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object instead of the `Promise` object, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `Q` object has a different implementation of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
