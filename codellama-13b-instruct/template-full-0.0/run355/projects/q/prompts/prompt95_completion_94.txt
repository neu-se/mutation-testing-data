  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run for one more iteration than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run for one less iteration than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run if the index is equal to the length of the array, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
