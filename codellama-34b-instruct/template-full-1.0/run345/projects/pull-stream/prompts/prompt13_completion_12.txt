  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will never terminate, as `i` will always be incremented by 1 and never reach its upper bound.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will terminate 1 iteration earlier than the original loop, as `i` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will terminate 2 iterations earlier than the original loop, as `i` will be decremented by 2 after each iteration.

DONE.
