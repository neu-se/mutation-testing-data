 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `href` to a relative path, which might not be correctly parsed by the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `href` to `null`, which would cause the `parse` function to return `null` as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `href` to a boolean value, which is not a valid URL and would cause the `parse` function to return `null`.

DONE.
