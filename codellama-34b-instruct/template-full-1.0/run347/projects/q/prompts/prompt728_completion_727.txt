  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `reject` on the `deferred` object would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `notify` on the `deferred` object would trigger the progress notification, rather than resolving the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `then` on the promise returned by `deferred` would create a new promise that would be resolved with the value returned by the callback passed to `then`, rather than being resolved with the value returned by the original function.

DONE.
