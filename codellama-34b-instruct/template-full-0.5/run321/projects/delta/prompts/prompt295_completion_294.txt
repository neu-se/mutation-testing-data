  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas `next` returns the next operation and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` with an argument advances the iterator by that many operations, whereas `peek` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` with an argument advances the iterator by that many operations, whereas `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
