  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is null, but this code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is null, but this code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `firstOther.attributes` is null, but this code fragment
