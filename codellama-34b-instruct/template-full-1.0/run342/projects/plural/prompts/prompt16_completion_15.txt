  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.length - 1` to count the length of the word without the ending 'y'. Replacing it with `w.length` would count the entire word and could result in a different character position being selected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be equivalent to using `w.length - 1` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select a different character position in the word.

DONE.
