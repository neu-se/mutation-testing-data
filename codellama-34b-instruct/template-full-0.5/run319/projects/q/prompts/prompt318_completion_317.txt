  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is the root of the prototype chain for all objects in JavaScript, whereas `Promise.prototype` is a specific object that is used as the prototype for promise instances. Using `Object.prototype` would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method. Calling `promiseDispatch` on `null` would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object that does not have a `promiseDispatch` method. Calling `promiseDispatch` on an empty object would likely result in an error.

DONE.
