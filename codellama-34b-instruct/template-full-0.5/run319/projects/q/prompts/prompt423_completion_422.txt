  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `object` instead of the `promise` object, which would cause the `state` property to be undefined and the `then` method to be called on a non-promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `object` instead of the `promise` object, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a non-promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is called on the `promise` object instead of the `object` object, which would cause the `state` property to be defined and the `then` method to be called on a promise object.

DONE.
