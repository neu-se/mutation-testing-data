  Here are three options to replace the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for every `linkurl`, which is not intended and may cause a logic error in `gettype()` when it needs to determine if `linkurl` is a sublevel of `pageurl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path === pageurl.path 
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `pageurl` and `linkurl` have the same path name, which is not likely to be the case in most scenarios. This would cause `gettype()` to always return "samelevel" when the actual relationship between `pageurl` and `linkurl` could be more nuanced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length <
