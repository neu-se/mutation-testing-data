 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes only two arguments to the callback, while the modified one passes three arguments. This could cause issues if the test suite expects the callback to have only two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(test(data))
