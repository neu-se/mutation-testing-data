  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN or not, while the `!isNaN` is the opposite, it checks if a value is not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is NaN or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a static method of the Number object and checks if a value is NaN or not, the `isNaN` function is a global function that can be called as a method of the Number object.

DONE.
