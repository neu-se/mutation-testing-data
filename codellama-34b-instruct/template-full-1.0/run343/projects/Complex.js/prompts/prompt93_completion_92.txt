  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is no longer checking for equality, but instead is checking for truthiness. This change would cause the conditional to evaluate to `true` if `plus + minus` is equal to `0`, and `c` is not `NaN`, rather than when `plus + minus` is equal to `0` or `c` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is no longer checking for inequality, but instead is checking for falsiness. This change would cause the conditional to evaluate to `false` if `plus + minus` is not equal to `0`, or `c` is not `NaN`, rather than when `plus + minus` is not equal to `0` or `c` is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
