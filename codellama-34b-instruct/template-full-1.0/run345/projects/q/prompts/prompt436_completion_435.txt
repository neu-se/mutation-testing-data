  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array, while `includes()` returns a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `>= 0` would ensure that the element is present in the array, while `array_indexOf()` only checks if the element is not present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` would check if the element is present in the array, and `&& false` would ensure that the returned value is always false, even if the element is present in the array.

DONE.
