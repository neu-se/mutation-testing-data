  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the file extension of the destination path, regardless of whether the destination path is a file or a directory. In the original code, the `path.extname()` method is only called if the `extractFilename` option is set to `true`, and it is used to extract the file name from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the directory name of the destination path, regardless of whether the destination path is a file or a directory. In the original code, the `path.dirname()` method is only called if the `extractFilename` option is set to `true`, and it is used to extract the directory name from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because
