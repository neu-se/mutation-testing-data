  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the added code fragment would add an "es" to the end of words that end in "ics", which is not the intended behavior for words that end in "ics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the added code fragment would add an "s" to the end of words that end in "ics", which is not the intended behavior for words that end in "ics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the added code fragment would remove the last two characters of words that end in "ics" and add an "i" to
