  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
