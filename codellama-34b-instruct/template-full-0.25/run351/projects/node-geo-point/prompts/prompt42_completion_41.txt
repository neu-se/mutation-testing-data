  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the product of the two radian values, which would produce a different result than the original code that calculates the sine of the sum of the two radian values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the first radian value multiplied by the sine of the second radian value, which would produce a different result than the original code that calculates the sine of the sum of the two radian values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the first radian value multiplied by the cosine of the second radian value, which would produce a
