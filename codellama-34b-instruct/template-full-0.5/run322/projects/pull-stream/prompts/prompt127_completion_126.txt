  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would increment `i` by 1 instead of returning its current value, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would multiply `i` by 2 instead of returning its current value, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
