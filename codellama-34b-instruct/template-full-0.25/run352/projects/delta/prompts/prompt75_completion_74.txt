  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` only performs a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` performs a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(obj, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `cloneDeep` is a boolean that indicates whether to clone the object's prototype chain as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(obj, (key, value) => value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `cloneDeep` is a function that is called for each property of the object, and the function should return the new value for that property.

DONE.
