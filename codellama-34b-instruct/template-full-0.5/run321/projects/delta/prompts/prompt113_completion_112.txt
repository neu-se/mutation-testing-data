  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of elements in the `ops` array, rather than the sum of the lengths of the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of elements in the `ops` array minus one, rather than the sum of the lengths of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return twice the number of elements in the `ops` array, rather than the sum of the lengths of the elements.

DONE.
