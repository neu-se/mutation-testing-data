Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === undefined || point.coordinates === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `undefined` instead of using `hasOwnProperty`, which may not catch cases where the properties exist but are set to `null` or other falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.type && !point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses logical AND instead of OR, meaning it would only throw an error if both properties are falsy, which is not the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for the type being 'Point' and the length of coordinates, which would allow objects that do not have the correct structure to pass through if they have the correct type.

DONE.
