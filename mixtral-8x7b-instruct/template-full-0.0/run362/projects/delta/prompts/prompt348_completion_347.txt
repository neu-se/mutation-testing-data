 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return an incomplete `Delta` object, as the `handler.invert` function would not receive the required arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[opData, baseOpData]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a `Delta` object with an incorrectly inverted operation. Instead of inverting the attributes, it would push a new array containing both `opData` and `baseOpData` into the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
opData + baseOpData
