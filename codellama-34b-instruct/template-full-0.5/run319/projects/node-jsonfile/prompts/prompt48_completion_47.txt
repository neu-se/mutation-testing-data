  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the original code fragment `str` is a truthy value. In the `writeFileSync` function, the `fs.writeFileSync` method is called with `str` as the third argument. If `str` is replaced with `null`, the method will not be called with the expected arguments, and the behavior of the function will change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the original code fragment `str` is a truthy value. In the `writeFileSync` function, the `fs.writeFileSync` method is called with `str` as the third argument. If `str` is replaced with `undefined`, the method will not be called with the expected arguments, and the behavior of the function will change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
