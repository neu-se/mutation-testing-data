  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "a" is not a valid line number, and would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined`, which would then cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false`, even if the input string matches the expected format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid line number, and would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined`, which would then cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false`, even if the input string matches the expected format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid line number, and would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined`, which would then cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false`, even if the input string
