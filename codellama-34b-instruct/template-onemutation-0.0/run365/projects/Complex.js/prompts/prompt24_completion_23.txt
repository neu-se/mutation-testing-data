  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` is the cube root function, whereas `Math.sqrt` is the square root function. The `hypot` function uses the square root function to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so replacing it with the cube root function would produce incorrect results.
