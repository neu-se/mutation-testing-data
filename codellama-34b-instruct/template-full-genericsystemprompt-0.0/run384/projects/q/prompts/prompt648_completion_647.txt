  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array with an extra element added to the end, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would return a new array with the elements in reverse order, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
