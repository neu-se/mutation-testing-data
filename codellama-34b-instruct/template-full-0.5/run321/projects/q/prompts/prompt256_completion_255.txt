  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as `resolvedPromise` is a promise object and not a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, as `resolvedPromise` is a promise object and not a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as `resolvedPromise` is a promise object and not a boolean value.

DONE.
