  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games).concat(illnesses).concat(misc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the arrays in a different order, potentially changing the resulting plural form of some words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games).concat(illnesses).concat(misc).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the arrays in a different order and then reverse the resulting array, potentially changing the resulting plural form of some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.concat(illnesses).concat(games).concat(clothes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the arrays in a different order, potentially changing the resulting plural form of some words.

DONE.
