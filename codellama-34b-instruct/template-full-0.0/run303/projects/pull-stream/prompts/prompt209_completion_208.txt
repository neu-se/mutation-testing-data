  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the code to execute the `cb(aborted)` line even if `aborted` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `aborted` and `err` are truthy, causing the code to execute the `cb(aborted)` line only if both conditions are met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `err` or `aborted` is truthy, causing the code to execute the `cb(aborted)` line if either condition is met.

DONE.
