  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.try` would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.try` would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"q"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.try` would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` when trying to access the `dispatch` method of the string `"q"`.

DONE.
