Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `hasOwnProperty` method directly on the `obj` object, which may not exist or may be overridden, whereas the original code uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` to ensure the method is called with the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key is present in the object's prototype chain, whereas the original code only checks if the key is the object's own property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `true`, effectively including all properties in the `sortedKeys` array, regardless of whether they are the object's own properties or not, which could lead to incorrect results if the object has inherited properties that should be excluded.

DONE.
