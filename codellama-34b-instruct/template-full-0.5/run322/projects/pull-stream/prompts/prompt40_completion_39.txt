  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `read` to be a function, but `null` is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `read` to be a function, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `read` to be a function, but the new function would not have the same behavior as the original `read` function.

DONE.
