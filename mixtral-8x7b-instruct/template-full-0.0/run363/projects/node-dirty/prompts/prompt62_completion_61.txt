 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the 'ENOENT' error code, and instead emit an error for any 'error' event on the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not destroy the read stream, potentially causing resource leaks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream(this.path, {flags: 'w'});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the file instead of appending to it, causing data loss.

DONE.
