Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of the complex number when the imaginary part is non-zero, which is not the intended behavior of returning the square root when the imaginary part is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly trigger the calculation for the square root when the real part is negative, potentially leading to incorrect results for complex numbers that should return a positive real square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the square root when both the real and imaginary parts are zero, ignoring the case where the imaginary part is zero and the real part is positive, which should also return a valid square root.

DONE.
