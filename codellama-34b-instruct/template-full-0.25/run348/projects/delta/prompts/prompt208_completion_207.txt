  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is a `Delta` instance. The `chop` method removes the last operation from the delta if it is a no-op (i.e., if it does not change the document). In contrast, the code fragment in option 1 would attempt to call the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is not a function and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(new Delta())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `concat` method on the `delta` object, which is a `Delta` instance. The `concat` method concatenates the operations of the `delta` object with the operations of another `Delta` instance. In contrast, the code fragment in option 2 would attempt to call the `concat` method on the `delta` object with a new `
