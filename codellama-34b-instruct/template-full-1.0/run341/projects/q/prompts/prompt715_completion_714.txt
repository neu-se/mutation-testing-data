  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would not be a valid object reference, and would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior when the dispatch method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `value` property of the `object` object, which may not exist or may not contain the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `name` property of the `object` object, which may not exist or may not contain the expected value.

DONE.
