  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an exception, whereas the original code would have evaluated to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.props.arg;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `arg` property of the `this` object, whereas the original code would have accessed the `arg` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window.exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `exception` variable in the global scope, whereas the original code would have accessed the locally defined `exception` variable.

DONE.
