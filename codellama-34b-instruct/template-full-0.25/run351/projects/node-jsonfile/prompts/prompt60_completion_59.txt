  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment checks if the length of `content` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString() !== '[object Buffer]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment checks if the string representation of `content` is not equal to the string `'[object Buffer]'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `content` is a buffer, while this new code fragment checks if `content` is not a buffer.

DONE.
