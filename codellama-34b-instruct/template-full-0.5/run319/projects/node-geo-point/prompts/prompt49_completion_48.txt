  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being used in the calculation, but the longitude value is being used instead. This would cause the calculation to produce an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being used in the calculation, but the latitude value of the first point is being used instead. This would cause the calculation to produce an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being used in the calculation, but the longitude value of the first point is being used instead. This would cause the calculation to produce an incorrect result.

DONE.
