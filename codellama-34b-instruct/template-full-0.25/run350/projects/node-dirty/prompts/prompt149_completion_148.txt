  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the callbacks would be called in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array without the first element, so the callbacks would be called for all but the first element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, so the callbacks would be called only for the elements that have a length greater than 0.

DONE.
