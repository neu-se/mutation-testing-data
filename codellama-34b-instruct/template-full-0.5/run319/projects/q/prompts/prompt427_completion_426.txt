  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise or a promise-like object, whereas `isPromise` only checks if an object is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise(object)` checks if an object is not a promise, whereas `isPromise(object)` checks if an object is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled(object)` checks if an object is a fulfilled promise, whereas `isPromise(object)` only checks if an object is a promise.

DONE.
