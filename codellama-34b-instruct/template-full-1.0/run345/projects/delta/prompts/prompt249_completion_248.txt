  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp.delete == null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `otherOp.delete` is null, not if it is undefined or has a falsey value. If `otherOp.delete` is undefined or has a falsey value, the code would still execute the logic inside the if statement, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `otherOp` is truthy, but does not check if it has a `.delete` property or if the value of `.delete` is null or undefined. If `otherOp` is truthy but does not have a `.delete` property or if the value of `.delete` is null or undefined, the code would still execute the logic inside the if statement, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option
