  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called with the expected `exception` argument, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called with the expected `exception` argument, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with a different error object, which could lead to different handling of the error in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
