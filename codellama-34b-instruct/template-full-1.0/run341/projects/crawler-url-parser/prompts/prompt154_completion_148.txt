  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(.*?)[\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching any character, rather than just non-slash characters, and the "*" operator is now non-greedy, so it will match the shortest possible string rather than the longest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag is added, which will perform a global match, rather than just finding the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching any character that is not a slash, rather than just non-slash characters.

DONE.
