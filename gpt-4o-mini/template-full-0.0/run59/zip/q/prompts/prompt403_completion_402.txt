Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw new Error("Rejected"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it always throws a new error with a fixed message instead of rejecting with the provided reason, which could lead to loss of context about the original rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject("Default rejection reason");
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects with a static string "Default rejection reason" regardless of the actual reason provided, which could mislead users about the nature of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return "Not rejected"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves with a string "Not rejected" instead of rejecting, which would change the promise's state from rejected to fulfilled, thus altering the expected flow of error handling.

DONE.
