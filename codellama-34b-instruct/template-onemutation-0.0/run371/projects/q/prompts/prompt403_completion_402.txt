  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that rejects a promise with a given reason. Using `thenResolve` instead of `thenReject` would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value, rather than rejected with the given reason.

DONE.
