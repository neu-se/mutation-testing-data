  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` function would return 0, which would cause the `retain` operation to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` function would return 1, which would cause the `retain` operation to retain only the first character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` function would return -1, which would cause the `retain` operation to retain the entire string, including the null character at the end.

DONE.
