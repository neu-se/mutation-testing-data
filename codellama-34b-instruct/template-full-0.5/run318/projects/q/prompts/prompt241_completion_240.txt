  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function checks if the argument is a promise, and replacing it with its negation would cause the code to behave differently for non-promise values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if the argument is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than `isPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseLike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseLike` is a different function that checks if the argument is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than `isPromise`.

DONE.
