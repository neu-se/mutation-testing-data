  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Map.prototype.set()` to set the value for the given key, while this replacement code uses `Map.prototype.set()` to set the value for a different key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Map.prototype.set()` to set the value for the given key, while this replacement code uses `Map.prototype.set()` to set the value for the same key, but with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Map.prototype.set()` to set the value for the given key, while this replacement code uses `Map.prototype.set()` to set
