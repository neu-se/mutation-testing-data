  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `untrackRejection()` method to remove elements from the copy instead of the original array, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of another array, which would cause the `untrackRejection()` method to remove elements from the concatenated array instead of the original array, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes elements from an array, which would cause the `untrackRejection()` method to remove elements from the array instead of the original array, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
