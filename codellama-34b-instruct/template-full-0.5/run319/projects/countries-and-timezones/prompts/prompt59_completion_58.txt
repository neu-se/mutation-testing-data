  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, "invalid_id")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive an invalid country ID, which would cause it to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a country ID that is one more than the original ID, which would cause it to return a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would receive a country ID that is twice the original ID, which would cause it to return a different country object.

DONE.
