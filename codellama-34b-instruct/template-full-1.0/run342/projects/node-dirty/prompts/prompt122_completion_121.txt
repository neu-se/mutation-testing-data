  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'drain' is emitted when the queue is empty and all writes have been completed, but the event 'error' is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'drain' is emitted when the queue is empty and all writes have been completed, but the event 'read_close' is emitted when the read stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event 'drain' is emitted when the queue is empty and all writes have been completed, but the event 'write_close' is emitted when the write stream is closed.

DONE.
