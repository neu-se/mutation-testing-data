  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and return `new Complex(0, Infinity)`. Replacing it with `0` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and return `new Complex(Math.atan2(0, a), 0)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and return `new Complex(0, Infinity)`. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and return `new Complex(Math.atan2(-1, a), 0)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause
