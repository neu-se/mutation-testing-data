  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same words as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different, and it would not produce the same output as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' })
```
This would result in
