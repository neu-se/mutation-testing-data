  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false !== op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is negating the result of `op(data)`, which was previously negating the value of `op` and `false` together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false && op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is now checking the value of `op(data)` after checking the value of `op` and `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && (false !== op(data)) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses around `(false !== op(data))` are now causing the `!==` operator to be evaluated before the `&&` operator.

DONE.
