  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dis
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a syntax error, as `dis` would be considered a variable and not a method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.posts
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `posts` method on the current object, which may not exist or may not have the same effect as the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dis
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dis` method on the `Q` object, which may not exist or may not have the same effect as the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
