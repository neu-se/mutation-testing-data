  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete && newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `lastOp.delete` is truthy, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete > newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `lastOp.delete` is greater than `newOp.insert`, regardless of their types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete < newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `lastOp.delete` is less than `newOp.insert`, regardless of their types.

DONE.
