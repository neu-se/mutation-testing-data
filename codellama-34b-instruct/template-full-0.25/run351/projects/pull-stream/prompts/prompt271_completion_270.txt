  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` is a method that returns an array of values in the stream, whereas `values` is a function that returns a new stream with the same values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.map` applies a function to each value in the stream, whereas `values` simply returns the values in the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(function(x) { return x > 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.filter` returns a new stream with only the values that pass the filter function, whereas `values` returns all the values in the stream.

DONE.
