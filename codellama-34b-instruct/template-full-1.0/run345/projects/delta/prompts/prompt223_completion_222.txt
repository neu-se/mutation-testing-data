  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `strings[0]` refers to the string "Hello World", whereas `strings[1]` refers to the string "Goodbye World".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `strings[2]` refers to the string "Hello Again", whereas `strings[1]` refers to the string "Goodbye World".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `strings[3]` refers to the string "Goodbye Again", whereas `strings[1]` refers to the string "Goodbye World".

DONE.
