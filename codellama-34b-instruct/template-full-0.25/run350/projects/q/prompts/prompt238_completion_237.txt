  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue = <PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearerValue` variable to be assigned the value of `resolvedPromise`, rather than the value of `resolvedPromise.valueOf()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue = <PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise.valueOf());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearerValue` variable to be assigned the value of `resolvedPromise.valueOf()`, rather than the value of `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue = <PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearerValue` variable to be assigned the value of `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch`, rather than the value of `resolvedPromise`.
