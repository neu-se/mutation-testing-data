  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would now decrement the index instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would now skip every other index, potentially causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would now visit every other index, potentially causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
