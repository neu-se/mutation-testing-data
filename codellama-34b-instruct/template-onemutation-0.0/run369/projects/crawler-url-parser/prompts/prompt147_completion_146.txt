  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method with a single argument, which splits the string into an array of substrings using the specified separator. However, the new code fragment uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the string into an array of substrings using whitespace as the separator. This would cause the `linkurl_parts` variable to have a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the `gettype` function to return a different value.

DONE.
