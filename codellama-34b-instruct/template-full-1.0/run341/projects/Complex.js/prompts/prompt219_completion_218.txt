  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b*b` expression is always positive, whereas the original `b` expression could be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b+a` expression could be negative, whereas the original `b` expression is always positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b-a` expression could be negative, whereas the original `b` expression is always positive.

DONE.
