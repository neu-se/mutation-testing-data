Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it expects an additional column number in the stack trace format, which may cause it to fail to match valid stack lines that do not include a column number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+) \[(.+):(\d+)\]$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected format to include square brackets around the filename, which is not a standard format for stack traces and would lead to incorrect parsing of valid stack lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at (.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the column number entirely, which may lead to incorrect extraction of the filename and line number from stack traces that include column information, potentially causing errors in stack trace handling.

DONE.
