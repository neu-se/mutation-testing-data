  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with a protocol or a relative path, while this replacement only checks if it starts with "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with a protocol or a relative path, while this replacement checks if the string contains the substring "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/^(?!localhost)\w+:/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with a protocol or a relative path, while this replacement checks if the string starts with a non-localhost domain name followed by a colon.

DONE.
