  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a given angle, while `-Math.cos` returns the negative cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a given angle, while `1 / Math.cos` returns the inverse cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a given angle, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine.

DONE.
