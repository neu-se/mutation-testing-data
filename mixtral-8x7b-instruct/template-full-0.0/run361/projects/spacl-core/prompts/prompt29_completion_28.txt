 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('').replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the `parts` array into a string and then calls the `replace` method, instead of using the `reduce` method to concatenate the elements with a slash (`/`) separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.filter(x => x).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes any falsy values from the `parts` array before joining them with a slash (`/`) separator, instead of using the `reduce` method to concatenate the elements with a slash (`/`) separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element of the `parts` array before joining the remaining elements with a slash (`/`) separator, instead of using the
