  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `src` string into an array of substrings, and then iterates over the array using the `forEach` method to call the `glob` method on each substring. However, the buggy code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `src` string into an array of substrings, but then iterates over the array using the `forEach` method to call the `glob` method on the original `src` string, rather than each substring. This would cause the `glob` method to be called on the wrong input, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
