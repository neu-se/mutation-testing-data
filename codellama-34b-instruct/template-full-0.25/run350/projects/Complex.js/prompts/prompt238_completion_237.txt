  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and would not have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different value than `b`, and would affect the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `-b` is the negative of `b`, and would affect the calculation of the complex square root.

DONE.
