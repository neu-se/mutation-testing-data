  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['im'] === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this['im']` is equal to 0, but the new code fragment also checks if `this['isInfinite']()` is true. This means that the new code fragment will only return `Infinity` if the imaginary part of the complex number is 0 and the real part is infinite, whereas the original code fragment would return `Infinity` if the imaginary part is 0 regardless of the real part.
