  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This change will cause the `delete` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This change will cause the `delete` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This change will cause the `delete` method to always return `this`, regardless of the value of `length`.

DONE.
