  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length()` is a function, not a property, and thus would produce a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length(thisOp)` returns the number of operations in `thisOp`, which is different from the number of operations in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length(otherOp)` returns the number of operations in `otherOp`, which is different from the number of operations in the original code fragment.

DONE.
