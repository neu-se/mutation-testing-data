Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptions[key]!== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists and is not undefined, whereas the original code checks if the property exists as its own property, not inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptions.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the property exists as its own property, but does not check if it is inherited from the prototype chain, and also does not check if the property is enumerable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in descriptions
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists, either as its own property or inherited from the prototype chain, but does not check if the property is enumerable, and also does not distinguish between own and inherited properties.

DONE.
