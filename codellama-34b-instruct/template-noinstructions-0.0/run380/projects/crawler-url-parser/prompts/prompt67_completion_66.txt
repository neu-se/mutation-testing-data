  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"=="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, while the `=` operator is used for assignment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, while the `=` operator is used for assignment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<>` operator checks for inequality, while the `=` operator is used for assignment.

DONE.
