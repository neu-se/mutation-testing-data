  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 1 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a === 0` check would be bypassed, leading to a potential divide-by-zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would be replaced with `||`, leading to different branching behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a === 0` and `b === 0` checks would always be false, leading to a divide-by-zero error.

DONE.
