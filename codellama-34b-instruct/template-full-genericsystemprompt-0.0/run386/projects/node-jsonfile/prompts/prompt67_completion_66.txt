  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first occurrence of the newline character with a space, instead of the intended newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first occurrence of the newline character with a tab character, instead of the intended newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first occurrence of the newline character with an empty string, instead of the intended newline character.

DONE.
