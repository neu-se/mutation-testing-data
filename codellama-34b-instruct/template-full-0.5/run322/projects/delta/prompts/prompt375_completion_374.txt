  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next(null)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next(undefined)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
