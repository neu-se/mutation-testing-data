  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is an array of reasons, and `reason` is a single reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises, and `rejection` is a single promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is an array of promises that have been reported as unhandled, and `promise` is a single promise.

DONE.
