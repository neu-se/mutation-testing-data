  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `cb(true)`

This would result in different behavior because `cb(true)` would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `ended`. In contrast, the original code fragment `cb` would return the value of `ended`, which could be either `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `cb(null, data)`

This would result in different behavior because `cb(null, data)` would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `ended`. In contrast, the original code fragment `cb` would return either `null` or `ended`, depending on the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `cb(ended && !end)`

This would result in different behavior because `cb(ended && !end)` would return `ended` if `end` is `false`, regardless of the value of `ended`. In contrast, the original code fragment `cb` would return either `null` or `ended`, depending on the value of `ended`.
