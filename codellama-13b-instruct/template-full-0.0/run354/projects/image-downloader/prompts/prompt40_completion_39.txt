  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: '../' + dest }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `../` prefix would cause the file to be written to a parent directory, potentially overwriting existing files or creating a security vulnerability.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.txt` extension would cause the file to be written with a different file extension, potentially causing issues with file type detection or compatibility.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would cause the file name to be written in uppercase, potentially causing issues with case-sensitive file systems or compatibility with other systems that are case-sensitive.

DONE.
