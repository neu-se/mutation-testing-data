  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function is not called, so the callback would not be executed asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function is called with the `cb` function as an argument, but the `cb` function is not executed immediately. Instead, it is scheduled to be executed asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is called with a timeout of 0 milliseconds, which means that the `cb` function would be executed asynchronously after a very short delay.

DONE.
