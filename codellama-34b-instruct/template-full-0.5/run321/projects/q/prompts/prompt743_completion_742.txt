  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected with the rejection reason of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is fulfilled with the fulfillment value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is fulfilled or rejected based on the state of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

DONE.
