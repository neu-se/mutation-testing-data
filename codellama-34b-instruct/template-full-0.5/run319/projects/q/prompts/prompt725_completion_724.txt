  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` is not a function, and it will throw an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fulfillmentValue
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.fulfillmentValue` is not a function, and it will throw an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.rejectionReason
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.rejectionReason` is not a function, and it will throw an error when called.

DONE.
