  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `path` string to lowercase, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `path` string into an array of substrings using `/` as the separator, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy is based on the last element of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of `/` in the `path` string with an empty string, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect
