  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Complex('0.9999999999999999')```
This would result in a different answer because the original code produces a more accurate answer for large values of `a`. The buggy code fragment produces `0.9999999999999999`, which is not the correct result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Complex(0.1)```
This would result in a different answer because the original code produces a more accurate answer for small values of `a`. The buggy code fragment produces `0.1`, which is not the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Complex('0.000000010000001')```
This would result in a different answer because the original code produces a more accurate answer for large values of `a` and small values of `b`. The buggy code fragment produces `0.00
