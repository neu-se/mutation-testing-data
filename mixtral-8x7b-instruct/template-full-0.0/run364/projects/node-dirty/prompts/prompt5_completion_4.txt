 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.delete()` method would not remove the key-value pair if the value is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.set()` method would overwrite the existing value with the integer `1`, instead of storing the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `_data` map as an argument to the `cb` function, instead of just the value associated with the key.

DONE.
