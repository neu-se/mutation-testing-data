  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the file name and line number, rather than the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the file name and line number string, rather than the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the file name and line number string in uppercase, rather than the original case.

DONE.
