  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `ended` variable, causing the code to execute the callback even if `ended` is already true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to true every time the callback is called, regardless of its previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `ended` to false every time the callback is called, regardless of its previous value.

DONE.
