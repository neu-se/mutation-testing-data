  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to use the HTTPS protocol instead of the HTTP protocol, which could cause the URL to be invalid or to redirect to a different page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to use the FTP protocol instead of the HTTP protocol, which could cause the URL to be invalid or to redirect to a different page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to use the file protocol instead of the HTTP protocol, which could cause the URL to be invalid or to redirect to a different page.

DONE.
