  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `makeGenerator` function, while this modified code fragment passes the argument `1`. This could potentially change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `makeGenerator` function, while this modified code fragment passes the argument `null`. This could potentially change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `makeGenerator` function, while this modified code fragment passes the argument `undefined`. This could potentially change the behavior of the
