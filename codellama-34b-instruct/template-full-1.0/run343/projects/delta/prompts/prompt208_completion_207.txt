  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta * chop
```
This would result in different behavior because `chop` is a method that modifies the `delta` object and returns a new `Delta` object, but without `delta` it would be a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chop(delta)
```
This would result in different behavior because `chop` is a method that modifies the `delta` object and returns a new `Delta` object, but without `delta` it would be an unused function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const chop = delta * chop
```
This would result in different behavior because `chop` is a method that modifies the `delta` object and returns a new `Delta` object, but without `delta` it would be a constant that does not modify or return anything.

DONE.
