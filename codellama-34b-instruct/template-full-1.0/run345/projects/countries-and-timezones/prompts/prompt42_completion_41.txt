  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `getTimezone` function instead of the `getCountry` function, which would cause the returned object to have different properties and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: countries[id] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the country object directly from the `countries` object instead of calling the `getCountry` function, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `countries` object is modified or if the `getCountry` function has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `null` instead of the country object, which could cause the code to behave differently if it relies on the returned object being non-null.

DONE.
