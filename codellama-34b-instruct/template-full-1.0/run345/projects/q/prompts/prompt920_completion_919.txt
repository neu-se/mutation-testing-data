  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(42).fapply([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(42).fapply([])` would resolve to 42 immediately, while the original code would resolve to a promise that is rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(42).nfapply([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(42).nfapply([])` would resolve to 42 immediately, while the original code would resolve to a promise that is rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(42).delay(0).fapply([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(42).delay(0).fapply([])` would resolve to 42 after a delay of 0 milliseconds, while the original code would resolve to a promise that is rejected with an error.

DONE.
