 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options.dest` string is an empty string, instead of checking if it's an absolute path. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the `options.dest` string is not empty but not an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.win32.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options.dest` string is not an absolute path using the Windows-specific method, `path.win32.isAbsolute()`. This could lead to incorrect behavior when running the code on non-Windows systems.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fs.existsSync(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the file or directory specified by `options.dest` does not exist, instead of checking if the path is absolute. This could
