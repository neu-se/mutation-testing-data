 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of using the `URL.parse()` function, which would cause the `URL.format()` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `parsedBaseUrl` variable to `null` instead of using the `URL.parse()` function, which would cause the `URL.resolve()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a URL object with an empty string instead of using the `currentUrlStr` variable, which would cause the `URL.resolve()` function to return a different value.

DONE.
