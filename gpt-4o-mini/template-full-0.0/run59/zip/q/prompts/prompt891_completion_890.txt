Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfapply` function to not pass any arguments to the callback, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when the callback expects arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the arguments to the callback, which may not be what the callback function expects, leading to incorrect execution or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would be treated as a single argument, which could cause the callback to behave incorrectly if it does not handle `null` as a valid input.

DONE.
