  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Deferred` will create a new deferred object, whereas `defer` was used to create a new deferred object in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const deferred = Promise.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `const deferred = Promise.defer()` will create a new deferred object and assign it to the constant `deferred`, whereas `defer` was used to create a new deferred object in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `var deferred = Q.defer()` will create a new deferred object and assign it to the variable `deferred`, whereas `defer` was used to create a new deferred object in the original code.

DONE.
