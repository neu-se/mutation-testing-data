Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `promise` variable instead of the `rejection` variable, which means the rejection tracking would not be associated with the correct promise, potentially leading to unhandled rejections not being tracked properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the reason for the rejection to `null`, which would not provide any meaningful information about the failure, making it harder to debug or understand the cause of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `undefined` as the first argument instead of the `rejection`, which would cause the tracking function to not associate the rejection with any promise, leading to a situation where the rejection is not tracked at all.

DONE.
