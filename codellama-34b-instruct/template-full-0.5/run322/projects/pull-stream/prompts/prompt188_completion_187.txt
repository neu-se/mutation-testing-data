  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator will decrement the value of `i` by 1, which would cause the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i+1` operator will increment the value of `i` by 1, which would cause the function to return the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i*2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i*2` operator will multiply the value of `i` by 2, which would cause the function to return every other element in the array instead of the current one.

DONE.
