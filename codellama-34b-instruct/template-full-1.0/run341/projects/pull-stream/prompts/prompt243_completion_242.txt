  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the operand, so the test would pass even if the `abort` variable is not set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && !values(stream).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values(stream).length` expression would return `0` if `stream` is not an object or if it doesn't have a `length` property, which would cause the test to pass even if the `abort` variable is not set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || !stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!stream` expression would return `true` if `stream` is not defined, which would cause the test to pass even if the `abort` variable is not set to `true`.

DONE.
