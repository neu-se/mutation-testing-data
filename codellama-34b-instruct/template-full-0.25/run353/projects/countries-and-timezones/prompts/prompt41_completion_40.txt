  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` variable would be incremented by 1, which would change the result of the `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` variable would be decremented by 1, which would change the result of the `reduce` method.

DONE.
