  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a ternary operator that returns `null` if `abort` is `true`, and `abort` otherwise. Replacing it with the same code fragment would not change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator now returns `null` if `abort` is `false`, and `abort` otherwise. This would cause the function to return `null` when `abort` is `false`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null: null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator now always returns `null`, regardless of the value of `abort`. This would cause the function to always return `null`, which may not be
