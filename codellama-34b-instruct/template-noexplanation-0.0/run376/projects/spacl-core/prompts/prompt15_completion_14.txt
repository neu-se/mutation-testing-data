  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error if the `spec` argument does not contain a slash at the end, even if it is a valid path specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error if the `spec` argument does not contain a slash at the end, even if it is a valid path specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== null
```
This will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error if the `spec` argument does not contain a slash at the end, even if it is a valid path specification.

DONE.
