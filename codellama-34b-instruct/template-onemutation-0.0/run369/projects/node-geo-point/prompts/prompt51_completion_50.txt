  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts the longitude of `point1` from the longitude of `point2`, while the new code fragment adds them together. This would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value, which would be a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
