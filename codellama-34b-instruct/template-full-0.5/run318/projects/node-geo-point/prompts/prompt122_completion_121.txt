  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculateBearing() method to throw a null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculateBearing() method to use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could result in an incorrect calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculateBearing() method to use a random value instead of the actual latitude and longitude values, which could result in an incorrect calculation.

DONE.
