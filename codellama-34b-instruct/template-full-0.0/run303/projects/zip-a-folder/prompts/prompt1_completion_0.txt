  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this code checks if it is not uncompressed. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this code checks if it is high. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is uncompressed, while this code checks if it is medium
