 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `mapper` is falsy, it would return an empty function instead of the `id` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to convert `mapper` to a string, which could cause unexpected results if `mapper` is not a string or a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to convert `mapper` to a number, which could cause unexpected results if `mapper` is not a number.

By introducing these changes, the test suite will have a chance to catch any potential issues with the way the code handles different types of input, or the lack of handling for certain edge cases. DONE.
