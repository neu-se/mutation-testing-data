  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the task property of the head object to undefined, which would cause the code to fail if the task property is used later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the task property of the head object to null, which would cause the code to fail if the task property is used later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the task property of the head object to 0, which would cause the code to fail if the task property is used later.

DONE.
