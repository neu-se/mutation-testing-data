  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra "s" to the word, resulting in a plural form that is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra "es" to the word, resulting in a plural form that is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ves' + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra "ies" to the word, resulting in a plural form that is not correct.

DONE.
