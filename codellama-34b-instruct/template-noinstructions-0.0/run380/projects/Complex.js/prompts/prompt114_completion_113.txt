  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` would return a floating-point number, while the original code would return a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` would return an integer, while the original code would return a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` would return a string representation of the complex number, while the original code would return the complex number itself.

DONE.
