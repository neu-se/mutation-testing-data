  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the original array, while `splice` mutates the original array. In this case, the original code fragment is returning a copy of the array, while the modified code fragment is mutating the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array comprising the elements of the original array and the arguments passed to it, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` mutates the original array, while `slice` does not.

DONE.
