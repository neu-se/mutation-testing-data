  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the stack trace to be printed in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing all elements except the first, which would cause the first line of the stack trace to be omitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["extra line"]).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method adds a new element to the end of the array, which would cause an extra line to be added to the stack trace.

DONE.
