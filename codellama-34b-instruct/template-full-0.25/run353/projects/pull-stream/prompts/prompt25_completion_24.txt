  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if the arguments have different types or values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument has been changed from `ref[1]` to `ref[2]`, which could cause the function to behave differently if the third argument is used in the function's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument has been changed from `ref[1]` to `ref[1] + 1`, which could cause the function to behave differently if the third argument is used in the function's logic.

DONE.
