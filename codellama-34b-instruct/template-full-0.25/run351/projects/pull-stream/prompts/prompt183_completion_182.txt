  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while this new code fragment checks if `i` is strictly greater than the length of the array. This means that the original code fragment would return `true` if `i` is equal to the length of the array, while this new code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while this new code fragment checks if `i` is less than the length of the array minus one. This means that the original code fragment would return `true` if `i` is equal to the length of the array, while this new code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
