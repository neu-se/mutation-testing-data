  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended, cb` passes both `ended` and `cb` as arguments to the `read` function, while the replacement code fragment `ended && cb` only passes `cb` if `ended` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended, cb` passes both `ended` and `cb` as arguments to the `read` function, while the replacement code fragment `ended || cb` only passes `cb` if `ended` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended, cb` passes both `ended` and `cb` as arguments to the `read` function, while the replacement code fragment `!ended && cb` only passes `cb` if `ended` is fals
