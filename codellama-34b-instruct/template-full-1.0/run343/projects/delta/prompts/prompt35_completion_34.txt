  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string, so `typeof b !== 'object'` would not catch the case where `b` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` could be `null`, which would pass the test in the original code but not the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` would catch both `b` being `null` or `undefined`, and also convert `b` to a boolean.

DONE.
