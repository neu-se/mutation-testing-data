  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be pushed to the `ops` array even if it has no attributes, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be pushed to the `ops` array even if it has no attributes, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be pushed to the `ops` array even if it has no attributes, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
