  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error || "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the error is a string, while the new code fragment checks if the error is truthy. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a non-string value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the error is a string, while the new code fragment checks if the error is a string and is truthy. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected with a string value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && typeof error === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the error is a string, while the new code fragment checks if the error is a string and is truthy. This could potentially cause the promise to be rejected
