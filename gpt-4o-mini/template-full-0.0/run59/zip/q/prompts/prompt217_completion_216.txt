Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `value` with `null` would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to `null`, which is not the intended behavior of returning the original promise or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `value` with `undefined` would lead to the function returning a promise that resolves to `undefined`, which may not be the expected outcome if the input was a valid promise or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `value` with a string literal would cause the function to always return a promise that resolves to the string "string", regardless of the actual input, thus ignoring the original promise or value.

DONE.
