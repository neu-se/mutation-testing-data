  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the coordinates property is accessed as an object with a value of an array, while in the mutated code, the value is accessed as an array with a value of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the coordinates property is accessed as an object with a value of an array, while in the mutated code, the value is accessed as an array with a value of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the coordinates property is accessed as an object with a value of an array, while in the mutated code, the value is accessed as an array with a value of an object.

DONE.
