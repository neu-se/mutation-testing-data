 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns `undefined` when there's no next operation, causing a TypeError in the following line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek().type
