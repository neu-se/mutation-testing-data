  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `aborted` is falsy. If `aborted` is falsy, the new code fragment would return `cb(aborted)` which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while the new code fragment checks if both `abort` and `aborted` are true. If `abort` is true and `aborted` is false, the new code fragment would return `cb(aborted)` which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || !aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while the new code
