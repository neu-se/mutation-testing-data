  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned a new instance of `Delta`, while the replaced code returns an empty `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Delta(this.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned a new instance of `Delta` with the same operations as `this`, while the replaced code returns a new instance of `Delta` with the same operations as `this.ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Delta(Object.keys(this))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned a new instance of `Delta` with the same operations as `this`, while the replaced code returns a new instance of `Delta` with the same operations as the enumerable properties of `this`.

DONE.
