Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(c => c !== undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from mapping over the countries to filtering out any undefined values, which would not return the transformed country objects as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach(c => getCountry(c, options));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `forEach` instead of `map`, which does not return a new array of transformed country objects, effectively discarding the results of `getCountry`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(c => getCountry(c, options).name);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to return only the `name` property of each country instead of the entire country object, potentially leading to a loss of important information.

DONE.
