Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array instead of the last, which would change the order of operations and potentially lead to incorrect results when processing the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(this.ops.length - 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the array in place and can lead to unexpected results if the array is empty or if the index is out of bounds, whereas `pop()` safely removes the last element without such concerns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it clears the entire operations array instead of just removing the last operation, which would result in the loss of all previously stored operations.

DONE.
