  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const _verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the underscore '_' causes the variable to be treated as private, which means it cannot be accessed outside of the class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable is now a mutable value and can be reassigned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const pseudoVerb = verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable 'pseudoVerb' is now a constant and does not point to the same memory location as the original variable 'verb'.

DONE.
