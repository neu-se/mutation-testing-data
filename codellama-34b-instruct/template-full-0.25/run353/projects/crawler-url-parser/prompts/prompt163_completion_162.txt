  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if the string starts with the specified string, while `includes()` checks if the string contains the specified string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` checks if the string contains the specified string, and returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match()` checks if the string matches the specified regular expression, and returns an array of matches.

DONE.
