 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' property of 'z' with Infinity, instead of checking if either 'z' or the current complex number is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'Complex.INFINITY' when subtracting two complex numbers with Infinity 'im' property, regardless of the 're' property values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the current complex number with Infinity, which is not the same as checking if either part is Infinity.

DONE.
