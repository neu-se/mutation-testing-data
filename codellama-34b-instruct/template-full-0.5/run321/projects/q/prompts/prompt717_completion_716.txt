  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` would be called with the argument `"values"`, which is not a valid method name for the `Promise.prototype` object. This would cause an error to be thrown, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of mutation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` would be called with the argument `"length"`, which is not a valid method name for the `Promise.prototype` object. This would cause an error to be thrown, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of mutation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"slice"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` would be called with the argument `"slice"`, which is not a valid method name for the `Promise.prototype` object. This would cause an
