  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.match(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match()` is not the same as `super[Symbol.match]` in terms of how they handle regular expressions. `match()` will try to match the entire string, while `super[Symbol.match]` will try to match a substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.replace](string, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` will replace all occurrences of the regular expression in the string, while `super[Symbol.match]` will only match the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.split](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` will split the string into an array based on the regular expression, while `super[Symbol.match]` will return an array of matches.

DONE.
