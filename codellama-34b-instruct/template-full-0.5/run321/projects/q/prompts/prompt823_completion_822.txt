  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Dummy error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` method to throw an error, whereas the original code would only log the error to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Dummy error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `timeout` method to throw an error, whereas the original code would only reject the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Dummy error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delay` method to throw an error, whereas the original code would only reject the promise with the error.

DONE.
