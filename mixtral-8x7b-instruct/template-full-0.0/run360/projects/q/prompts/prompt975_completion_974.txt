 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the native Array.prototype.slice method, while `array_slice` is an alias used in the provided code. Changing it could cause issues if the code relies on the non-standard `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and attempting to call it would throw a TypeError. This would expose potential issues in the error handling of the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of an object's own enumerable properties, not an array-like object that can be sliced like `array_slice`. This would expose potential issues in the type checking and error handling of the test suite.

DONE.
