 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the word "die" and returns "dice", while the modified code fragment would return "dies" for the input "die".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dices'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the word "die" and returns "dice", while the modified code fragment would return "dices" for the input "die". This is different from the expected behavior of returning "dice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a string value for the input "die", while the modified code fragment returns a function value. This is likely to cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `addRule` function.

DONE.
