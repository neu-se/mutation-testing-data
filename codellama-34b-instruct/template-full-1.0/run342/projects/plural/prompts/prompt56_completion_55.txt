  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'xes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring replace function would add 'xes' instead of 'ves' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'xes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would add 'xes' instead of 'ves' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'shes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would add 'shes' instead of 'ves' to the end of the word.

DONE.
