  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(Q.reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected promise, which would have different behavior than resolving with a resolved promise.

DONE.
