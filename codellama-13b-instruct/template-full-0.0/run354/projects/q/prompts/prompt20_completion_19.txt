  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `x` is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore the code would not run as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `x` is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore the code would not run as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `x` is not defined in the original code fragment, and therefore the code would not run as intended.

DONE.
