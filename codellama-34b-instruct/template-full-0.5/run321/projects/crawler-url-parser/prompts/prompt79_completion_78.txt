  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'div'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment selects all `<a>` elements, while this code fragment selects all `<div>` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment selects all `<a>` elements, while this code fragment selects only `<a>` elements with an `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a:not([href])'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment selects all `<a>` elements, while this code fragment selects only `<a>` elements without an `href` attribute.

DONE.
