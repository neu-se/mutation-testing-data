  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is expected to be an array of promises, while `[]` is an empty array. The `all` method would wait for all promises in the array to be settled, but since the array is empty, there are no promises to wait for, making the method return an already resolved promise with an empty array as its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `promises` is expected to be an array of promises, while `void 0` is `undefined`. The `all` method would attempt to iterate over the array and wait for all promises to be settled, but since `promises` is `undefined`, it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foobar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prom
