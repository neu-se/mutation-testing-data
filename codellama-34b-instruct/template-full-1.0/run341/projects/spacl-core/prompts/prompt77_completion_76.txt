  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the array, which could cause problems if the `Policy` object is mutated while iterating over the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the `matches` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.filter()` method filters the array based on the provided condition, which could cause the `matches` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
