  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then` is a function and would be called with the promise as its context, whereas `object` is an object and would be passed as the first argument to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.thenResolve` is a function and would be called with the promise as its context, whereas `object` is an object and would be passed as the first argument to the `thenResolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.thenReject` is a function and would be called with the promise as its context, whereas `object` is an object and would be passed as the first argument to the `thenReject` method.

DONE.
