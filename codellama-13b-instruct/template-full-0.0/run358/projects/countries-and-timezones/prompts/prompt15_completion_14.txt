  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would return `null` if the `tz.r` property is not undefined, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would return `null` if the `tz.r` property is null, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would return `null` if the `tz.r` property is 0, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
