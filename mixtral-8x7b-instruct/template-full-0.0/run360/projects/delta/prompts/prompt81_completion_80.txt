 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array and returns it, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array and returns it, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.sort
