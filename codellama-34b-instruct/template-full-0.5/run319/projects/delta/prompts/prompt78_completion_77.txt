  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat `delete` properties as strings instead of numbers, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat `delete` properties as numbers when they are actually strings, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete !== 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat `delete` properties as non-numeric values when they are actually numeric, which could lead to incorrect calculations and errors.

DONE.
