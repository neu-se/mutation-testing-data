  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and the `drain` function may not handle `undefined` values in the same way as `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is not the same as `null`, and the `drain` function may not handle `null` values in the same way as the `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done, done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is not the same as `null`, and the `drain` function may not handle `done` callbacks in the same way as `null` values.

DONE.
