  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `point` object has the `type` property, but not the `coordinates` property. By adding the additional check for the `coordinates` property, the code would return a different result if the `coordinates` property is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `coordinates` property is present, but not the length of the `coordinates` array. By adding the additional check for the length of the `coordinates` array, the code would return a different result if the `coordinates` array has a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
