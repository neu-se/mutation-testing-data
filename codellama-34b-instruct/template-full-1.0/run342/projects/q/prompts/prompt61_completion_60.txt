  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because in Node.js, `process` is a global object that references the current process, while in the browser, `window` is a global object that references the current window. Replacing `process` with `document` would cause the code to break in Node.js.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in Node.js, `process` is defined and `isNodeJS` is set to `true`, while in the browser, `process` is undefined. Replacing `process` with `undefined` would cause the code to behave as if it were running in the browser, even in Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because in Node.js, `process` is defined and `isNodeJS` is set to `true`, while in the browser, `process` is undefined. Replacing `
