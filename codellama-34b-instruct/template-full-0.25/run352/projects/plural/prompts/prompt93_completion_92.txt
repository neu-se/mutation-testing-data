  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, "chilli" should be "chili".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, "chilli" should be "chili".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, "chilli" should be "chili".
