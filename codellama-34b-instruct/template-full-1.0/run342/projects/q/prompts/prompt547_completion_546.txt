  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the `async` function to return a rejected promise immediately, whereas `reject` will cause the function to return a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception` will cause the `async` function to return a rejected promise immediately, whereas `reject` will cause the function to return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will cause the `async` function to return a rejected promise immediately, whereas `reject` will cause the function to return a resolved promise.

DONE.
