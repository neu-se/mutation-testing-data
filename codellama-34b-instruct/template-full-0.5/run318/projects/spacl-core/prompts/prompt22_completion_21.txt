  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.search]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.search` is a different symbol than `Symbol.match`, and it would cause the matcher to use a different method for matching the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.replace]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.replace` is a different symbol than `Symbol.match`, and it would cause the matcher to use a different method for matching the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.split]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.split` is a different symbol than `Symbol.match`, and it would cause the matcher to use a different method for matching the path.

DONE.
