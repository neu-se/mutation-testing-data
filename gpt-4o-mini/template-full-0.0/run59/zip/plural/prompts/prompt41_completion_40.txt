Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not modify the original string and can handle negative indices differently, potentially leading to unexpected results if the string length is less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code will always start from the second character of the string, effectively omitting the first character, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` will attempt to extract characters from index 0 to `w.length - 3`, which could lead to incorrect results for words that are shorter than 3 characters or do not require the last two characters to be removed.

DONE.
