  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are both methods of the `Promise` object, but they have different purposes. `resolve` is used to fulfill a promise with a value, while `reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason. Using `resolve` in place of `reject` would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Promise` to be rejected with a new error instead of the original error. This could cause the code that uses the promise to handle the error differently, or it could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Promise` to be
