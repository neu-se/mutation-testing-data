  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) || isNodeFrame(line) || line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the line, regardless of whether it is an internal frame or a node frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) && isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the line if it is both an internal frame and a node frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) || !isNodeFrame(line) || line
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line if it is not an internal frame or a node frame.

DONE.
