  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to pass through all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to pass through all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `null` instead of `true`, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to pass through all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before.

DONE.
