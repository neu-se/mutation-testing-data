  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number and is a property of the `Math` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number and is a property of the `Math` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number and is a property of the `Math` object.

DONE.
