 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 for the imaginary part, even when the original code would return a non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when b is 0, while the original code would return a complex infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the angle of the complex number in radians, while the original code returns the hyperbolic tangent of the complex number.

DONE.
