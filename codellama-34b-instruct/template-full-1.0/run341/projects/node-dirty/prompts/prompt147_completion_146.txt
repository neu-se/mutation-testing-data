  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not trigger the `for...of` loop because `cbs` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `cb` function with the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = (err) => cb(`Error: ${err}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different argument.

DONE.
