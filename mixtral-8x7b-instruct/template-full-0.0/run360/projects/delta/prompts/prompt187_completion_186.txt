 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access the `compose` method on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access the `compose` method on `Object.prototype`, as it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new empty function, which does not have the `compose` method, causing a `TypeError`.

DONE.
