  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the current element in the iteration, rather than the element passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because `el` would refer to the current element in the iteration, rather than the element passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `a` element within the current element, rather than the current element itself.

DONE.
