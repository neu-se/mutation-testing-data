Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'

module.exports = function count (max) {
  var i = 0; max = max || Infinity
  return function (end, cb) {
    if(end) return cb && <PLACEHOLDER>(end)
    if(i > max)
      return cb(true)
    cb(null, i++)
  }
}



```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
