  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method instead of accessing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(descriptor)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the method to the descriptor object, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(descriptor)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the method with the descriptor object as its context, which could affect its behavior.

DONE.
