 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" From previous event:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string now includes a space before "From", changing the appearance of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation is removed, changing the separator format in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\nAnother event separator:\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original separator is replaced with a new one, changing the meaning of the stack trace separator.

DONE.
