  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would never enter the `if` statement, even if `b` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be doubled, which could result in a different value for `cos(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b << 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be shifted to the left by 1 bit, which could result in a different value for `cos(b)`.

DONE.
