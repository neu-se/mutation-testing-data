  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment returns the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next operation in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment returns the current operation.

DONE.
