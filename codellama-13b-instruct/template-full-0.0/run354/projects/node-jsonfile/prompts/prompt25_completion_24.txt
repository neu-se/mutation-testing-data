  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `content` variable, which is a buffer, and the resulting string is then parsed as JSON. This would cause the JSON parser to throw an error if the buffer contains invalid JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method is called on the `content` variable, which is a buffer, and the resulting object is then stringified using the `stringify()` method. This would cause the `stringify()` method to throw an error if the object contains circular references or other non-serializable data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toJSON()` method is called on the `content` variable, which is a buffer, and the resulting object is then stringified using the `stringify()` method. This would
