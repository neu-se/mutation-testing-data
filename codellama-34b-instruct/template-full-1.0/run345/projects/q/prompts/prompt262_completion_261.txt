  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(fulfill(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object, while the `fulfill` function is used to resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(process.exit())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object, while the `process.exit()` function terminates the Node.js process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(that.reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object, while `that.reject(value)` would pass the value to the `reject` function of a different promise.

DONE.
