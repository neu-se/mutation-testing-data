  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be reversed, which would change the order of the arguments passed to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a new array containing all elements of the `nodeArgs` array except the first element, which would change the arguments passed to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat([1, 2, 3])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add the elements `1`, `2`, and `3` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which would change the arguments passed to the `post` method.

DONE.
