  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `b + 1` is not equal to `b`, and the resulting complex number would have a different real and imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `b - 1` is not equal to `b`, and the resulting complex number would have a different real and imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `b * 2` is not equal to `b`, and the resulting complex number would have a different real and imaginary part.

DONE.
