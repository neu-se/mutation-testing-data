  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, regardless of the input, causing the function to always return a falsey value, even when the input is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the input, causing the function to always return a truthy value, even when the input is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the original PLACEHOLDER code fragment, which could cause the function to return a different result for the same input.

DONE.
