  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being invoked on the object would change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because the context of the invoked method would change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply2"
```
This would result in different behavior because a different method with the same name but different behavior would be called.

DONE.
