  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and therefore the `when` function would not be able to track its resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and therefore the `when` function would not be able to track its resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a promise, and therefore the `when` function would not be able to track its resolution.

DONE.
