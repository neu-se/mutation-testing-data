  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` value would be shifted by 180 degrees, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value, leading to a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` value would be doubled, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value, leading to a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` value would be shifted by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value, leading to a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
