  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a method that applies a function to an array of arguments, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a method that applies a function to an array of arguments, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.denodeify` is a method that wraps a NodeJS continuation passing function and returns an equivalent version that returns a promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
