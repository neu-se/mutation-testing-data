  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the typeof options, which can be either a string or an object. Replacing it with a string comparison would cause the code to enter the if block even if the options argument is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the typeof options, which can be either a string or an object. Replacing it with a property access would cause the code to throw an error if the options argument is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the typeof options, which can be either a string or an object. Replacing it with a property access and a typeof check would cause the code to throw an error if the options argument is a string.

DONE.
