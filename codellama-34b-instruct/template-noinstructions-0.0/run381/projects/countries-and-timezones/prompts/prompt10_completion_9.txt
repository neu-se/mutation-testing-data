  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the `if` statement, even if `result[country]` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `if` statement, even if `result[country]` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the `if` statement, even if `result[country]` is not defined.

DONE.
