  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `reduce` function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `reduce` function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `reduce` function to produce a different output.

DONE.
