Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `prop` with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected `prop` function, leading to potential runtime errors when the returned value is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `prop` would result in the function returning `undefined`, which would not be callable, causing any subsequent calls to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `prop` with a function that always returns `false` would change the logic of the returned function, causing it to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the input, thus failing to perform the intended checks.

DONE.
