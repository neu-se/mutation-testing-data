  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `!==` operator would cause the loop to continue even if the `fn` function returns `false`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality. In this case, the `===` operator would cause the loop to continue only if the `fn` function returns `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case,
