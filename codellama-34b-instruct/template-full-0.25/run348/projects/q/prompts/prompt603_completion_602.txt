  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Test error")))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q.when(Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value.

DONE.
