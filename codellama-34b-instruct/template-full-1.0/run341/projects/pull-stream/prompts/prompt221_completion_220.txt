  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object that is being passed to the `cb` function, while `null` is a null value that will not be recognized as an object by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object that is being passed to the `cb` function, while `undefined` is a value that is not defined and will not be recognized as an object by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object that is being passed to the `cb` function, while `Data` is a function that is not being used in the original code.

DONE.
