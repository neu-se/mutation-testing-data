 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'coordinates2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method would now check for a non-existent `coordinates2` property instead of the expected `coordinates` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'altitude'
