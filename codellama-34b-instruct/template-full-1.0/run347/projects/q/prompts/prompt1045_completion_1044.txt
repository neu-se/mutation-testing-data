  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tear"
```
This would result in different behavior because "tear" is a different property than "tail" in the JavaScript object returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return the `head` property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because "next" is a different property than "tail" in the JavaScript object returned by `ends.promise.get("head")`.

DONE.
