  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with only one argument, whereas the original code fragment called the function with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with two arguments, but the second argument would be an empty object instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with two arguments, but the second argument would be a different URL than the original code fragment.

DONE.
