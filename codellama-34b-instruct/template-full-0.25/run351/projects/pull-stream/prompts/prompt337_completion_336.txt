  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the `data` object, while the new code fragment `field(data) + 1` returns the value of the `field` function applied to the `data` object, plus 1. This could cause the `seen` object to be populated with different keys, leading to different behavior in the `filter` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the `data` object, while the new code fragment `field(data) * 2` returns the value of the `field` function applied to the `data` object, multiplied by 2. This could cause the `seen` object to be populated with different keys, leading to different behavior in the `filter` function
