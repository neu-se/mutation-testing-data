 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would start rejecting promises instead of resolving them when the queue is closed, which could cause issues in the code that uses this queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would start sending notifications instead of resolving promises when the queue is closed, which could cause issues in the code that uses this queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would try to resolve the `promise` property of the `ends.promise` object, which is not a function and would cause an error. This would cause the `close` method to fail and not resolve the `closed` promise, which could cause issues in the code that uses this queue.

DONE.
