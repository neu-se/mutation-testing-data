 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-y, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude calculation would be multiplied by -1, causing the destination point to be on the opposite side of the Earth.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
y, 1 / x
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude calculation would be inverted, causing the destination point to be in the wrong direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
y * Math.random(), x * Math.random()
