  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the code to not function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

DONE.
