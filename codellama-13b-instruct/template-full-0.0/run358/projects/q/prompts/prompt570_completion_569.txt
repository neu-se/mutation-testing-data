  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `result` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `callback` and `errback` variables, which are not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `result` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
