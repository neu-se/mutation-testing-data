  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the exact word "goose", while this new code fragment would match any word that ends with "goos", which could include words like "does" or "show".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the exact word "goose", while this new code fragment would match any word that ends with "geese", which could include words like "geese" or "creeps".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the exact word "goose", while this new code fragment would match any word that ends with "goose" followed by an "s", which could include words like "gooses" or "rooses".

DONE.
