  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `call` function as the `this` value, instead of the original `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `call` function as the `this` value, instead of the original `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third argument of the `call` function as the `this` value, instead of the original `arguments` object.

DONE.
