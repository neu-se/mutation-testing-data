  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `timezones` object as an argument, rather than the `id` variable as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id].name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` property of the `timezones` object as an argument, rather than the `id` variable as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id].timezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `timezone` property of the `timezones` object as an argument, rather than the `id` variable as in the original code.

DONE.
