  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return `NaN` instead of a valid complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would return a valid complex number instead of `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a valid complex number.

DONE.
