  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = op.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `op.retain` to `thisOp.retain`, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment was meant to push the `otherOp` object to the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` object to the `delta` array, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment was meant to assign the value of `op.retain` to `thisOp.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.retain` to `thisOp.retain`, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment was meant to
