  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, while the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed and the data has been flushed to the underlying system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed and the data has been flushed to the underlying system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, while the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed and the data has been flushed to the underlying system.

DONE.
