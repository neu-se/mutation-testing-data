  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the absolute value of `a` instead of the absolute value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the absolute value of `b` instead of the absolute value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the absolute value of `a + b` instead of the absolute value of `a` or `b`.

DONE.
