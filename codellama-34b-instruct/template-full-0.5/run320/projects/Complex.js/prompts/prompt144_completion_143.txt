  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function would return `true` for any value that is zero, not just the value of the `im` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function would return `true` for any value that is zero, not just the value of the `im` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function would return `true` for any value that is zero, not just the value of the `re` property.

DONE.
