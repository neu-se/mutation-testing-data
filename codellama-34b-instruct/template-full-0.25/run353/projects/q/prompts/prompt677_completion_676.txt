  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise.prototype` object, rather than `undefined`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` would create a copy of the `args` array, rather than passing the original array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat()]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` would create a new array by concatenating `args` with an empty array, rather than passing the original array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
