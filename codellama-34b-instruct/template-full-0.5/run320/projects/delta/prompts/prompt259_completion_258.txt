  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.insert`, and the code would behave differently based on the value of `otherOp.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.insert`, and the code would behave differently based on the value of `thisOp.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `otherOp.insert`, and the code would behave differently based on the value of `null`.

DONE.
