  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` and `replace` are different methods with different purposes and different behaviors. `substr` returns a portion of the original string while `replace` replaces a portion of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` and `replace` are different methods with different purposes and different behaviors. `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurence of the specified value while `replace` replaces a portion of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` and `replace` are different methods with different purposes and different behaviors. `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the specified value while `replace` replaces a portion of the original string.

DONE.
