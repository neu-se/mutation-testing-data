 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.constructor.name === "GeneratorFunction"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the generator is an instance of the built-in `GeneratorFunction` constructor, which is not the case for SpiderMonkey's Python-style generators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.constructor.prototype.constructor.name === "GeneratorFunction"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the prototype of the generator's constructor is an instance of the built-in `GeneratorFunction` constructor, which is not the case for SpiderMonkey's Python-style generators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.constructor.prototype.constructor.name === "GeneratorFunction" && typeof generator.return === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the prototype of the generator's constructor is an instance of the built-in `GeneratorFunction` constructor and if the generator has
