  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitUnless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emitUnless` method is not defined in the `EventEmitter` class, and would therefore result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitAuto
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emitAuto` method is not defined in the `EventEmitter` class, and would therefore result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emitContinuously
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emitContinuously` method is not defined in the `EventEmitter` class, and would therefore result in an error.

DONE.
