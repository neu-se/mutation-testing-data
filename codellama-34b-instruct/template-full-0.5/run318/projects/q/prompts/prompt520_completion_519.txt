  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the reason, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always notify the promise with the reason, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the reason, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
