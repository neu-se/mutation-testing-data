 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(array) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's internal `[[Class]]` property, which is not the recommended way to check for arrays. It may produce false positives for array-like objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `array` is an instance of Array, which is not the same as checking if it's an actual Array object. This may produce false negatives for array-like objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(array) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `array` is iterable and has the `slice` method, which is not the same as checking if it's an actual Array object. This may produce false negatives for array
