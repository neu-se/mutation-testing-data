  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `void 0` are not the same value, and the `null` value would be passed as the `this` argument to the function, which could potentially cause issues if the function relies on `this` being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is changed from `1` to `2`, which would result in the function being called with one fewer argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is being replaced with `call`, which would cause the function to be called with the arguments provided as an array, rather than
