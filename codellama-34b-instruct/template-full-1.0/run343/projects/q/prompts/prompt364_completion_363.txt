  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled promise would be passed as an argument to the `tap` method, which would result in the promise being awaited for and the rejection reason would be overwritten.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would be passed as an argument to the `tap` method, which would result in the callback being called with the resolved value and the rejection reason would be overwritten.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected callback would be passed as an argument to the `tap` method, which would result in the callback being called with the rejection exception and the resolved value would be overwritten.

DONE.
