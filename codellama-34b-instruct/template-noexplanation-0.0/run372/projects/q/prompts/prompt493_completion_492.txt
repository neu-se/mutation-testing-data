  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This change will cause the `rejected` function to always return `false`, which will result in the promise being fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || true
```
This change will cause the `rejected` function to always return `true`, which will result in the promise being rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This change will cause the `rejected` function to always return the opposite of what it would have returned, which will result in the promise being fulfilled if it would have been rejected, and vice versa.

DONE.
