 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty array, instead of slicing the given arguments array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError: nodeArgs.push is not a function` when trying to push the error handler to `nodeArgs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 42, instead of the correct `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
