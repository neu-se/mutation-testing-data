  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `base` Delta, and by subtracting 1, the index would be shifted to the previous position, potentially causing the `slice` method to return a different slice of the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `base` Delta, and by adding 1, the index would be shifted to the next position, potentially causing the `slice` method to return a different slice of the `base` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is used to keep track of the current index in the `base` Delta, and by
