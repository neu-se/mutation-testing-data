  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the "prototype" property from the resulting array, which could cause issues if the "prototype" property is used in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && typeof key !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude all string properties from the resulting array, which could cause issues if string properties are used in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "length"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the "length" property from the resulting array, which could cause issues if the "length" property is used in the code.

DONE.
