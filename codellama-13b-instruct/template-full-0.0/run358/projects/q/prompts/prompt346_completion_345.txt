  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the new Error() object would be thrown instead of the original exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined would be thrown instead of the original exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null would be thrown instead of the original exception object.

DONE.
