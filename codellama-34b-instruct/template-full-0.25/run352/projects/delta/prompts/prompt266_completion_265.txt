  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to retain one more character than intended, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to retain one fewer character than intended, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` operation to retain twice as many characters as intended, potentially causing the test to fail.

DONE.
