  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always enable gzip compression, regardless of the value of the `compression` option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the compression level to 9, regardless of the value of the `compression` option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, { store: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always store the files without compression, regardless of the value of the `compression` option.

DONE.
