  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses subtraction, while this replacement uses addition. This would cause the resulting value to be different, which could lead to incorrect calculations and test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses multiplication, while this replacement uses exponentiation. This would cause the resulting value to be different, which could lead to incorrect calculations and test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses division, while this replacement uses multiplication. This would cause the resulting value to be different, which could lead to incorrect calculations and test failures.

DONE.
