  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is a string representing the operation to be performed, and adding 1 to it would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is a string representing the operation to be performed, and concatenating the string "1" to it would result in a different operation being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is a string representing the operation to be performed, and multiplying it by 2 would result in a different operation being performed.

DONE.
