  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it will have the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text) && tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code fragment, as it will always return `true` if `text` is included in `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text) || tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code fragment, as it will always return `true` if `text` is included in `tmpUrl.text`.

DONE.
