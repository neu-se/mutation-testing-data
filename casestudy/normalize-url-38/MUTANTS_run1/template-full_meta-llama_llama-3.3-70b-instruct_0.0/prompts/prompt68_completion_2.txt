Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is being applied to the pathname instead of the hostname, which could lead to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is being applied to the lowercase version of the hostname, which could lead to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain if the hostname contains uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname + 'example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is being applied to the hostname concatenated with a string, which could lead to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain or incorrect matches due to the added string.

DONE.
