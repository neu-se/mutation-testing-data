  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `asin` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the replacement would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` and `asin` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the replacement would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['sin']
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `asin` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the replacement would cause the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
