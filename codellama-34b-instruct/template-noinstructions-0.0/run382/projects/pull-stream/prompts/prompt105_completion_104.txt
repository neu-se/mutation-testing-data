  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and the `drain` function may not handle `undefined` values in the same way as `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value for the `drain` function, but it may not be the intended behavior for the `onEnd` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not the same as `null`, and the `drain` function may not handle empty strings in the same way as `null` values.

DONE.
