  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a new rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a method that creates a new rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which can be used to create and manipulate promises, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and manipulate promises.

DONE.
