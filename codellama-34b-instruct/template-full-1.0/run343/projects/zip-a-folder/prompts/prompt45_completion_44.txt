  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would throw a `TypeError` if `src` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would throw a `TypeError` if `src` is not a string or a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would create a folder named 'hello' instead of the correct folder.

DONE.
