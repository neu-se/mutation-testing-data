  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!this._writeStream) {
  throw new Error('Write stream is not initialized.');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the write stream is not initialized, whereas the original code would not throw an error in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._writeStream.closed) {
  throw new Error('Write stream is closed.');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the write stream is closed, whereas the original code would not throw an error in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this._queue.length > 0) {
  this._queue = [];
  this.emit('flush');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the queue and emit a flush event, whereas the original code would not do this.

DONE.
