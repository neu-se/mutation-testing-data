  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is less than 0. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
