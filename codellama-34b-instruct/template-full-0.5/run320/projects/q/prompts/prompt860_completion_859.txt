  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would not be executed, and the promise would be resolved with the value `null` instead of being rejected with the `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and any code that relies on the specific error message would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of being rejected with the `Error` object.

DONE.
