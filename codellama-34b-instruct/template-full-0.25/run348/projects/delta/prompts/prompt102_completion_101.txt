  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `ops` array, instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ops` array, instead of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove a range of elements from the `ops` array, instead of just one element.

DONE.
