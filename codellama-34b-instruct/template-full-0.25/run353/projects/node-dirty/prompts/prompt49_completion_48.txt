  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different argument, which could cause it to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different context, which could cause it to produce a different output.

DONE.
