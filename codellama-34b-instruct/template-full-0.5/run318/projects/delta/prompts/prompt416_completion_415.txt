  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `length` to determine the number of iterations, while `length - 1` would result in one less iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `length` to determine the number of iterations, while `Math.abs(length)` would result in the same number of iterations if `length` is positive, but a different number of iterations if `length` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `length` to determine the number of iterations, while `length + 1` would result in one more iteration.

DONE.
