  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to `1`, while the new code fragment checks if `1` is not equal to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to `0`, while the new code fragment checks if `0` is not equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to `NaN`, while the new code fragment checks if `NaN` is not equal to `b`.

DONE.
