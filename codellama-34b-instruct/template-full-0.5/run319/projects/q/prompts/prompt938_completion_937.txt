  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take only the first two arguments of the `Q.nbind` function, instead of all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take only the last two arguments of the `Q.nbind` function, instead of all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take only the last three arguments of the `Q.nbind` function, instead of all of them.

DONE.
