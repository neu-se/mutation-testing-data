  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the `isFulfilled` function with different code fragments that would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object.inspect().state === "fulfilled" || object.inspect().state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a promise to be fulfilled if it is either fulfilled or rejected, rather than just fulfilled. This would cause the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` for rejected promises, which might not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a promise to be fulfilled if it is still in the pending state, rather than checking whether it has been resolved. This would cause the `isFulfilled` function to return `true` for promises that have not yet been resolved, which might not be desirable.

Option 3: The PL
