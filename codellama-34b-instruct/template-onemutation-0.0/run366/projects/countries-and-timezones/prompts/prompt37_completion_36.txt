  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data.timezones` is an object, while `data.timezones.length` is a number. The `length` property of an object is the number of elements in the object, which is not the same as the object itself.

DONE.
