  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input is an object, but replacing it with null would cause the check to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input is an object, but replacing it with undefined would cause the check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ type: 'Point', coordinates: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the input is an object with specific properties, but replacing it with an object with different properties would cause the checks to fail.

DONE.
