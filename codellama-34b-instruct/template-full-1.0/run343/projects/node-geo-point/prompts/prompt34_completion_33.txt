  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in a calculation of the sine of the product of `point1Rad` and `cos(point2Rad)`, instead of calculating the cosine of the product, as in the original code. This would produce a different output value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 +
```
This would result in a calculation of `1 + r`, instead of calculating `r` as in the original code. This would produce a different output value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radius
```
This would result in a calculation of `radius * cos(point2Rad) * cos(a)`, instead of calculating `cos(point2Rad) * cos(a)` as in the original code. This would produce a different output value.

DONE.
