  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the array element, while this replacement code fragment would access the next element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the array element, while this replacement code fragment would access the previous element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the index variable to access the array element, while this replacement code fragment would access the element at twice the index.

DONE.
