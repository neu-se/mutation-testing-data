Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek().attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the attributes of the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling if the next operation is not the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || { default: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a default attribute object when the original operation has no attributes, which could alter the expected behavior of the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ custom: 'value' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected attributes with a static object, which does not reflect the actual operation's attributes, potentially causing the predicate to behave incorrectly based on the wrong data.

DONE.
