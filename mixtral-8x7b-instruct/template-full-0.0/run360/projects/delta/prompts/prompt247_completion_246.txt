 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the length of the deletion to 0, regardless of the original `opLength`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation, rather than the length of the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length of the deletion to a random value, rather than the original `opLength`.

DONE.
