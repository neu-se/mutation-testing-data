  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to `null`, which means that the `cb` function would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"null"` is a string value that is not equal to `null`.

DONE.
