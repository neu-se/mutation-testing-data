!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `isPromise`, so the resulting promise would be rejected if `isPromise` is truthy, and fulfilled if `isPromise` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method. If the object is not a promise, but it has a `then` method, it would be considered a promise-like object and the resulting promise would be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if the object is a fulfilled promise. If the object is not a promise, but it has a `then` method, it would be considered ful
