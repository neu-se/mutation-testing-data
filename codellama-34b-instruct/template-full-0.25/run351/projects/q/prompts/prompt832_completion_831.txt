  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a fulfilled promise, rather than a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a null value, rather than a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with an undefined value, rather than a promise.

DONE.
