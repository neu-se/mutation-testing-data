  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is always true when the `map` function is called, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if the `map` function is not currently busy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy && !aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!busy` check would only be performed if the `aborted` flag is not set, so the `if` statement would be executed even if the `map` function is currently busy and the `aborted` flag is not set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` flag would be checked directly, without checking if the `map` function is currently busy or not. So the `if` statement would be executed even if the `map` function is currently busy and the `aborted` flag is not set.
