  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(object)` expression would be evaluated before the `dispatch` method is called, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the result of the `Q(object)` expression instead of the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on the `object` itself instead of the result of the `Q(object)` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called on the `Q` object instead of the `object` itself.

DONE.
