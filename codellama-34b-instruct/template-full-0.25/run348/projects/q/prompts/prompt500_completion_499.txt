  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behavior when it comes to handling arguments. `call` expects a list of arguments, while `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the first argument, and its arguments will be the remaining arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, while `apply` and `call` invoke the function and return its return value.

DONE.
