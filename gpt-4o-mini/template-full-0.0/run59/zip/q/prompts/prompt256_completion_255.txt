Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the promise to resolve even if it has already been resolved, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise's state management.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow resolution if `resolvedPromise` is explicitly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined`, which could prevent the promise from resolving under certain conditions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow resolution if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`, which could lead to situations where a promise that has been resolved with a value (but not yet fulfilled) would still be allowed to resolve again, potentially causing logical errors in promise handling.

DONE.
