 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any input, while the original code fragment would call the `query` method on the `policy` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` for any input, while the original code fragment would call the `query` method on the `policy` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `query` method with the wrong arguments, while the original code fragment would call the `query` method with the correct arguments.

DONE.
