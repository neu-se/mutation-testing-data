  Option 1:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because using the second element of the `other.ops` array instead of the first would cause `concat` to compose the two `Delta` objects incorrectly, resulting in a different final state.

Option 2:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the `other.ops[0]` object with `null` would cause `concat` to throw an error, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because using the first element of the `this.ops` array instead of the `other.ops[0]` object would cause `concat` to compose the two `Delta` objects incorrectly, resulting in a different final state.

DONE.
