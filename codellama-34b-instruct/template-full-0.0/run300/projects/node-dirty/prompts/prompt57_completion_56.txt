  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called twice, once for each event emitted by the `writeStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called only once, when the `writeStream` is closed, and not when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called only when an error occurs, and not when the `drain` event is emitted.

DONE.
