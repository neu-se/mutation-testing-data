  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `OpIterator` object, which would return the next operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the iterator without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation in the iterator without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
