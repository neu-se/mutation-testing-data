  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 10, while the buggy code uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 10 with a default value of 0. This would cause the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 10, while the buggy code uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the power of 10 with a default value of 1. This would cause the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
