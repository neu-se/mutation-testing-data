  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:..+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a newline, instead of matching any character except for a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a newline, and then match one or more repetitions of that character, instead of matching any character except for a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a newline, and then match zero or more repetitions of that character, instead of matching any character except for a slash.

DONE.
