  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `,` operator, which would cause the `verb` variable to be concatenated with the `path` variable instead of being used as a separate argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb.toLowerCase(), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is called on the `verb` variable, which would cause the `verb` to be converted to lowercase before being passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getPath()` method is called on the `ctx` variable, which would cause the `path` variable to be passed as an argument instead of the `ctx` variable.

DONE.
