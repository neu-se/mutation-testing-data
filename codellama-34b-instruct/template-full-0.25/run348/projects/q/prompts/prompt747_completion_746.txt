  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).catch(onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `catch` method on the result of the `then` method, which is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).finally(onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `finally` method on the result of the `then` method, which is not defined in the original code fragment.

DONE.
