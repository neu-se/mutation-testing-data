  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `places` argument is used to calculate the divisor for rounding, but in this new code, it is hardcoded to 100, which would result in a different rounding behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `places` argument is used to calculate the divisor for rounding, but in this new code, it is hardcoded to 0, which would result in a different rounding behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `places` argument is used to calculate the divisor for rounding, but in this new code, it is not a number and would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
