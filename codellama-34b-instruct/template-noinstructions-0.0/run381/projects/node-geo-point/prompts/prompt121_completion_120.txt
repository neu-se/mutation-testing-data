  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method is not being called, and the `this` object is not being passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method is being called on the `GeoPoint` class, rather than on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return point.calculateBearing(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method is being called on the `point` object, rather than on the `this` object.

DONE.
