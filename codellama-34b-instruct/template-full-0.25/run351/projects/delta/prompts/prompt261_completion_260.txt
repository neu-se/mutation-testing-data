  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` and `diff` are different methods of the `AttributeMap` class, and they have different purposes. `invert` is used to invert the attributes of an operation, while `diff` is used to compute the difference between two operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` and `diff` are different methods of the `AttributeMap` class, and they have different purposes. `compose` is used to compose two attribute maps, while `diff` is used to compute the difference between two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` and `diff` are different methods of the `AttributeMap` class, and they have different purposes. `transform` is used to transform an attribute map, while `diff` is used to compute the difference between
