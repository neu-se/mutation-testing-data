  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential value for a given number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the base raised to a given power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math` is a built-in object that provides various mathematical constants and functions, whereas `Math.pow` is a specific method of the `Math` object that raises a value to a given power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a function that returns the value of the mathematical constant Pi, whereas `Math.pow` raises a value to a given power.

DONE.
