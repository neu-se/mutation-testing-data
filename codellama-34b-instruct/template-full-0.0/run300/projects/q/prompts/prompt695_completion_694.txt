  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would return a function that always returns a rejected promise, instead of a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would return a function that always returns a rejected promise, instead of a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fbind` function would return a function that always returns a rejected promise, instead of a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the bound function.

DONE.
