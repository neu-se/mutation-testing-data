  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with a new element, the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map the `args` array to a new array where each element is incremented by 1, instead of passing the `args` array as is.

DONE.
