  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable, which is not defined in the context of the `then` method. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is resolved with the value `null`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the value of the `value` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable, which is not defined in the context of the `then` method. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the value of the `value` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
