  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first attribute of the last operation, rather than all attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the number of attributes of the last operation, rather than the actual attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first attribute of the last operation, rather than all attributes.

DONE.
