  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` will always return `true` when the `for` loop is executed, while the new code fragment `0` will always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` will always return `true` when the `for` loop is executed, while the new code fragment `-1` will always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` will always return `true` when the `for` loop is executed, while the new code fragment `NaN` will always return `false`.

DONE.
