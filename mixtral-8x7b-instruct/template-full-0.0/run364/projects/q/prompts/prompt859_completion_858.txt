 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be always resolved, even when an error occurs. The original code fragment rejects the promise in case of an error, which allows the error to be handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new empty function, which would be executed instead of rejecting the promise. This could lead to unexpected behavior, as errors would not be properly propagated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the promise itself, instead of rejecting it. This could lead to issues in the calling code, as it would not receive the error information.

DONE.
