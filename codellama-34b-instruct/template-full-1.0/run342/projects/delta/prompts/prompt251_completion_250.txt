  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to enter an infinite loop, as the `length` variable would never decrease.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<any>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to enter an infinite loop, as the `length` variable would never decrease.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to skip over the first `opLength` elements of `otherIter`, which could potentially cause the loop to never exit if `opLength` is greater than the length of `otherIter`.

DONE.
