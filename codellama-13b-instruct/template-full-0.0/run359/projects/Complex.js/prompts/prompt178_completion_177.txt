  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, whereas the original code fragment `Math.abs(c) < <PLACEHOLDER>(d)` compares the absolute value of `c` to the result of a function call with the name `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.max` function returns the larger of two numbers, whereas the original code fragment `Math.abs(c) < <PLACEHOLDER>(d)` compares the absolute value of `c` to the result of a function call with the name `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function returns the smaller of two numbers, whereas the original code fragment `Math.abs(c
