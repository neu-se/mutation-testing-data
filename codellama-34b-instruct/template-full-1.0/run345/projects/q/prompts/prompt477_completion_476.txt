  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` would make the `splice` method remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, instead of the element at the index `at`. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to untrack the wrong rejection, potentially causing unhandled rejections to not be properly reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would make the `splice` method remove the element before the one at the index `at`, instead of the element at the index `at`. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to untrack the wrong rejection, potentially causing unhandled rejections to not be properly reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 2` would make the `splice` method remove the element
