  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will not break the loop when the callback function returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === true
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will break the loop when the callback function returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== true
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will not break the loop when the callback function returns `true`.

DONE.
