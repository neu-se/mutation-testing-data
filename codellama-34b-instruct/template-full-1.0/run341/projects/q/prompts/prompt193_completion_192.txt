  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3 && attempt3[1] && attempt3[2];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `attempt3` is truthy, rather than returning an array with the matched values from `attempt3`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return attempt3.test(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `attempt3` matches `stackLine`, rather than returning the matched values from `attempt3`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return stackLine.includes(attempt3);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `stackLine` includes `attempt3`, rather than returning the matched values from `attempt3`.

DONE.
