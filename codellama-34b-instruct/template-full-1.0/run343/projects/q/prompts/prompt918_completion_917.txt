  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reverse` method to be called on the return value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is not a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().nonsensemethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a new function to be called on the return value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is not a valid function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() { throw new Error("mutated"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown when the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is called, which would not happen in the original code.

DONE.
