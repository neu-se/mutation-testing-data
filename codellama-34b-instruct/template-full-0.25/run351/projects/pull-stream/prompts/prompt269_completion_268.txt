  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, while `null` is a null value that does not have the same meaning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value, and does not have the same meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value that indicates the end of the stream, while `true` is a boolean value that indicates the opposite of `end`.

DONE.
