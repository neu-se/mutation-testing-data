  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is no longer defined on the `process` object, which could cause errors if any code relies on its existence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString = function() { return "foo"; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method now returns the string "foo" instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString = function() { throw new Error("bar"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method now throws an error with the message "bar" instead of the original value.

DONE.
