 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
longitude === -180 || longitude === 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for exact values of -180 and 180, allowing any other value between -180 and 180 to pass the validation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
longitude < -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows any longitude value greater than or equal to 180, which is not valid in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(longitude) > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for absolute longitude values greater than 180, allowing negative longitude values greater than -180 to pass the validation.

DONE.
