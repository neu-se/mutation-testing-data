  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `unique` function, so the `nonUnique` function would now pass through items that were previously filtered out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is now being called with a different argument, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is now being called with an additional argument, which could cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
