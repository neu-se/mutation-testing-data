  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because retaining a value would not push it to the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because deleting a value would not push it to the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because pushing a retain operation with a non-zero length would change the output.

DONE.
