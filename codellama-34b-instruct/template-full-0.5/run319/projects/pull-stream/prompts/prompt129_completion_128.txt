  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while this replacement calls it with `i` as the second argument. This change would cause the callback function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling the `cb` function, while this replacement increments `i` after calling the `cb` function. This change would cause the callback function to be called with a different value of `i`, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `i` as the second argument, while this replacement
