  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the complement of the angle, instead of the angle itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acot
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the arctangent of the inverse of the angle, instead of the arctangent of the angle itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acsc
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the hyperbolic cosecant of the angle, instead of the arctangent.

DONE.
