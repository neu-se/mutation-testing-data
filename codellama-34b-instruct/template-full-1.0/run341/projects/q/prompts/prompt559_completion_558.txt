  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isStopIteration(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the exception is a `StopIteration` object, while this proposed replacement uses the not ! operator to check if the exception is not a `StopIteration` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the exception is a `StopIteration` object, while this proposed replacement uses the not ! operator to check if the `StopIteration` object does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the exception is a `StopIteration` object, while this proposed replacement creates a new object using the `StopIteration` constructor and checks if the exception is that new object.

DONE.
