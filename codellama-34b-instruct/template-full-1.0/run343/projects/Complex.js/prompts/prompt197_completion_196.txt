  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary component of the complex number, which is not the same as the real component that the original code fragment returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary components of the complex number, which is not the same as the real component that the original code fragment returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary components of the complex number, which is not the same as the real component that the original code fragment returns.

DONE.
