  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is never called, which could cause issues if it is expected to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is called with `undefined` as an argument, which could cause issues if it is expected to be called with a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is called with a no-op function as an argument, which could cause issues if it is expected to be called with a function that performs a specific action.

DONE.
