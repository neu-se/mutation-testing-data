  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only advance the iterator by one element, rather than by the entire length of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one less than the entire length of the current op, which could result in the iterator not being advanced far enough.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one more than the entire length of the current op, which could result in the iterator being advanced too far.

DONE.
