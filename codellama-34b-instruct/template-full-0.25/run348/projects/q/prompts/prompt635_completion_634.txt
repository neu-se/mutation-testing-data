  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw a `TypeError` instead of a `QReturnValue` error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw a `TypeError` instead of a `QReturnValue` error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw a `TypeError` instead of a `QReturnValue` error.

DONE.
