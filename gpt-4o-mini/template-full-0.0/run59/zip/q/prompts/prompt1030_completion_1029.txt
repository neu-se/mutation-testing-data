Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the nodeback to receive `undefined` as the first argument instead of the resolved value, which could lead to unexpected results in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the resolved value by incrementing it by 1, which changes the output of the promise resolution and could lead to incorrect results in the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("An error occurred")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately throw an error instead of passing the resolved value to the nodeback, causing the callback to receive an error instead of the expected result.

DONE.
