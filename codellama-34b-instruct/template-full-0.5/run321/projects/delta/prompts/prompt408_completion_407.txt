  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(0)` would retain zero characters, whereas `delta.chop()` would retain all characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Math.random() * delta.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(Math.random() * delta.length)` would retain a random number of characters, whereas `delta.chop()` would retain all characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete(0)` would delete zero characters, whereas `delta.chop()` would retain all characters.

DONE.
