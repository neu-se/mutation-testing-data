 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` always returns a resolved promise, while the original code may return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy!') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an error that would not be present in the original code, potentially causing tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` always returns a rejected promise, while the original code may return a resolved promise.

DONE.
