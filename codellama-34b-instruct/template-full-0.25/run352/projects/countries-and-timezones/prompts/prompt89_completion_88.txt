  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` option, causing the function to return the opposite of what it would normally return.

DONE.
