  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.forEach(cb => cb());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the first callback in the `cbs` array, while this new code fragment calls all callbacks in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls all callbacks in the `cbs` array, while this new code fragment only calls the last callback in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls all callbacks in the `cbs` array, while this new code fragment only calls the first callback in the array.

DONE.
