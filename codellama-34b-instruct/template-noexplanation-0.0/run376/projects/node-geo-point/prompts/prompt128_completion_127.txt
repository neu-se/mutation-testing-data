  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This change swaps the longitude and latitude values, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + point.latitude
```
This change adds the latitude values of `this` and `point`, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + point.longitude
```
This change adds the longitude values of `this` and `point`, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

DONE.
