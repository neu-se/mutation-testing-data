  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only catch rejections, not fulfillments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only catch fulfillments, not rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would catch both fulfillments and rejections, but the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` functions would be called with different arguments than the original code.

DONE.
