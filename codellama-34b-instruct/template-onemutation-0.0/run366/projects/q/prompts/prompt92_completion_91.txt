  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments.length` is equal to 1, while the new code fragment checks if it is less than 1. This would cause the `array_reduce` function to behave differently when the `arguments.length` is 0 or negative.

DONE.
