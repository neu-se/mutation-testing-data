  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object's own properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object's own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs of an object's own properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object's own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` checks whether an object has a specified property as a direct property of that object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object's own properties.

DONE.
