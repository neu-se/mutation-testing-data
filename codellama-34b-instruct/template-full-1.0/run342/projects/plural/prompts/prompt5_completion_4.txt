  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `Object.prototype.toString.call` function to `Object`, which changes the `this` context of the function when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.apply(Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `Object.prototype.toString.call` function to `Object`, which changes the `this` context of the function when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype.call.bind(Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `Function.prototype.call` function to `Object`, which changes the `this` context of the function when it is called.

DONE.
