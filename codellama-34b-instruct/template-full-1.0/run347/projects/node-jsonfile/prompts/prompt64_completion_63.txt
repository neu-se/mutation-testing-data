  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method uses a different encoding scheme than `'utf8'` and `'\n'` may not be valid in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method uses a different encoding scheme than `'utf8'` and `'\n'` may not be valid in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16le'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method uses a different encoding scheme than `'utf8'` and `'\n'` may not be valid in all cases.

Done.
