  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `throw` argument, which would cause the function to throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `next` argument, which would cause the function to return a promise for the next value in the generator instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "return")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with the `return` argument, which would cause the function to return a promise for the return value of the generator instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
