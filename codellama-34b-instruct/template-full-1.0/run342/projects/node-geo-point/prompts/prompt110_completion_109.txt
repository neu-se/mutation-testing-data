  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` and `Math.log10` give different values for the same input. For example, `Math.log(10)` would give 2.302585092994046, while `Math.log10(10)` would give 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` give different values for the same input. For example, `Math.cos(Math.PI)` would give -1, while `Math.sin(Math.PI)` would give 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x, y) => x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function is a curried function that takes two arguments, while this replacement function is not curried and takes only
