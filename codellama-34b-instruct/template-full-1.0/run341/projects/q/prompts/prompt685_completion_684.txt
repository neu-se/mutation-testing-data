  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, so `array_slice()` would return an empty array, causing the function to be called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, so `array_slice()` would return an empty array, causing the function to be called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[void 0]` is an array with a single element, which is `undefined`. This would cause the function to be called with one argument, which is `undefined`.

DONE.
