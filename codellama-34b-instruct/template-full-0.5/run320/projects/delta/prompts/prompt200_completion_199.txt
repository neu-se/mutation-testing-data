  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest(0)` would return the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment `thisIter.rest(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the remaining ops after the placeholder has been processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(0)` would return the next op in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment `otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the next op after the placeholder has been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength() - 1` would return the length of the peeked op minus 1, whereas the original code fragment `thisIter.peekLength
