Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks for the presence of the substring 'https' anywhere in the URL, rather than ensuring that the URL starts with 'https', which could lead to incorrect protocol handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows both 'http' and 'https' URLs to be processed by the `http` request, potentially leading to security issues when handling secure connections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes whitespace from the end of the string instead of the beginning, which could cause the check to fail if there are leading spaces in the URL.

DONE.
