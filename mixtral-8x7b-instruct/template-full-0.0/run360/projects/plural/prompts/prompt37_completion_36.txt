 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of rules will be reversed, and the first matching rule will be applied. The original code uses `unshift` to add rules at the beginning of the array, ensuring that the first matching rule is applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the first rule will be removed, and the remaining rules will be shifted to the left. This could lead to some words not being pluralized correctly if the removed rule was responsible for their pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because all rules will be removed, and no words will be pluralized. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
