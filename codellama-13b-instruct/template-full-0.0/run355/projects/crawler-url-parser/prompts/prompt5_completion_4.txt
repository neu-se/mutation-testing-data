  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is a string that represents the URL to be parsed. This would cause the function to check if the URL contains any illegal characters, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the URL contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is called with the `baseUrlStr` argument, which is a string that represents the base URL to be used for parsing the URL. This would cause the function to check if the base URL contains any illegal characters, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the base URL contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars
