 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always receive `false` as its second argument, regardless of the original value. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly if it relies on the second argument being `null` to indicate the end of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive an error object instead of a boolean value. This could cause the function to throw an error and terminate the stream prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always receive a function as its second argument, which would always return `true`. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly if it relies on the second argument being `null` to indicate the end of the stream.

DONE.
