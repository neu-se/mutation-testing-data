  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src".substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method returns a new string, starting at the specified index. In this case, it would return the string starting from the second character, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property returns the number of characters in the string, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace("src", "dst")
```
This would result in different behavior because the replace method returns a new string with all occurrences of the first argument replaced with the second argument. In this case, it would replace all occurrences of "src" with "dst", which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
