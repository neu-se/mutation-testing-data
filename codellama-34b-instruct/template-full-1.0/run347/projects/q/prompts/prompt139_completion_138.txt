  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var p = promise.source; p && p !== promise; p = p.source) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the loop condition to `p && p !== promise`, which would cause the loop to terminate earlier if `p` is `null` or `undefined`, regardless of whether `p` is equal to `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var p = promise.source; p && p !== promise; p = p.source) {
    if (p.stack) {
        stacks.unshift(p.stack);
    }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional check for `p.stack` before unshifting it onto the `stacks` array, which could potentially skip some stack frames that do not have a `stack` property defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
