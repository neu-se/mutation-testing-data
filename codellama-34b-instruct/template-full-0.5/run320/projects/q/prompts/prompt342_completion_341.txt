  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `reject` with a different argument, `new Error(exception)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `reject` with a different argument, `exception`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `reject` with a different argument, `exception`, and the `message` property of the `exception` object would be used as the rejection reason.

DONE.
