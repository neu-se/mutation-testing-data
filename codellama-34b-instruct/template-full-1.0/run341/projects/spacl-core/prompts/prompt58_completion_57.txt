  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\' + $1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'$$1'` is a way to escape the `$` character in a string, but the new code fragment `'\\' + $1'` would not produce the same result, as it would concatenate the string `'\\'` with the value of the variable `$1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$1.replace('$', '$$')'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'\\$1'` is a way to escape the `$` character in a string, but the new code fragment `$1.replace('$', '$$')` would not produce the same result, as it would replace the `$` character in the string with the value of the variable `$1`, and then escape the `$` character again with another `$`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' життя'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `'
