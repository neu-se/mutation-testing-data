  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `error` is not undefined or null and is a string, while the new code fragment checks if `error` is defined and is a string. If `error` is undefined or null, the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`.
