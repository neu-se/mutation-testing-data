  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `_read` function with `true` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment would only call it with `true` if `err` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment would only call it with `null` if `err` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ream(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err, data)
  } else {
    cb(null, data)
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `ream` function with `null` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment would
