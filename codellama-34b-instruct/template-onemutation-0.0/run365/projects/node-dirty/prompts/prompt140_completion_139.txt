  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an `'error'` event with the `err` object as an argument, while the modified code fragment emits an `'error'` event with the `err` object as the only argument, which is not the same as the original behavior.

DONE.
