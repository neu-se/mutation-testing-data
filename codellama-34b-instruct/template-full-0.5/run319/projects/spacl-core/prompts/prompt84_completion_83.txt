  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value by iterating over the elements of the original array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` returns the original array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array.

DONE.
