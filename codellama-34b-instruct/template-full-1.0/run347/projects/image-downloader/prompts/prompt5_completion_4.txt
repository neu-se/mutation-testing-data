  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method returns a resolved promise with the given value, whereas the `reject` method returns a rejected promise with the given reason. In this case, if the `dest` property is not provided, the `request` function would still be called with an invalid `dest` value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will raise an error, whereas `return` will return a rejected promise. In this case, if the `dest` property is not provided, the `request` function would not be called at all, and the error would propagate up the call stack.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` with a value of `undefined` would not return a rejected promise, but would instead return `undefined`. In this case, if
