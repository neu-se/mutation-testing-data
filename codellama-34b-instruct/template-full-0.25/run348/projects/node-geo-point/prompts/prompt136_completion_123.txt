  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different value, potentially causing the `toFixed` method to round the number differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different value, potentially causing the `toFixed` method to round the number differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function would be called with a different value, potentially causing the `toFixed` method to round the number differently.

DONE.
