  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` which includes all the arguments passed to the function, but the replaced code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)` which only includes the first two arguments and not the rest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` which returns the array of arguments in their original order, but the replaced code fragment uses `array_reverse(arguments)` which returns the array of arguments in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(Object.values(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` which includes all the arguments passed to the function, but the replaced code fragment uses `array_slice(Object.values(arguments))` which
