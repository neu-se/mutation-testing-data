  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = this['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the `asinh` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] = -this['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the real part of the complex number, which would cause the `acosh` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = -this['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the imaginary part of the complex number, which would cause the `atanh` function to return a different result.

DONE.
