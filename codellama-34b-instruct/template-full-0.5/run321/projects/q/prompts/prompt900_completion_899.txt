  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses to call the `makeNodeResolver` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `makeNodeResolver` method to create a function that would resolve the promise, while this replacement would simply return the `resolve` method of the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `makeNodeResolver` method to create a function that would resolve the promise, while this replacement would simply return the `reject` method of the `deferred` object.

DONE.
