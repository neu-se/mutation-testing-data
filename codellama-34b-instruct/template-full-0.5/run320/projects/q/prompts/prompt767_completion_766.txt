  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("Rejected promise");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not throw an error, while this code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "Fulfilled promise";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not return a value, while this code fragment returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return Q.reject("Rejected promise");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `noop` does not return a rejected promise, while this code fragment returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
