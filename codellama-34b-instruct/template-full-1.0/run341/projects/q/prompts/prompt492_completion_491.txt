  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function expects a `promise` argument, and passing `rejection` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection.promise` is not defined, and passing it as an argument to `untrackRejection` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` expects a `promise` argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
