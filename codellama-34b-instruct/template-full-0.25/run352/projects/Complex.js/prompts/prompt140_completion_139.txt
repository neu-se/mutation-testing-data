  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` function to return `Complex['NAN']` when the base is infinite and the exponent is zero, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` function to return `Complex['NAN']` when both the base and the exponent are infinite or zero, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` in the first case and `Complex['ZERO']` in the second case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
