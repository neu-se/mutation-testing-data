 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be immediately rejected instead of being passed to the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Replacement error')
