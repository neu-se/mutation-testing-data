  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let index = 0; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` keyword is used instead of `var`, which would cause the variable `index` to be block-scoped instead of function-scoped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var index = 0; index < length; index++) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `var` keyword is used instead of `let`, which would cause the variable `index` to be function-scoped instead of block-scoped.

DONE.
