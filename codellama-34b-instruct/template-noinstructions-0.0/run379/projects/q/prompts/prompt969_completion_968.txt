  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `npost` method on the `Q` object, which is not the same as calling the `npost` method on the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `npost` method on the `Q` object with the `name` and `args` arguments, which is not the same as calling the `npost` method on the `object` itself with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.npost(name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `npost` method on the `object` itself with the `name` and `args` arguments, which is not the same as calling the `npost` method on the `Q` object with the same arguments
