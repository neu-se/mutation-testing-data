  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`, while `a + 1` returns the value of `a` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`, while `b` returns the value of the variable `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of the variable `a`, while `a * b` returns the value of `a` multiplied by the value of `b`.

DONE.
