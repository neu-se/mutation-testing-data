Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` function to compare `x` with `x`, which will always be true, leading to a promise that resolves to `x` regardless of the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` function to compare `x` with `null`, which would only resolve if `x` is `null`, potentially leading to unexpected rejections for any other value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` function to compare `x` with `undefined`, which would only resolve if `x` is `undefined`, leading to a promise that resolves only under that specific condition.

DONE.
