  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(text == null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `||` operator instead of the `==` operator. With `==`, the test will return `true` if `text` is `null`, but with `===`, the test will only return `true` if `text` is both `null` and a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(text && /\S/.test(text))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression to test for the presence of any non-whitespace character in the `text` string, while this code segment uses the `&&` operator to test for both the presence of the string and the absence of whitespace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(text == null ? "" : text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `??` operator to return an empty string if `text` is `null`, but
