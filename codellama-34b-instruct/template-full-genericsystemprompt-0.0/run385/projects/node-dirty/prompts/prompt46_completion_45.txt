  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different value than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different value than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key) * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with a different value than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
