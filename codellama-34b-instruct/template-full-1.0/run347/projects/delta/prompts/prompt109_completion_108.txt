  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<Op>.length < <elem>.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `length` property of `elem` in the comparison, instead of using the value of the `retain` property of `elem` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((<Op>.length < <elem>.retain) || (<elem>.attributed == null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `length` property of `elem` in the comparison if the `attributed` property of `elem` is null, instead of always using the value of the `retain` property of `elem` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((<Op>.length < <elem>.retain) && (<elem>.attributed != null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `length` property of `elem`
