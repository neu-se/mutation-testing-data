  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called even if there are still pending promises, rather than only when all promises have been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called as soon as any promise is rejected, rather than only when all promises have been rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` function to be called as soon as any promise is rejected, rather than only when all promises have been rejected.

DONE.
