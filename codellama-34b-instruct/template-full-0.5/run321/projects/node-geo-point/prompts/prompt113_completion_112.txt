  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 179
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by 179 instead of 180 would result in a slightly different angle, which could cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be off by a small amount.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 181
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by 181 instead of 180 would result in a slightly different angle, which could cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be off by a small amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 0.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 0.00001 to the result of the division would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be off by a small amount.

DONE
