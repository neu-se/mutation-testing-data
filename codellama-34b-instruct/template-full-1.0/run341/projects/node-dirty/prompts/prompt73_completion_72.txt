  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the 'ENOENT' error code, but the modified version also checks for the 'ENOTDIR' error code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message === 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the error code, but the modified version checks for the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the 'ENOENT' error code, but the modified version checks for a different error code ('EISDIR').

DONE.
