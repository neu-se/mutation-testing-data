  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromPromise` method returns a promise, while the `fromCallback` method returns a callback. The `fromCallback` method would cause the code to execute synchronously, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromPromise` method returns a promise, while the `fromCallback` method returns a callback. The `fromPromise` method would cause the code to execute asynchronously, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromCallback` method returns a callback, while the `fromPromise` method returns a promise. The `fromCallback` method would cause the code to execute synchronously, which could have unintended consequences.

DONE.
