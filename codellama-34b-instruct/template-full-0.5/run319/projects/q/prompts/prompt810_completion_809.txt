  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the given value or promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the given value or promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise for the given value or promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the given value or promise.

DONE.
