 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `false` or `null` even if the policy exists in the map, as the `policy.query(path, verb, ctx)` line would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
