  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` is a number, while `otherData` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData[0]` is the first element of the `otherData` array, while `otherData` is the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.slice(1)` is the `otherData` array without its first element, while `otherData` is the entire array.

DONE.
