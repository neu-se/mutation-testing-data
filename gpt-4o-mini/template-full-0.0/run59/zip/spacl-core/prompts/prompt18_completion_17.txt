Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the original `spec`, potentially altering the regex compilation and leading to incorrect path matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/:/g, '-')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of ':' in `spec` with '-', which could change the intended path structure and lead to malformed captures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire `spec` string to uppercase, which may not match the expected case-sensitive paths, resulting in incorrect regex generation.

DONE.
