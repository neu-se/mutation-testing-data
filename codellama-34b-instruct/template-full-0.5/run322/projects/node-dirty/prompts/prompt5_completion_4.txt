  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the key `null` from the `_data` map, rather than the intended key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the key `undefined` from the `_data` map, rather than the intended key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the key `''` (empty string) from the `_data` map, rather than the intended key.

DONE.
