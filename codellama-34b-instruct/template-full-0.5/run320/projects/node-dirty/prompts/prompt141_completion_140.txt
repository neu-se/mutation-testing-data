  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'done'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'done' is not an error event, and the code would not handle it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'close' is not an error event, and the code would not handle it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drain' is not an error event, and the code would not handle it correctly.

DONE.
