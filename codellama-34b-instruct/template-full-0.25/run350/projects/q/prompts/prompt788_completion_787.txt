  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the original value of `object` to the `Q` function, while the new code fragment would pass `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the original value of `object` to the `Q` function, while the new code fragment would pass `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the original value of `object` to the `Q` function, while the new code fragment would pass `0`.

DONE.
