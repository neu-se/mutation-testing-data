  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.encoding` property is now being passed as the second argument to the `stringify` function, which would cause the JSON string to be encoded differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` property is now being passed as the second argument to the `stringify` function, which would cause the JSON string to be revivered differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.replacer` property is now being passed as the second argument to the `stringify` function, which would cause the JSON string to be replaced differently.

DONE.
