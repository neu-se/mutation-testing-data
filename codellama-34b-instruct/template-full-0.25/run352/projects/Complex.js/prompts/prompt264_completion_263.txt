  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the natural logarithm of `a` instead of `b`, which is the intended input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the input `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the input `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
