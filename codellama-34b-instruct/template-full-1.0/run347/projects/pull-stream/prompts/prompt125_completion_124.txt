  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `end` variable, which is used to determine whether the function should return a value or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `end` variable, which is used to determine whether the function should return a value or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end > max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for returning a value, it would invert the condition.

DONE.
