  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>{otherIter.peekLength()} + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the peeked length of `other`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for one more iteration than it should. This could potentially cause an infinite loop, depending on the inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>{otherIter.peekLength()} - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the peeked length of `other`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` for one more iteration than it should. This could potentially cause the loop to terminate too early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>{otherIter.peekLength()} * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the peek
