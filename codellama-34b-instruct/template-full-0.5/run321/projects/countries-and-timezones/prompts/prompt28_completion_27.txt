  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds a number down to the nearest integer. This could cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return incorrect offset values, which could in turn cause errors in the `buildTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` round a number to the nearest integer. This could cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return incorrect offset values, which could in turn cause errors in the `buildTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior
