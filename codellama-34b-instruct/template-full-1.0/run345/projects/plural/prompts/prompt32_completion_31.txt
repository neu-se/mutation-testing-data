  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length - 3` would create a different substring than the original `w.length - 2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'is' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` would exclude the last letter of the word, and `'is'` would be added instead of `'es'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring
