  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` returns a new promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise, while the original code fragment returned the original promise without any modification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` returns a new promise that resolves with the `noop` function, while the original code fragment returned the original promise without any modification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` returns a new promise that rejects with the `noop` function, while the original code fragment returned the original promise without any modification.

DONE.
