  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, leading to a different execution path in the `fail` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback will be called with a different argument, leading to a different execution path in the `fail` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback will be called with a different argument, leading to a different execution path in the `fail` function.

DONE.
