  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ses` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ses` is not an object, while this replacement checks if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ses` is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is not defined.

DONE.
