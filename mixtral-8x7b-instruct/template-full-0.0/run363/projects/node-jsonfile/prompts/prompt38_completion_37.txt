 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `fs` module's `writeFile` method instead of the universalified version, which may not work as expected in different environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `fromPromise` method to create a promised-based version of the `fs.writeFile` method, which may not be compatible with the existing code that expects a callback-based function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('fs').writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `fs` module directly, without considering the possibility of using a different implementation of the `writeFile` method. This may cause issues if the code is intended to run in a different environment that does not support the Node.js `fs` module.

DONE.
