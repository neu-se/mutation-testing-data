  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` call would be unconditional, whereas in the original code, it was only called if the `timeout` argument was not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` call would be unconditional, whereas in the original code, it was only called if the `timeout` argument was provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` call would be unconditional, whereas in the original code, it was only called if the `timeout` argument was provided.

DONE.
