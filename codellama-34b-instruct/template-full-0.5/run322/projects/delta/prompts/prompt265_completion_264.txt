  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `delete`, and would result in a different transformation of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `delete`, and would result in a different transformation of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` is a different method than `delete`, and would result in a different transformation of the delta.

DONE.
