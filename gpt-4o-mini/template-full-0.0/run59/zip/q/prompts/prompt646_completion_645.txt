Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, args, "extraArg"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which may cause the method being invoked to behave differently or throw an error if it does not expect more than the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invoke(name, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from `dispatch` to `invoke`, which may not be defined or may have different logic, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `args` parameter, potentially causing the method being invoked to receive fewer arguments than expected, which could lead to incorrect behavior or runtime errors.

DONE.
