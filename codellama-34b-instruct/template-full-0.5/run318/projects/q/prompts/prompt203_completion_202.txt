  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation operator in JavaScript is `+`, not `@`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator in JavaScript is `%`, not `@`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"&"
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator in JavaScript is `&`, not `@`.

DONE.
