```
plus + minus === 1
```
This change will cause the code to always enter the `if` block, even if the `plus` and `minus` variables are equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 2
```
This change will cause the code to never enter the `if` block, even if the `plus` and `minus` variables are equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 3
```
This change will cause the code to always enter the `if` block, even if the `plus` and `minus` variables are equal to 0.

DONE.
