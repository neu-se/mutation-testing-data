  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `end, null` passes `null` instead. This could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `data` value being passed to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` value to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `end, undefined` passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the test suite to fail if it relies on the `data` value being passed to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` value to the `cb`
