  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `attr` object at the specified `key`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of the `attr` object at the specified `key` if it exists, and `undefined` otherwise. This change would cause the `transform` function to return `undefined` if the `attr` object does not have a property at the specified `key`, which could potentially break the code that relies on the `transform` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `attr` object at the specified `key`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of the `attr` object at the specified `key` if it exists, and `null` otherwise. This change would cause the `transform` function to return `null` if the `attr` object does not have a property at the specified `key`, which could potentially break the
