  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This code fragment is a simple replacement for the original `!cbed` and has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed || abort
```
This code fragment is a more complex replacement for the original `!cbed` and has different behavior. It checks if `cbed` is not true or if `abort` is true, and if so, it sets `loop` to false and returns. This change can cause the function to exit early if `abort` is true, even if `cbed` is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed && !abort
```
This code fragment is a more complex replacement for the original `!cbed` and has different behavior. It checks if `cbed` is true and `abort` is false, and if so, it sets `loop` to false and returns. This change can cause the function to exit early if `cbed` is
