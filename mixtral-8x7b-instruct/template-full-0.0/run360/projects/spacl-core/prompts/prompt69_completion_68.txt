 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['query']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `query` method using bracket notation instead of dot notation, which can lead to issues if the `query` property is not defined or is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx || {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to provide a default value for the `ctx` parameter. This can cause issues if the `ctx` parameter is intentionally set to `null` or `undefined` in the tests, as the default value would be used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query.bind(rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `bind` method to create a new function with the `rule` object as its `this` context. This can cause issues if the original `query` method relies on
