  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to the real part of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to a different value than the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be applied to the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, instead of just the imaginary part.

DONE.
