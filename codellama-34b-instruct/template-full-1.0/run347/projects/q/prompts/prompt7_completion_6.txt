  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function definition without passing any arguments, which could cause an error if the function expects arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
someOtherFunction()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function, potentially causing the code to behave in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the function definition with the value null, which could cause an error if the function is expected to return a value.

DONE.
