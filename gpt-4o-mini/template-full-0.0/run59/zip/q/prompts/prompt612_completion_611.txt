Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "unexpected"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an unexpected string to the array, which may cause the dispatch method to fail or behave incorrectly when trying to access the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` instead of the expected key, which may lead to an attempt to access a property with a null key, resulting in an error or undefined behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + "extra"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the key by appending the string "extra", which would cause the dispatch to look for a property that does not exist, leading to potential errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
