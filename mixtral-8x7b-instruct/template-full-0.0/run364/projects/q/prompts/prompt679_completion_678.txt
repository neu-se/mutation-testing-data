 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apPLY"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison for the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the function to not execute as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"applyFn"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not find a matching case for `"applyFn"`, causing the function to not execute as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.apply` would refer to the `apply` method of the current object, which may not be the same as the global `apply` function. This could cause the function to not execute as intended.

DONE.
