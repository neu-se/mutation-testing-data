  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer();
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = next.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.promise` property is not defined, causing the `ends.resolve` method to be called with an undefined value, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer();
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
ends.resolve = next.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.resolve` method is being called with a rejected promise, which would likely cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer();
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail:
