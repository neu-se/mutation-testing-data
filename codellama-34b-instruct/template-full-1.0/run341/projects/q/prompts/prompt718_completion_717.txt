  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch("keys", []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array instead of the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch("keys", null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null instead of the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch("keys", [1, 2, 3]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the array [1, 2, 3] instead of the keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
