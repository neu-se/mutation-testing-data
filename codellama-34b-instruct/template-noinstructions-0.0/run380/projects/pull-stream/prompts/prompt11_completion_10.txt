  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, potentially causing the loop to skip over elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random index in the array, potentially causing the loop to skip over elements or repeat elements.

DONE.
