  Sure, I can provide you with three options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` in the `calculateDestination` function with a buggy code fragment. Here are my suggestions:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
位2 = 位1 + 2 * Math.PI * distance / radius;
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression on the right-hand side of the assignment operator is not the same as the one in the original code. In the original code, the `distance` variable is divided by `radius` to compute the angular distance in radians, while in the modified code, the `distance` variable is multiplied by `2 * Math.PI` to compute the angular distance in degrees.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
位2 = 位1 + distance / radius;
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression on the right-hand side of the assignment operator is not the same as the one in the original code. In the original code, the `distance` variable is divided by
