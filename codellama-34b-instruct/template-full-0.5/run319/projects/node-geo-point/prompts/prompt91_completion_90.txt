  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle θ would be shifted by 180 degrees, which would change the direction of the bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle θ would be doubled, which would change the direction of the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle θ would be shifted by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which would also change the direction of the bearing calculation.

DONE.
