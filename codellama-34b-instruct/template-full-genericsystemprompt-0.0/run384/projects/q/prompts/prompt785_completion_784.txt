  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with the `promise` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `promise` object as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected with an `Error` object as the reason, rather than the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would be called with the `promise` object as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `promise` object as the reason.

DONE.
