  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the sum of the `plus` and `minus` variables is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if the sum is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the sum of the `plus` and `minus` variables is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if the difference between the `plus` and `minus` variables is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the sum of the `plus` and `minus` variables is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if the sum is equal to one.

DONE.
