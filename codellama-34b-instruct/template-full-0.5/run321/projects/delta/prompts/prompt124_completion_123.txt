  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.hasNext()` checks if the iterator has a next element, while `iter.hasNext` is a reference to the `hasNext` method of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` advances the iterator to the next element, while `iter.hasNext` does not affect the iterator's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, while `iter.hasNext` does not return any value.

DONE.
