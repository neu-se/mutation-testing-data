  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return the last character of the input string (w.length - 1) instead of the first character (0).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the length of the input string instead of the substring starting at the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the substring starting at the last character of the input string instead of the first character.

DONE.
