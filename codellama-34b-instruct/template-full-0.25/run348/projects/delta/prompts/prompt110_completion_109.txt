  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different value than `op`, and the code that uses `op` may have different behavior when `op.insert` is used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different value than `op`, and the code that uses `op` may have different behavior when `op.retain` is used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different value than `op`, and the code that uses `op` may have different behavior when `op.delete` is used instead.

DONE.
