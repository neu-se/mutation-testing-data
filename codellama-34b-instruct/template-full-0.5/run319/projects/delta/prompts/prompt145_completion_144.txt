  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value onto the ops array, which would likely cause an error when the code attempts to use the value later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an undefined value onto the ops array, which would likely cause an error when the code attempts to use the value later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(ops.pop());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the last value from the ops array onto the end of the array, which would likely cause an infinite loop when the code attempts to iterate over the array.

DONE.
