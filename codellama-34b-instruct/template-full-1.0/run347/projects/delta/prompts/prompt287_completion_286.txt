  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is in the beginning of the array, but the modified code fragment checks if the index is greater than 0, which means it is in the middle or the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is in the beginning of the array, but the modified code fragment checks if the index is equal to 1, which means it is the second element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is in the beginning of the array, but the modified code fragment sets the index to 0, which means it points to the first
