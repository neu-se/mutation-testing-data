  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic of the `if` statement. The original code fragment checks if `max` is greater than 0 or if `any` is true, while the new code fragment checks if both `max` is greater than 0 and `any` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 1 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic of the `if` statement. The original code fragment checks if `max` is greater than 0 or if `any` is true, while the new code fragment checks if `max` is greater than 1 or if `any` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic of the `if` statement. The original code fragment checks if `max` is greater than 0 or if
