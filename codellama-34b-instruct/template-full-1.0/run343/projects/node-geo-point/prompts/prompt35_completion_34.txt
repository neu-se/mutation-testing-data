  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the `point2Rad` variable instead of `point1Rad`, which could potentially cause issues if the value of `point2Rad` is not consistent with the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the value of `point1Rad` by 2, which could potentially cause issues if the value of `point1Rad` is not consistent with the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 10 to the value of `point1Rad`, which could potentially cause issues if the value of `point1Rad` is not consistent with the expected value.

DONE.
