  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitudes of the two points instead of using the latitude of the first point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2 - point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the complement of the latitude of the first point instead of the latitude itself.

DONE.
