  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is the negation of `done`, so the code inside the `if` block would be executed even if `done` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done && false` is equivalent to `done` and `false`, so the code inside the `if` block would not be executed if `done` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `done || true` is equivalent to `done` and `true`, so the code inside the `if` block would be executed if `done` is true.

DONE.
