  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` would be incremented by one less than the length of the current operation, which could cause the `while` loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` would be incremented by one more than the length of the current operation, which could cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` would be incremented by twice the length of the current operation, which could cause the `while` loop to iterate twice as many times as necessary.

DONE.
