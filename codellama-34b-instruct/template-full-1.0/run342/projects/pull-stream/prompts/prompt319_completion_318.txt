  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is used to indicate that there are no more items to read, while `undefined` would indicate that the item is not available yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is used to indicate that there are no more items to read, while `false` would indicate that the item is not available yet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is used to indicate that there are no more items to read, while `true` would indicate that the item is available and should be read.

DONE.
