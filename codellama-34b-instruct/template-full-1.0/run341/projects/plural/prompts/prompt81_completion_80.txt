  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('clam', 'cls')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is 'goose', 'geese', which is a valid exception rule that adds a custom pluralization for the word 'geese' when the word 'goose' is encountered. However, the new code fragment 'clam', 'cls' is not a valid exception rule, as 'cls' is not a valid plural form for the word 'clam'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'gooses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is 'goose', 'geese', which is a valid exception rule that adds a custom pluralization for the word 'geese' when the word 'goose' is encountered. However, the new code fragment 'goose', 'gooses' is not a valid exception rule, as 'geese' is already the plural form for the word 'goose', and adding a new pluralization for 'goose'
