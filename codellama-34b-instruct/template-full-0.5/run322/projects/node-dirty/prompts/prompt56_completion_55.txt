  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method would be called on the write stream, causing it to close and flush any remaining data, whereas the original code fragment would call the `close()` method on the dirty database, which would close the read and write streams and emit the `drain` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method would remove all data from the in-memory cache, whereas the original code fragment would only remove the data associated with the key that was being set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method would remove all pending writes from the queue, whereas the original code fragment would only remove the writes associated with the key that was being set.

DONE.
