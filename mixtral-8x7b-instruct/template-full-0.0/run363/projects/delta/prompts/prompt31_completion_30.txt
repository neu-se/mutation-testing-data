 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` only returns enumerable and non-enumerable own properties, while `Object.keys` returns only enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.values(attr).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the values of the attributes, not the keys, when inverting the attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.entries(attr).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the array of key-value pairs instead of just keys, potentially changing the order of the keys in the resulting inverted attributes.

DONE.
