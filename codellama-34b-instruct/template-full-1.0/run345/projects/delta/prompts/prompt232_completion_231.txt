  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` property of `otherIter` is never zero, and the `else` branch is never taken when the `if` condition fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` function of `otherIter` always returns `true` if there are still elements in the iterator, and the `!otherIter.hasNext()` condition never evaluates to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType = 'none';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` function of `otherIter` always returns the type of the next element in the iterator, and the `if` condition would never evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
