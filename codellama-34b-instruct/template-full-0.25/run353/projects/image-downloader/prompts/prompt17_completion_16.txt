  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would change the case of the decoded basename, which could potentially cause the file to be saved with a different name than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` would return the basename of the `options.dest` path, which could be different from the decoded basename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` would return the directory name of the `options.dest` path, which could be different from the decoded basename.

DONE.
