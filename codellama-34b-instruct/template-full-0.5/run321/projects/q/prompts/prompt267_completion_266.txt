  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `reason` as its argument, causing the promise to be rejected with that reason, rather than being fulfilled with the value of `reason`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would be called with `reason` as its argument, causing the promise to be fulfilled with that reason, rather than being rejected with the value of `reason`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with `reason` as its argument, causing the promise to be resolved with that reason, rather than being rejected with the value of `reason`.

DONE.
