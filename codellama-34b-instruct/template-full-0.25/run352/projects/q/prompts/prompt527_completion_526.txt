  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as the `op` argument, instead of the `args` array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array without its first element as the `op` argument, instead of the `args` array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.concat(args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array concatenated with its first element as the `op` argument, instead of the `args` array itself.

DONE.
