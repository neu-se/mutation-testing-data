  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would also match URLs with a path component after the default file extension, whereas the original code fragment only matches URLs with a path component that ends with the default file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+\/[a-z]+\/[a-z]+\/[a-z]+$/

This would result in different behavior because it would also match URLs with three path components after the default file extension, whereas the original
