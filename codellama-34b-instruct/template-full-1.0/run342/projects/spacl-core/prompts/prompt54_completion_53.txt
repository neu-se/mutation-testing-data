  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
