Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.has(key)` checks if the key exists in the queue, returning a boolean instead of the list of callbacks, which would prevent the callbacks from being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.get(key).length` returns the number of callbacks associated with the key, which would not allow the code to push the callback into the array, potentially leading to a situation where the callback is never called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key) || null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of an empty array would cause a runtime error when trying to push the callback into `null`, leading to uncaught exceptions instead of simply ignoring the callback.

DONE.
