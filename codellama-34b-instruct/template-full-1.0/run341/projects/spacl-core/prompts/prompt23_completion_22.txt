  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a string, but `42` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a string, but `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a string, but `null` is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

DONE.
