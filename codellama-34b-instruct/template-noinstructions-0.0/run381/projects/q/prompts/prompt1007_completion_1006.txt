  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 1)` is a function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with the first element removed, whereas `array_slice` is a function that takes an array and a starting index as input and returns a new array with the elements from the starting index to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 0, 1)` is a function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with the first element removed, whereas `array_slice` is a function that takes an array and a starting index as input and returns a new array with the elements from the starting index to the end of the array.
