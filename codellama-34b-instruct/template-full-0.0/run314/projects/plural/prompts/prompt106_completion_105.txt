  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman," while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "woman" or "man."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "man" or "woman," while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "woman" or "man."
