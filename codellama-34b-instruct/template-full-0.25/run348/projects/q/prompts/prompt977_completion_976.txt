  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(null)` would return a deferred object with a null value, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with a null value instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(undefined)` would return a deferred object with an undefined value, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with an undefined value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, but `defer(true)` would return a deferred object with a true value, which could cause the promise chain to resolve with a true
