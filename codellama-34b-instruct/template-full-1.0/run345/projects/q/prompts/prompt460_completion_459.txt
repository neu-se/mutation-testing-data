  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because a negative value is not the same as the original value of -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because a positive value is not the same as the original value of -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of at would be different after adding 1.

Done.
