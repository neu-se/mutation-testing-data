  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isZero']()` is a method that checks if the complex number is zero, while `this['isInfinite']()` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isZero']()` is a method that checks if the complex number is zero, while `this['isInfinite']()` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['ZERO']` is a constant that represents the complex number zero, while `this['isInfinite']()` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
