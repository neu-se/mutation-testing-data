  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '1' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "1" to the destination filename, which would cause the file to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would specify the encoding of the file as UTF-8, which could cause the file to be written with a different encoding than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, flag: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would specify the flag as "w" (write), which would cause the file to be overwritten if it already exists, rather than appended to as in the original code.

DONE.
