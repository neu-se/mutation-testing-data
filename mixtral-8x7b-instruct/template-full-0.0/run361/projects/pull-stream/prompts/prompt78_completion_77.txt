 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function is replaced with a direct call to `read`, which may cause the function to terminate prematurely and not process all data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data) || read(abort || true, done || function () {})
