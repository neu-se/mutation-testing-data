Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, which in this case is the current context (`this`). This could potentially lead to issues if the `closeFile` method relies on its original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.closeFile(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new anonymous function that calls `closeFile` with the `file` argument, which could lead to issues if the original `closeFile` method was not intended to be called with an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, but in this case, it is not being called with any arguments, which would result in a TypeError when trying to call `closeFile` as a function.

DONE.
