  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, even if `true` is not passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `false` if `abort` is falsy, even if `false` is not passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is falsy, even if `true` is not passed as an argument.

DONE.
