  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` function would be called twice, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.reviver, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` function would be called three times, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` function would be called with `null` as the third argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
