 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error is thrown instead of using the provided `fulfilled` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would fail when trying to apply `null` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method expects a promise that resolves to an array, but here it receives an array directly, causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
