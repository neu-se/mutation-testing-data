  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because `i--` is not the same as `i++`, and it could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `i+1` is not the same as `i++`, and it could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
