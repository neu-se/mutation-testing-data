  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.atan2()` function to calculate the argument of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment adds the real and imaginary parts of the complex number without considering their relative magnitudes or directions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.atan2()` function to calculate the argument of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment subtracts the imaginary part from the real part without considering their relative magnitudes or directions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `Math.atan2()` function to calculate the argument of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment subtracts the real part from the imaginary part without considering their relative magnitudes or directions.

DONE.
