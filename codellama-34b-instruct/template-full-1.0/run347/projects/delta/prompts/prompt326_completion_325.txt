  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      (op.retain && op['attributes'] != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain all attributes, rather than only retaining the specified attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      (op['retain'] && !op['attributes'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain the specified attributes, rather than all attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
      (op['retain'] && op['attributes'] != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain the specified attributes, rather than all attributes.

DONE.
