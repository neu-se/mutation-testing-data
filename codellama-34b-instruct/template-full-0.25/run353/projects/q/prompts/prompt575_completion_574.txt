  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to `null` instead of the `generator` object, which would cause the `verb` argument to be `undefined` instead of `"next"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(generator, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to the `generator` object, but the `verb` argument would still be `"next"` instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(generator, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to the `generator` object and the `verb` argument would be `"throw"` instead of `"next"`.

DONE.
