  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `null` is a null value. If the `err` object is used as an argument in the `cb` function, it will be treated as an error and the function will return an error. However, if `null` is used as an argument, it will be treated as a valid value and the function will return a successful result.

DONE.
