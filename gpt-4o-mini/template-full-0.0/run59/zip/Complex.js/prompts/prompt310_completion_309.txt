Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from doubling the angle `a` to simply adding 1, which alters the trigonometric calculations and could lead to incorrect results for the secant function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the reference to the real part `a` with the imaginary part `b`, which fundamentally changes the angle used in the cosine calculation, leading to incorrect results for the secant function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the dynamic calculation of `2 * a` with a constant value of Ï€, which would yield a fixed angle for the secant function, resulting in incorrect and non-variable outputs.

DONE.
