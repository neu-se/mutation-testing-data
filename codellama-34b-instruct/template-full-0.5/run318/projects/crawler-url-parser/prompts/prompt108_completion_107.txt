  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple assignment, while the replaced code fragment is a method call with two regex replacements. The method call could potentially modify the value of `currentUrl`, leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol + "//" + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.pathname;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple assignment, while the replaced code fragment is a concatenation of multiple properties of the `currentUrl` object. The concatenation could potentially produce a different result than the original assignment, leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
