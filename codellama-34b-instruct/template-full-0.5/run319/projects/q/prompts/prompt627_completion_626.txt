  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a reserved keyword in JavaScript and using it as a property name would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setValue"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setValue" is a different property name than "set" and would not be recognized by the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set" + "Value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of "set" and "Value" would produce a different property name than "setValue".

DONE.
