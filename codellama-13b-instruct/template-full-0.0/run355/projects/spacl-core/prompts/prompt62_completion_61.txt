  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `reverse` modifies the original array and returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array concatenated with the elements of the argument, whereas `reverse` modifies the original array and returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the result of calling the provided function on each element of the original array, whereas `reverse` modifies the original array and returns `undefined`.

DONE.
