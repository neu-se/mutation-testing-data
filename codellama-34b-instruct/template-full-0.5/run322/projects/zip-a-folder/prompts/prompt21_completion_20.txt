  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"targetFilePath" + "buggy"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new file with the name "targetFilePathbuggy" instead of using the original file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new file with the name in uppercase letters instead of the original file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new file with the name without the first character of the original file name.

DONE.
