 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the current working directory instead of the module's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the current working directory, which might not be the same as the module's directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => path.resolve(process.cwd(), '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the parent directory of the current working directory, which might not be the same as the module's directory.

By introducing these changes, we can test whether the current test suite is able to catch the differences in behavior, which would indicate if the tests are effective in catching potential issues related to file path resolution. DONE.
