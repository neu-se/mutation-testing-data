  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `c.id` is a string, while `c` is an object. In the original code, `c` is an object with properties such as `id`, `name`, and `timezones`. By replacing `c` with `c.id`, the function would return the `id` property of the `c` object, which is a string, instead of the `c` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `c.name` is a string, while `c` is an object. In the original code, `c` is an object with properties such as `id`, `name`, and `timezones`. By replacing `c` with `c.name`, the function would return the `name` property of the `c` object, which is a string, instead of the `c` object itself.
