  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always reject the promise, whereas `thenResolve` will always resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function will always return the value, whereas `thenResolve` will return a promise that is resolved with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { throw value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function will always throw an exception, whereas `thenResolve` will return a promise that is resolved with the value.

DONE.
