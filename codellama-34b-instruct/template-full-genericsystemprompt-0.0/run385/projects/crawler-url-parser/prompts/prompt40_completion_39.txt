  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one condition to be true. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `parsedUrl.host` is null, but `baseUrlStr` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) with the negation operator (`!`) applied to `baseUrlStr`. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `parsedUrl.host` is null, but `baseUrlStr` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
