  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the `newPromise` and `message` arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `message` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message, message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the `newPromise`, `message`, and `message` arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `message` value twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message, message, message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the `newPromise`, `message`, `message`, and `message` arguments, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `message` value three times.

DONE.
