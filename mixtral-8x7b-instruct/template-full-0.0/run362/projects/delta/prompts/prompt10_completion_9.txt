 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the keys of `a` instead of `b`, potentially causing unexpected overwrites or omissions of attributes from the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it casts `a` to `any`, bypassing TypeScript's type checking and potentially causing type-related issues in the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(window as any).a
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `a` property of the `window` object, which is likely not the intended object and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
