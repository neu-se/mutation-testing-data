  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks = !!e.stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the actual value of `e.stack`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var hasStacks = e.stack ? true : false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `hasStacks` to `true` if `e.stack` is truthy, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks = Boolean(e.stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of `e.stack` to a boolean value using the `Boolean` function.

DONE.
