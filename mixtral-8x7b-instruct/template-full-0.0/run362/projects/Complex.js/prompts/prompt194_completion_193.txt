 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation formula for purely imaginary numbers uses `b` in the calculation, and setting it to 0 would change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation formula for purely imaginary numbers uses `b` in the calculation, and replacing `b` with `a` would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponentiation formula for purely imaginary numbers uses `b` (the imaginary part of the base) and `z['re']` (the real part of the exponent) in the calculation, and replacing `b` with `z['im'] * z['re']` would change the result.

DONE.
