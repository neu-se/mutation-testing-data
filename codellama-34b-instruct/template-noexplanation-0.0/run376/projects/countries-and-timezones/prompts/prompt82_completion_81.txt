  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This code fragment will return a deprecated country object instead of the current country object, which may cause the test to fail if it relies on the current country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { allTimezones: true })
```
This code fragment will return a country object with all timezones instead of the current country object, which may cause the test to fail if it relies on the current country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { timezones: [] })
```
This code fragment will return a country object with an empty timezones array instead of the current country object, which may cause the test to fail if it relies on the current country object.

DONE.
