  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the next ID, rather than the country with the current ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the previous ID, rather than the country with the current ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the double ID, rather than the country with the current ID.

DONE.
