 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.length = this.ops.length + 1;
this.ops[this.ops.length - 1] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of inserting the newOp at the correct index, it will always append it to the end of the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always prepend the newOp to the beginning of the ops array, instead of inserting it at the correct index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.splice(index - 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it will insert the newOp at the previous index, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the following operations.

DONE.
