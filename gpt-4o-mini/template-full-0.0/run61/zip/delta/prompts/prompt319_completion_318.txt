Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(op.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the retain operation to the inverted Delta instead of retaining it, which would lead to loss of information about the original operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete a length from the inverted Delta instead of retaining the operation, which would result in an incorrect transformation of the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(op.retain + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increments the retain length by 1, which would lead to an inaccurate representation of the original Delta's operations.

DONE.
