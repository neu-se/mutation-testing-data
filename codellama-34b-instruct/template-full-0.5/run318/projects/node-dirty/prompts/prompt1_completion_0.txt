  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` function is never called, which means that the database file is never loaded and the data is never persisted to disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Failed to load database file'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_load` function now throws an error, which means that the `load` event is never emitted and the `size` method will always return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._data = new Map(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_load` function now creates a new, empty `Map` object, which means that the data is not loaded from the database file and the `size` method will always return 0.

DONE.
