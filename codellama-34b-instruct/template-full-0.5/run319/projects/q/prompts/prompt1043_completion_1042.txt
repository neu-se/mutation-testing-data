  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the tail of the queue instead of the head, which could cause errors in the code that uses the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the tail of the head of the queue, which could cause errors in the code that uses the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail.head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the head of the tail of the queue, which could cause errors in the code that uses the queue.

DONE.
