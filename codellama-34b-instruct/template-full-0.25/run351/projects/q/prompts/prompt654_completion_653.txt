  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` would cause the promise to be resolved after a delay, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

DONE.
