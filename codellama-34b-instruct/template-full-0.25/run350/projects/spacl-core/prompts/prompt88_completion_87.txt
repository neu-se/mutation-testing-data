  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.forEach((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, but rather iterates over the existing one and applies the provided function to each element. In this case, the function is creating a new array with the policy name and the policy object, but the original array is not being modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map((policy) => [policy.name, policy]).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the same number of elements as the original array, but with the elements in reverse order. In this case, the function is creating a new array with the policy name and the policy object, but the order of the elements is reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter((policy) => policy.name === 'policy').map((policy) => [policy.name
