  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`, while `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`, while `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`, while `deferred.then` would create a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by `_fulfilled(value)`.

DONE.
