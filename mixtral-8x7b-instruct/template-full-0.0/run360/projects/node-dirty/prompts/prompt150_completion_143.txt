 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` now receives an extra argument `true`, which might not be handled correctly by the test suite and could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_writeStream` is destroyed, which would cause the write stream to close prematurely and potentially cause issues with the data being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => cb(null), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` is now called asynchronously, which might not be handled correctly by the test suite and could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
