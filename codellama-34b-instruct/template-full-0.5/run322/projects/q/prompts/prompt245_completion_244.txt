  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect(longStackCounter++);
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter++` would be evaluated to a different value than `longStackCounter` in the original code, which could cause the `inspect` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect(longStackCounter - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter - 1` would be evaluated to a different value than `longStackCounter` in the original code, which could cause the `inspect` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect(longStackCounter * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter * 2` would be evaluated to a different value than `longStackCounter` in the original code, which could cause the `inspect` method to return a
