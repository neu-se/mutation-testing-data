Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the pathname instead of the hostname, potentially leading to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking a lowercase version of the hostname, potentially leading to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain if the hostname contains uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking a modified version of the hostname with an extra character 'x' appended, potentially leading to incorrect removal of the 'www.' subdomain.

DONE.
