  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && any`, which would have a different result than the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `any`, which would have a different result than the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && !any`, which would have a different result than the original expression.

DONE.
