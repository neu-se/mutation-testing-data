  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not necessarily a number, and the code would throw an error if it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + (curr.retain || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` and `undefined` values as `0`, which could cause the code to behave differently if those values are present in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + (curr.retain || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` and `undefined` values as `1`, which could cause the code to behave differently if those values are present in the `ops` array.

DONE.
