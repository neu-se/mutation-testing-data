  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable would be set to `true`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and the `read` function to be called with the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable would be set to `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `read` function to be called with the `null` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable would be set to `undefined`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `read` function to be called with the `null` argument.

DONE.
