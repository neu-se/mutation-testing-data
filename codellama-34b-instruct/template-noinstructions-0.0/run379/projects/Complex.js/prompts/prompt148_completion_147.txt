  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while the replaced code fragment checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is zero, while the replaced code fragment checks if `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is NaN, while the replaced code fragment checks if `z` is NaN.

DONE.
