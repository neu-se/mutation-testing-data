 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now checks for `true` instead of `false`, effectively reversing the logic of the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === !op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` is added, which negates the result of the function call `op(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is replaced with the `read` variable, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false` if `read` is truthy, since `read` is a function and cannot be equal to `false`.

DONE.
