  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not called, and the `spawn` function would not be able to create a generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with the global object as its context, rather than the `spawn` function's context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(spawn, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with the `spawn` function as its context, but without any arguments.

DONE.
