  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the iterator by one step, even if the current operation is not a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of characters to be deleted, which may be different from the number of characters in the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of characters to be retained, which may be different from the number of characters in the current operation.

DONE.
