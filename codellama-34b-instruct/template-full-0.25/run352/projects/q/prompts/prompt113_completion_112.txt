  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context, whereas `call` and `apply` invoke the function with the specified context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` with a null context would invoke the function with the global object as the context, whereas `apply` and `bind` would use the original context.

DONE.
