 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the `slice` method is changed, which would return a different slice of the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the starting index of the slice is incremented by 1, which would result in a different slice of the `base` Delta being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the ending index of the slice is incremented by 1, which would result in a slice that includes an extra operation from the `base` Delta.

DONE.
