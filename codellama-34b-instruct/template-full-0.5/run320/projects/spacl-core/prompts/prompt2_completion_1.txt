  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `!spec.match` would return `true` if the `spec` string does not match the regular expression, whereas the original code fragment would return `null` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.search` would return the index of the first match of the regular expression in the `spec` string, whereas the original code fragment would return `null` if there is no match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.replace` would replace the first match of the regular expression in the `spec` string with the replacement string, whereas the original code fragment would return `null` if there is no match.

DONE.
