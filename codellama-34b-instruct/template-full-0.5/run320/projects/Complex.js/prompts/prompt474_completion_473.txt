  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different function from `isNaN`, and it checks for the opposite condition (whether a value is finite or not).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different function from `isNaN`, and it checks for the opposite condition (whether a value is infinite or not).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of `isNaN`, which means that if the imaginary part is not a number, the function will return `true`, whereas the original code would return `false`.

DONE.
