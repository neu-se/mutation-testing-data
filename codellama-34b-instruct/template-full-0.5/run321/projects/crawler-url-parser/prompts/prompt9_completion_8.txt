  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used in the `URL.parse()` method, which would throw an error if it is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used in the `URL.parse()` method, which would throw an error if it is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used in the `URL.parse()` method, which would throw an error if it is an empty string.

DONE.
