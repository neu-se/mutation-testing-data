  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable would be initialized with `null` instead of the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable would be initialized with `undefined` instead of the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable would be initialized with an empty array instead of the actual arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
