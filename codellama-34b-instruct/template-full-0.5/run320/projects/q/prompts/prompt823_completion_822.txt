  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the original error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject("Different rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the original rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve("Different resolution");
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolution value would be different, which could cause the test to fail if it is expecting the original resolution value.

DONE.
