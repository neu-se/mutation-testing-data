Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[tzs[key].name] = tzs[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the key used in the `prev` object from the original `key` to `tzs[key].name`, which may lead to overwriting existing entries in `prev` if multiple timezones share the same name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = { ...tzs[key], deprecated: true };
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `deprecated` property of each timezone to `true`, effectively marking all timezones as deprecated regardless of their original state, which could lead to incorrect data being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets each timezone entry in `prev` to `null`, effectively removing all timezones from the returned object, which would lead to a loss of all timezone data.

DONE.
