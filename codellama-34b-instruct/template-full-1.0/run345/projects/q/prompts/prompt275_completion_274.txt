  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving a promise with `null` is different from resolving it with `self.reject`, which is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving a promise with `undefined` is different from resolving it with `self.reject`, which is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving a promise with a rejected promise is different from resolving it with `self.reject`, which is also a rejected promise.

DONE.
