  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
this.rules.pop(...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, while `push` adds new elements to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
this.rules = rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it reassigns the `rules` property of the `Policy` object to a new array, rather than adding new elements to the existing array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
this.rules.shift(...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, while `push` adds new elements to the end of the array.

DONE.
