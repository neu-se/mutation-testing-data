  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null`, regardless of the input parameters, because the string `"foo"` is not a valid policy name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null`, regardless of the input parameters, because the uppercase version of the policy name is not a valid policy name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null`, regardless of the input parameters, because the reversed version of the policy name is not a valid policy name.

DONE.
