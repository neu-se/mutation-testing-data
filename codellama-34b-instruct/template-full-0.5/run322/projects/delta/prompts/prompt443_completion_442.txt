  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to return a string that is one character longer than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to return a string that is one character shorter than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to return a string that is twice as long as the original.

DONE.
