  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the next op from the other iterator to the delta, which is not the intention of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the next op from the this iterator to the delta, which is not the intention of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next().retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the retain property of the next op from the other iterator to the delta, which is not the intention of the code.

DONE.
