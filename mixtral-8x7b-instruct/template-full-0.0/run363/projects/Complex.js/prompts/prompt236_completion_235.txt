 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the square root function has changed, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the square root function is now the same as the original code, but the value is being recomputed, potentially leading to different results due to floating-point precision errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the square root function has changed, leading to different results.

DONE.
