  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an argument to `array_slice`, which would result in an empty array being returned, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as an argument to `array_slice`, which would result in an empty array being returned, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as an argument to `array_slice`, which would result in an empty array being returned, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
