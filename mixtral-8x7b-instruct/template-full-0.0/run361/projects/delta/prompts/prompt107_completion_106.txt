 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` applies the provided function to each element in the array and returns a new array with the results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value, while `map` applies the provided function to each element in the array and returns a new array with the results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` executes the provided function once for each element in the array, while `map` applies the provided function to each element in the array and returns a new array with the results.
