  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `next()` returns the next element and advances the iterator. In this code, `next()` is used to iterate over the elements of the iterator, so replacing it with `peek()` would result in an infinite loop.
DONE.
