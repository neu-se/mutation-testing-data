Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the `ops` array regardless of whether it meets the condition of being a retain operation with no attributes, potentially leading to unintended data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(lastOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to pop the last operation using the `lastOp` variable, which is not a valid argument for the `pop` method, leading to a runtime error instead of correctly removing the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `pop` method does not affect the array, effectively leaving the last operation unchanged, which contradicts the intended functionality of removing it under specific conditions.

DONE.
