  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are in the wrong order. The method expects the array to contain the name first, followed by the arguments, but this replacement would put the arguments first and the name second. This would result in a different method call and potentially different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[!name, !nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, so `!name` would be `true` if name is not defined or is `false`, and `!nodeArgs` would be `true` if nodeArgs is not defined or is an empty array. This would result in a different method call and potentially different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would reverse the order of the elements in the `nodeArgs` array. This would
