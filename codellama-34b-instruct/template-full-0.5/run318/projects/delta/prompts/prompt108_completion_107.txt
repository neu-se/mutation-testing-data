  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function checks if the current element is an object, while this new predicate function checks if the current index is even.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function checks if the current element is an object, while this new predicate function checks if the current element has any attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original predicate function checks if the current element is an object, while this new predicate function checks if the current element does not have any attributes.

DONE.
