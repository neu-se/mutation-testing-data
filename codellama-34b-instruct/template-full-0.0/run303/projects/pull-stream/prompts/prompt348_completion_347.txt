  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that allows changing the value of `this` inside a function, and passing `null` as the first argument would cause the function to be called with `this` set to `null`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function with the same body as the original function, but with the `this` value set to `null` and the first argument set to `data`. This may not be the intended behavior, and could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.apply(null, [data])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given
