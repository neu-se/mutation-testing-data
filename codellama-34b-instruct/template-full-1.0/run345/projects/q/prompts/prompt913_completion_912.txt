  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that does nothing, instead of calling `array_slice` which returns a slice of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as an argument to `nodeArgs.push`, instead of passing the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x, y) { return y + x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that takes two arguments and returns their sum, instead of calling `array_slice` which returns a slice of an array.

DONE.
