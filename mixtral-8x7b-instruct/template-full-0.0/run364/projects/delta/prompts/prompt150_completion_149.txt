 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current iterator instead of the other iterator, potentially causing incorrect operations to be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => otherIter.next()
