  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.nfapply` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename, "utf-8"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.nfapply` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(FS.readFile, [__filename, "utf-8", "base64"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.nfapply` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
