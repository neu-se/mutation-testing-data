  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the unhandled reasons array, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to not work correctly.

DONE.
