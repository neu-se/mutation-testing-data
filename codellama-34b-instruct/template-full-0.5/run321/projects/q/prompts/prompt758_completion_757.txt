  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of states for the respective values, while `allFulfilled` returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of states for the respective values, while `anyRejected` returns a promise for the first rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of states for the respective values, while `allRejected` returns a promise for an array of rejected promises.

DONE.
