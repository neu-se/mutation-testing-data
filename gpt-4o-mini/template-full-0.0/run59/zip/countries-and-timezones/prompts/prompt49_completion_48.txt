Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array of the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `forEach` executes a provided function once for each array element without returning a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `forEach` does not create a new array and does not filter elements based on any condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.timezones).forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names, potentially leading to different iterations over the data.

DONE.
