  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` property is always defined, whereas `row.val` may be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property may be undefined, causing an error when attempting to add 1 to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val` property may be undefined, causing an error when attempting to call the `toUpperCase()` method on it.

DONE.
