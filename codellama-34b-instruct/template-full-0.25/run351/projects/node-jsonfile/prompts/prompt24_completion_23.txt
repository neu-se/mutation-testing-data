  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to the `JSON.parse` method, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains any non-standard data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is being passed to the `JSON.parse` method, but only if it is defined. If it is not defined, `null` will be passed instead, which could cause issues if the JSON data contains any non-standard data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || function(key, value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is being passed to the `JSON.parse` method, but
