  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for the `GET` verb, regardless of whether it is explicitly allowed or denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'POST'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `false` for the `POST` verb, regardless of whether it is explicitly allowed or denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'PUT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null` for the `PUT` verb, regardless of whether it is explicitly allowed or denied.

DONE.
