  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word === rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the word is identical to the regular expression instead of checking if the regular expression matches the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the word matches the regular expression instead of checking if the regular expression matches the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the regular expression matches the word by executing the regular expression on the word, which would result in a different output than the original code.

DONE.
