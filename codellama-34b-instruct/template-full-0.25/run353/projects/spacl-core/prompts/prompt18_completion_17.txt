  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `spec` string into an array of path segments, and then uses the `slice` method to remove the first segment and the `reverse` method to reverse the order of the remaining segments. The new code fragment uses the `join` method to join the array of path segments back into a string, without modifying the order of the segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(segment => segment.toUpperCase()).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the case of the path segments, while the new code fragment uses the `map` method to convert each segment to uppercase before joining them back into a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().
