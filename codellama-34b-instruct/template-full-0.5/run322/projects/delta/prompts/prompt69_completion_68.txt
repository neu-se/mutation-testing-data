  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `length` is less than or equal to 0, but this replacement would only check if `length` is strictly less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof length !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `length` is a number, but this replacement would check if `length` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `length` is less than or equal to 0, but this replacement would check if `length` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
