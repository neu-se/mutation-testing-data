Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now call `abortCb` only when `abort` is false, which is the opposite of the original logic, potentially allowing the callback to proceed when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if `abort` is strictly equal to `true`, which may lead to unexpected behavior if `abort` is a truthy value other than `true`, thus bypassing the abort logic in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly trigger the abort callback when `i` is less than the length of the array, which is the opposite of the intended logic, potentially causing premature termination of the callback sequence.

DONE.
