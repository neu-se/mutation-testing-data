  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `Math.ceil`.
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor` to round the real and imaginary parts of the complex number towards negative infinity, whereas `Math.ceil` would round them towards positive infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `a * Math.floor(b / a) / a + b % a`.
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor` to round the result of dividing `b` by `a` towards negative infinity, whereas this new code fragment would round towards positive infinity and then add the remainder of the division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `a / b * Math.floor(a / b) + Math.abs(a) % (b / a)`.
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor` to round the result of dividing `a` by `b` towards negative infinity, whereas this new code fragment would round towards positive infinity, then add the result of multiplying the
