  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `shouldThrow` is strictly equal to `false`, which is not the same as checking if it is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `shouldThrow` is not strictly equal to `true`, which is not the same as checking if it is `false`.

DONE.
