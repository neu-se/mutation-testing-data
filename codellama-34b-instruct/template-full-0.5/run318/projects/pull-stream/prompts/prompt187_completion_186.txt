  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would be called with `true` as its argument. In the original code, the `if` statement evaluates to `true` if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, and `cb` is called with `array[i++]` as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would be called with `true` as its argument. In the original code, the `if` statement evaluates to `true` if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, and `cb` is called with `array[i++]` as its argument.
