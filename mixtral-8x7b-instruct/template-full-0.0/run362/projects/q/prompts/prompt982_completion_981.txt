 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs, deferred.makeNodeResolver()])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` is now passed as a third argument to the `dispatch()` method instead of being pushed to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs])
