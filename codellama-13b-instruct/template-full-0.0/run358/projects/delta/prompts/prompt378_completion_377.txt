  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops` property is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

DONE.
