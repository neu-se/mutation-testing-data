  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `null` is a constant value that is not related to the function's input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `undefined` is a value that is not defined and cannot be used as a reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"data"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter passed to the function, while `"data"` is a string literal that is not related to the function's input.

DONE.
