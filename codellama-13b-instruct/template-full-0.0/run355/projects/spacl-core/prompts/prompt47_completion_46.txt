  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character that is not a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character that is not a forward slash, and also matches any string that contains only forward slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that contains at least one character that is not a forward slash, and also matches any string that contains only forward slashes.

DONE.
