  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url && currentUrl.url.length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `currentUrl` object is truthy, and if its `url` property is also truthy and has a length greater than 0. This is a more explicit check than the original code fragment, which only checked if `currentUrl` was truthy and if its `url` property was defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url && currentUrl.url.trim().length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `currentUrl` object is truthy, and if its `url` property is also truthy and has a length greater than 0 after trimming any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string. This is similar to the previous option, but it also removes any whitespace characters from the beginning and end of the string before checking its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
