  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length, num
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.length` would return the length of the string, whereas `this` would return the string itself, which could lead to different results in the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `num` would be the first argument passed to the `plural` function, whereas `this` would be the string itself, which could lead to different results in the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `num + 1` would be a different value than `num`, which could lead to different results in the `plural` function.

DONE.
