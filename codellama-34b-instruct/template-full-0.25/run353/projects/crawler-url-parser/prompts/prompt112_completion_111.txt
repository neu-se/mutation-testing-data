  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `currentUrl` variable to be reassigned, potentially changing the behavior of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(baseUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `currentUrl` variable to be reassigned with a different set of parameters, potentially changing the behavior of the `gettype` function.

DONE.
