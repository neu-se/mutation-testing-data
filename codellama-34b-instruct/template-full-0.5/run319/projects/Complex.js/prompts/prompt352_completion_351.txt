  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b + 1` would refer to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b * 2` would refer to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `-b` would refer to the negative of the imaginary part.

DONE.
