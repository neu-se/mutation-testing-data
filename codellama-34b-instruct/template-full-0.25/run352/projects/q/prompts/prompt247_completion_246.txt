  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack trace, instead of just the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack trace, except for the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack trace, except for the first two characters.

DONE.
