  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, but `a + b` is an expression that adds the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, but `a * b` is an expression that multiplies the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, but `a / b` is an expression that divides the value of `a` by `b`.

DONE.
