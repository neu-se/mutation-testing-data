Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/([^\S\r\n]+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split on whitespace characters (excluding newline), but would not consider other special characters like parentheses, brackets, or quotes as token boundaries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\r\n/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split on newline characters, ignoring all other whitespace characters and special characters, which could lead to incorrect tokenization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split on word boundaries, which could lead to incorrect tokenization, especially for non-English characters or special cases like punctuation attached to words.

DONE.
