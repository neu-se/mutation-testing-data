  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause the code to execute unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error message, which could cause the code to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different rejection reason, which could cause the code to execute differently.

DONE.
