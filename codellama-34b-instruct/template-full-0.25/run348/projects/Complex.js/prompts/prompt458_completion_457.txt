  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, and `false` when it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both finite, whereas the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), whereas the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.
