  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when `other.ops` has more than one element, which could cause the `concat` method to return a delta with more than one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be false when `other.ops` has no elements, which could cause the `concat` method to return an empty delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 1 && other.ops[0].insert === 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true only when `other.ops` has exactly one element and that element has an `insert` property with the value `'foo'`, which could cause the `concat` method to return a delta with a different value.

DONE.
