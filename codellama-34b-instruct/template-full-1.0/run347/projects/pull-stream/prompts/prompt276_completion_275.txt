  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextStream` function would be called with `null` instead of the expected `read` function, which could lead to unexpected consequences in the entire stream of streams.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with `null`, which could lead to unexpected consequences in the entire stream of streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function (abort, cb) {
  read(abort, cb)
}
```
This would
