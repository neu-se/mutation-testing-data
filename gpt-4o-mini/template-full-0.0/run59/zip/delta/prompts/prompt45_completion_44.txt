Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-null objects to be retained, which contradicts the original intention of rejecting non-object or null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow arrays to be retained, rejecting all other object types, which is not the intended validation for the `b` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only accept strings as valid input for `b`, rejecting all other types, including objects, which is contrary to the original logic that expects `b` to be an object.

DONE.
