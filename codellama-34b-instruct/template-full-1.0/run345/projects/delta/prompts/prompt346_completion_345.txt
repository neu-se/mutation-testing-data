  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not modify the value of `opData`, while the modified code fragment would increment the value of `opData` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not modify the value of `opData`, while the modified code fragment would multiply the value of `opData` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not modify the value of `opData`, while the modified code fragment would decrement the value of `opData` by 1.

DONE.
