 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"call", [array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method has a different behavior than `apply`, it passes arguments as separate arguments instead of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is used instead of `void 0` (undefined), which can cause issues if the function being applied expects the `this` value to be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apply", [, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `apply` method is missing, this will cause the function to receive `undefined` as the `this` value, which can cause issues if the function being applied expects a different `this` value.

DONE.
