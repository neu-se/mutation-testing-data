  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This change will cause the `flatten` function to be called with `false` as an argument, which will result in the `parts` array being flattened differently than it would have been with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This change will cause the `flatten` function to be called with `true` as an argument, which will result in the `parts` array being flattened differently than it would have been with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(min > 0)
```
This change will cause the `flatten` function to be called with `min > 0` as an argument, which will result in the `parts` array being flattened differently than it would have been with the original code.

DONE.
