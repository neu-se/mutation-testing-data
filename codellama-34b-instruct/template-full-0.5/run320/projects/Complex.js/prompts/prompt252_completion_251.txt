  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function is not defined in the code snippet, and the `cos` function is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function is defined in the code snippet, and the `cos` function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function is defined in the code snippet, and the `cos` function is not defined.

DONE.
