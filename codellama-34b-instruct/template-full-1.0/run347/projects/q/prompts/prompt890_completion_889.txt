  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would return a bound function with `object` as Its context, rather than `callback` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(object).then(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be executed after `object` is resolved, rather than immediately after `callback` is resolved in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[callback]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` property of `object`, with no guarantee that it is a function, rather than calling `callback` as a function in the original code.

DONE.
