 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/.*\/$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows paths to end with any whitespace character followed by a slash, instead of strictly checking for the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/.test(spec)
