  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of the argument would change to `void`, which would cause a type error if the argument is used in a way that requires a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be a constant value, which would cause the `nextTick` function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be an object, which would cause the `nextTick` function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
