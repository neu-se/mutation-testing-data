  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method than "post", and would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are passed in a different order, and the method would likely fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "optional"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the method call, which may cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
