 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a blocking synchronous version of `readFile`, which would affect the asynchronous nature of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFile` is a function for writing data to a file, not reading from it. This change would cause the function to fail when trying to parse the result as JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs._fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `_fs` property of `fs`, which is not a standard property and may not exist in all implementations. This would cause the code to fail if the property is not present.

DONE.
