Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly removes only the last character instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words that should end in 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the 'es' suffix with 's', which is incorrect for words that should end in 'es', thus failing to apply the proper pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 'ies' instead of 'es', which is incorrect for words that should simply have 'es' added, leading to incorrect plural forms.

DONE.
