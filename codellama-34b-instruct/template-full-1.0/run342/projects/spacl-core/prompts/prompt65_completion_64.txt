  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat(new Rule())
```
This would result in different behavior because it will add an additional Rule object to the `rules` array, which may cause the policy to allow actions that it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will remove the first Rule object from the `rules` array, which may cause the policy to deny actions that it should allow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will reverse the order of the Rule objects in the `rules` array, which may cause the policy to allow actions that it should not.

DONE.
