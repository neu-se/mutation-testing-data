  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(x)` returns the sine of `x`, whereas `Math.exp(x)` returns the exponential of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(x)` returns the tangent of `x`, whereas `Math.exp(x)` returns the exponential of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(x)` returns the natural logarithm of `x`, whereas `Math.exp(x)` returns the exponential of `x`.

DONE.
