  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first character of the line, rather than the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(1, line.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line without the first character, rather than the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.slice(0, line.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line without the last character, rather than the entire line.

DONE.
