  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `thisp` argument in the `Q.nbind` method, which is used as the `this` argument in the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of the `thisp` argument in the `Q.nbind` method, which could affect the outcome of the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `thisp` argument in the `Q.nbind` method to null, which could cause the callback function to fail.

DONE.
