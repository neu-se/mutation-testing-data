  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not return the correct plural form for the word "memo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function() { return 'memos'; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be able to access the word "memo" as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be able to access the word "memo" as an argument.

DONE.
