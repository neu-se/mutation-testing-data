  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed immediately, rather than being returned as a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` would be returned as a resolved promise, rather than being thrown as an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` would be returned as a rejected promise, rather than being thrown as an error.

DONE.
