  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)`, which includes all elements of the `arguments` object from the first element to the end. While the modified code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which includes all elements of the `arguments` object from the second element to the end, skipping the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)`, which includes all elements of the `arguments` object from the first element to the end. While the modified code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which includes all elements of the `arguments` object from the third element to the end, skipping the first two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
