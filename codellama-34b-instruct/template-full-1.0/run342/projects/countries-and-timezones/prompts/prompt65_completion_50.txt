```
countries[id].allTimezones

Using `countries[id]` would only return the country object itself, while `countries[id].allTimezones` would return an array of all timezones for that country, or `undefined` if the property is not present.

Using `timezones[country.id]` would return a timezone object if the country has a corresponding timezone, or `undefined` if the country does not have a corresponding timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const timezone = getTimezone(country.id);
