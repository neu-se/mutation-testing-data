  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, which is not the same as the `error` event, which is emitted when there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` event is emitted when there is data available to be read from the stream, which is not the same as the `error` event, which is emitted when there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is no longer blocked by the operating system, which is not the same as the `error` event, which is emitted when there is an error.

DONE.
