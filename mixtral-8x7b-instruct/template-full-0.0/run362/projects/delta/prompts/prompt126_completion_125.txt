 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would no longer iterate over the operations starting from the `start` index, but instead from the end of the operations list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === start
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would only iterate once, when the `index` is equal to `start`. This would cause the code to ignore any operations that come after the `start` index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the while loop would iterate over the operations starting from the `start` index, but would also include the operation at the `start` index. This could cause unexpected behavior if the operation at the `start` index should not be included in the iteration.

DONE.
