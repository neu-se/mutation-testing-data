  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value when the `cb` argument is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value when the `cb` argument is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value when the `cb` argument is not provided.

DONE.
