  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was pushing the part variable to the parts array, which was a string. However, the replacement code fragment is pushing the result of the regex match to the parts array, which is an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the replace method to replace any occurrence of the period or dollar sign in the part variable with the same character preceded by a backslash. However, the replacement code fragment is using the replace method to replace any occurrence of the period or dollar sign in the part variable with the same character preceded by a backslash, but it is also using the global flag, which means that all occurrences in the string will be replaced, not just the first one.
