Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string' && op.retain.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a non-empty string instead of checking if it is an object, which would cause the condition to fail for valid object types, leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is strictly `undefined`, which would skip valid object types and lead to incorrect processing of operations that should be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is an array, which would incorrectly exclude valid object types and lead to improper handling of operations that are not arrays.

DONE.
