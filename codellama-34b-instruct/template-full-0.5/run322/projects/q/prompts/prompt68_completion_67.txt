  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Boom!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but the new code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "Hello, world!";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return a value, but the new code fragment returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not log a message to the console, but the new code fragment does.

DONE.
