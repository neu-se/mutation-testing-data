  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to execute a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check for a different type of operation, causing the code to execute a different branch of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check for a different type of operation, causing the code to execute a different branch of the `if` statement.

DONE.
