  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would return the string starting from the second character, whereas `options.dest` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('/')` would split the string into an array of substrings using `/` as the separator, and `pop()` would return the last element of the array, whereas `options.dest` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace(/\//g, '')` would replace all occurrences of `/` in the string with an empty string, whereas `options.dest` would return the entire string.

DONE.
