  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next value in the iteration without advancing the iterator, while `next` returns the next value and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next value, while `next` returns the next value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more values in the iteration, while `next` returns the next value.

DONE.
