  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tar` method is not the same as the `zip` method, and it would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` method is not the same as the `tar` method, and it would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"gzip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` method is not the same as the `zip` method, and it would produce a different output.

DONE.
