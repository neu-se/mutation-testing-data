  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` flag only checks for read permission, while the original code fragment checks for both read and write permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag only checks for write permission, while the original code fragment checks for both read and write permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` flag only checks for execute permission, while the original code fragment checks for both read and write permission.

DONE.
