  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the method signature has been changed to include an extra argument, which would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, -distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance argument has been negated, which would cause the destination point to be calculated based on a negative distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, Math.abs(distance), bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance argument has been passed through the `Math.abs()` function, which would cause the destination point to be calculated based on the absolute value of the distance. DONE.
