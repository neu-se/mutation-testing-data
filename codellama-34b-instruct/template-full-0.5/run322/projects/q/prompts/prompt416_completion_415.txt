  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect().value` would return the fulfillment value of the promise, while `object.inspect().state` would return the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect().state === "rejected"` would return `true` if the promise is rejected, while `object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"` would return `true` if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect().state === "pending"` would return `true` if the promise is pending, while `object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"` would return `true` if the promise is fulfilled
