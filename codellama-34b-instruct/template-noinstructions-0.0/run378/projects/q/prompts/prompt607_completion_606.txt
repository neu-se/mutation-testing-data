  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` in the `dispatch` method. By adding 1 to `op`, the operation performed on the `object` would be different, potentially causing the method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` in the `dispatch` method. By subtracting 1 from `op`, the operation performed on the `object` would be different, potentially causing the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the `object` in the `dispatch` method. By multiplying `op` by 2,
