  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with `null` as its argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would be called with the number `42` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `42` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
