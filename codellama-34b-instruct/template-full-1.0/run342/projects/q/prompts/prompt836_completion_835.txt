  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would not bind the current domain to the callback, whereas the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would not bind the current domain to the callback, whereas the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would not bind the current domain to the callback, whereas the original code does.

DONE.
