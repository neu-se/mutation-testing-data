  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    newOpNonexistent
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonexistent` attribute would potentially introduce a new bug in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    newOpPlusOne
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the existing value of `newOp` would change the output of the `delta.ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    newOpTimesTwo
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the existing value of `newOp` by 2 would change the output of the `delta.ops` array.

DONE.
