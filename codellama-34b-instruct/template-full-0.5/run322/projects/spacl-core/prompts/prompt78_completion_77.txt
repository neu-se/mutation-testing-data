  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `rules` array, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the `rules` array starting from the second element, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.concat(new Rule())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the `rules` array with a new `Rule` object, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query()` method.

DONE.
