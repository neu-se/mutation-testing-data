 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of an error object when trying to get a value from a closed queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return an empty object instead of an error object when trying to get a value from a closed queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a rejected promise instead of an error object when trying to get a value from a closed queue. This would make it harder to distinguish between a closed queue and a queue with an actual error in its elements.

DONE.
