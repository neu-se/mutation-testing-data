  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the longitude value is within the range of -180 to 180 degrees, while the new code fragment checks if the longitude value is less than -180 or greater than 180 degrees. This could potentially cause issues if the longitude value is not within the expected range.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 && longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the longitude value is within the range of -180 to 180 degrees, while the new code fragment checks if the longitude value is both less than -180 and greater than 180 degrees. This could potentially cause issues if the longitude value is not within the expected range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 ||
