  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the path matches one of the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the path matches one of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the path matches one of the rules.

DONE.
