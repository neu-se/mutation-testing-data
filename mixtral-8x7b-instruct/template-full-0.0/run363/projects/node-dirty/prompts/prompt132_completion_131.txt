 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(this._queue)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the first entry of the `this._queue` object, but not necessarily in the order of insertion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(this._queue.entries())[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `this._queue` map to an array of key-value pairs, but not necessarily in the order of insertion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const keys = Array.from(this._queue.keys());
const key = keys[0];
const cbs = this._queue.get(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it first retrieves the keys from the `this._queue` map, then gets the first key and its corresponding value, but not necessarily in the order of insertion.

DONE.
