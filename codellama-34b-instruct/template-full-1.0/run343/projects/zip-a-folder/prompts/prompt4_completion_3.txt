  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the `medium` compression level is not the same as the `uncompressed` compression level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions.compression
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the `compression` property, causing the condition to be `true` when it was originally `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions["compression"] === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the property is accessed using bracket notation instead of dot notation, and the value is compared to the `high` compression level instead of the `uncompressed` compression level.

DONE.
