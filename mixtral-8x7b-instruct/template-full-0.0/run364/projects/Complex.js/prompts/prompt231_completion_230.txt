 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is flipped, which can cause significant changes in the complex plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result is always 0, which is incorrect when the input has a non-zero imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to division by zero when the input's imaginary part is zero, causing the function to fail or throw an exception.

DONE.
