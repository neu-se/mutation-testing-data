  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy,
so the `!end` condition would never be true, and `op` will always be executed, even if `end` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is always truthy,
so the `!end` condition would never be true, and `op` will always be executed, even if `end` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is always false,
so the `!end` condition would always be true, and `op` will never be executed, even if `end` is true.

DONE.
