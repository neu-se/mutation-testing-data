  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `match` variable is null, while this replacement checks if it is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `match` variable is null, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `match` variable is null, while this replacement checks if its length is 0.

DONE.
