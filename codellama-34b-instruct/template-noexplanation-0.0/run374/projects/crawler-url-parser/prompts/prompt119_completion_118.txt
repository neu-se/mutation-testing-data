  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `protocol` property of the `baseUrl` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `baseUrl`, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `host` property of the `baseUrl` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `baseUrl`, which is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.pathname
```
This code fragment is a property access expression that accesses the `pathname` property of the `baseUrl` object. It is a different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `baseUrl`, which is an object.

DONE.
