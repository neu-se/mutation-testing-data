  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ceils` method would be called on a positive value instead of a negative value, which would affect the rounding behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would be called on a non-zero value instead of a zero value, which would affect the rounding behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
an alternative to b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `floor` method would be called on a different value, which would affect the rounding behavior.

DONE.
