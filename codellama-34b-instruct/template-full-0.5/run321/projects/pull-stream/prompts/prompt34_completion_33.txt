  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the second argument instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the `i`th argument instead of the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the last argument instead of the first one.

DONE.
