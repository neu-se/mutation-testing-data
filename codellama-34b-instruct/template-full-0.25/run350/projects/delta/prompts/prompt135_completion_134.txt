  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next element, whereas `otherIter.peek()` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(1)` returns the next element without advancing the iterator, but it also skips over the first element in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(-1)` returns the previous element without advancing the iterator, which could cause the iteration to start at a different position.

DONE.
