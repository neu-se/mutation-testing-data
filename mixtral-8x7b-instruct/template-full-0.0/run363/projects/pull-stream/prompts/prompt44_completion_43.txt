 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which could cause issues if the function is not called as a method of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new empty array, which would not have the same effect as passing `null, ref`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a built-in identifier in JavaScript that provides access to the arguments passed to a function. Using `arguments` instead of `null, ref` would change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
