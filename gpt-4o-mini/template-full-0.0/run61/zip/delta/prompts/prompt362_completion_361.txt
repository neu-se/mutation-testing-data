Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate immediately, preventing any operations from being processed, which could lead to incorrect results when transforming the `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop while both iterators have next elements, potentially skipping operations from one of the `Delta` objects if the other runs out of elements first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue as long as there are no more elements in `thisIter`, which could lead to processing elements from `otherIter` even when `thisIter` has remaining operations, resulting in incorrect transformations.

DONE.
