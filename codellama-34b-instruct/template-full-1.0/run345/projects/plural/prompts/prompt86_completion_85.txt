  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "person" is "people," not "peoples."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'humans')
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "person" is "people," not "humans."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "person" is determined by adding an "s" to the end of the word, not by replacing it with "people."

DONE.
