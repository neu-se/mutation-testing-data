  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` prototype, and they have different behaviors when it comes to the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, whereas `call` and `apply` do not change the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, whereas `call` and `apply` do not change the context of the function.

DONE.
