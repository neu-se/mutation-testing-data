  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state == "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state == "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending, which is not the same as checking if it is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().value != promise.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, so the code inside the `else` block would never run.

DONE.
