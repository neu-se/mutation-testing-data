  Sure, here are three different mutations for the given code snippet:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the `data` value before passing it to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects the original value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the `data` value by 2 before passing it to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects the original value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the `data` value before passing it to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects the original value of `data`.
