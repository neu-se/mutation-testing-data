Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `normalizedUrl` which has undergone some transformations to handle special cases, whereas using `url` directly would bypass these transformations and potentially lead to incorrect decoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `decodeURI` to decode the URL, whereas using `encodeURI` would encode the URL instead, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `unescape` on `normalizedUrl`, whereas using `unescape` on the original `url` would apply the unescaping transformation to the original URL without considering the special cases handled by `normalizedUrl`.

DONE.
