  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[2]` would cause the `switch` statement to return a different value than `ref[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length - 1]` would cause the `switch` statement to return a different value than `ref[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause the `switch` statement to return a different value than `ref[1]`.

DONE.
