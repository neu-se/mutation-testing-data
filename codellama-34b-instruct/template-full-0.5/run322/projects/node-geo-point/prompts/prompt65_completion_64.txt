  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the +10 would cause the bearing calculation to be off by 10 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the *2 would cause the bearing calculation to be twice as large as it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the -10 would cause the bearing calculation to be off by -10 degrees.

DONE.
