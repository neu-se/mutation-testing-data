  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-null value, while the mutated code fragment sets it to null. This could cause the `insert` method to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures if the test suite is not robust enough to handle this type of mutation.

DONE.
