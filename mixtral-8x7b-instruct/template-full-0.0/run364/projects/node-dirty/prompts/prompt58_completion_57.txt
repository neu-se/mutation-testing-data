 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `close` method with an empty function, preventing the actual closing behavior from being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the `close` method to `undefined`, causing a `TypeError` when trying to call an undefined method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = this.set;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `close` method with the `set` method, causing unexpected behavior when the `close` method is called, as it would then perform the functionality of the `set` method.

DONE.
