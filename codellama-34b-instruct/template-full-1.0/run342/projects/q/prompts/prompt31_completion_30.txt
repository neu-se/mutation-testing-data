  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.pop()` would return `undefined`, instead of a task to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push();
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.push()` would add a new task to the end of the queue, instead of removing a task from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.shift()` would remove and return the first task in the queue, instead of the last task.

DONE.
