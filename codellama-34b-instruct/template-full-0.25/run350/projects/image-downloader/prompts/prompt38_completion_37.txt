  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'file.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a variable that refers to the destination file path, while the new code fragment `dest + 'file.txt'` is a string that concatenates the destination file path with the string `'file.txt'`. This change would cause the `createWriteStream` function to write to a different file than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/tmp/file.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a variable that refers to the destination file path, while the new code fragment `'/tmp/file.txt'` is a string that refers to a different file path. This change would cause the `createWriteStream` function to write to a different file than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a variable that refers to
