Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the URL directly instead of the pathname, which would lead to an incorrect filename being derived from the full URL instead of just the last segment of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra string to the pathname, which would change the basename derived from the path and potentially lead to an invalid or unexpected filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'' 
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an empty string instead of the pathname, which would result in the basename being derived from an empty value, leading to an incorrect or missing filename.

DONE.
