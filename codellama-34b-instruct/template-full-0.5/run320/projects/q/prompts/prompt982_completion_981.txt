  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not run and would produce an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.reject));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not run and would produce an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.resolve));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so the code would not run and would produce an error.

DONE.
