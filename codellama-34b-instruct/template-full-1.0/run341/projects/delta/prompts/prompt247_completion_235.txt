  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would delete one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would delete one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * opLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation would delete twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
