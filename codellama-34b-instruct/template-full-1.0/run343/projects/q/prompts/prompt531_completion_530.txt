  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a constant that represents the absence of any object value, and it would not have the same behavior as `object`, which is a variable that refers to an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a constant that represents the absence of any value, and it would not have the same behavior as `object`, which is a variable that refers to an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `property` property of the `object` variable, which may not exist or have a different value than `object` itself.

DONE.
