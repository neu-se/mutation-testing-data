  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an error instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined instead of the original value.

DONE.
