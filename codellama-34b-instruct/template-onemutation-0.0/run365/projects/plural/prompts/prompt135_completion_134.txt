  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the modified code fragment uses the lowercase version of the `word` variable. This could cause the pluralization rules to be applied incorrectly in some cases.
