  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as-is onto the array, while this modified code fragment pushes the item plus 1 onto the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as-is onto the array, while this modified code fragment pushes the item multiplied by 2 onto the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as-is onto the array, while this modified code fragment pushes the length of the item onto the array.

DONE.
