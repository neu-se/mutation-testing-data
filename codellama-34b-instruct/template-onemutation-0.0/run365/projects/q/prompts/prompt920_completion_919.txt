  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the `exception` argument is not `undefined`. However, the new code fragment would always reject the promise, regardless of the value of the `exception` argument.
