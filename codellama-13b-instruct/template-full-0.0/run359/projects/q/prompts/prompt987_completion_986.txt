  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "extra argument"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra argument would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "extra argument", "extra argument 2"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra arguments would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "extra argument", "extra argument 2", "extra argument 3"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra arguments would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the method to fail.

DONE.
