  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but instead it is being incremented by 1 before being passed. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `end` value is not what was expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function, but instead it is being decremented by 1 before being passed. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if the `end` value is not what was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is no longer being passed a value, but instead it is being passed `null`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently if it is expecting a value to be passed.
