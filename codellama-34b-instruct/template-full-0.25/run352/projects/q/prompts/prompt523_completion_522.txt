  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op].apply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` method on the `object` with the `args` array as arguments, whereas the original code calls the `dispatch` function with the `object`, `op`, and `args` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` method on the `object` with the `args` array as arguments, whereas the original code calls the `dispatch` function with the `object`, `op`, and `args` arguments.

DONE.
