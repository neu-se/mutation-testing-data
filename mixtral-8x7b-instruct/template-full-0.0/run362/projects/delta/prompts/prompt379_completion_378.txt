 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next operation from the other Delta, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the transformation process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null!;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would forcefully insert `null` into the resulting Delta, which might not be the intended behavior and could lead to errors or unexpected results when processing the transformed Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.retain(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same length as the other operation, without considering the actual content or attributes of the operations. This could lead to incorrect transformations or data loss in the resulting Delta.

DONE.
