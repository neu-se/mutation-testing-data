  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, causing the resulting promise to also be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled immediately, causing the resulting promise to also be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified immediately, causing the resulting promise to also be notified.

DONE.
