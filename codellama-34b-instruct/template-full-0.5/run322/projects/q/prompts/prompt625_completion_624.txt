  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` would throw an error when trying to set the property `key` on `null`, whereas the original code would set the property on the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` would throw an error when trying to set the property `key` on `undefined`, whereas the original code would set the property on the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ key: undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` would set the property `key` to `undefined` on the new object, whereas the original code would set the property on the original object.

DONE.
