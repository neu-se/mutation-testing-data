  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not have a rejection handler, and any rejections would be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would have a rejection handler that does nothing, rather than calling the `onUnhandledError` function.

DONE.
