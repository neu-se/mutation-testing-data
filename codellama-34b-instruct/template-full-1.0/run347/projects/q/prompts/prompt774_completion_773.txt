  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function (promise) { return promise.status === 'rejected'; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reject the promises in the array if they are already rejected, instead of rejecting them when they are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function (promise) { return promise.status === 'resolved'; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reject the promises in the array if they are already resolved, instead of rejecting them when they are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function (promise) { return promise.status; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the format of the output, returning an array of strings representing the status of each promise in the input array, instead of an array of promises.

DONE.
