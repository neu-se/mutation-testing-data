 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lose the context of the current `iter` object, causing an error when trying to access the `peekLength()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `index` variable instead of the length of the current operation, causing unexpected behavior in the `eachLine` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.skip
```
This would result in different behavior because `skip` is not a method of the `OpIterator` class, causing an error and preventing the correct execution of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
