  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert.length` would return the length of the inserted string, whereas `op` would return the entire inserted string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object, and `op.attributes.length` would return `undefined`, whereas `op` would return the entire inserted string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is `undefined`, and `op.retain.length` would throw a `TypeError`, whereas `op` would return the entire inserted string.

DONE.
