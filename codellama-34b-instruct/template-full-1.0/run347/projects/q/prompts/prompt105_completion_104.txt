  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis
```
This would result in different behavior because the existing code fragment is using the `this[index]` property and the new code fragment will only use the basis value, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because the existing code fragment is using the `this[index]` property and the new code fragment will only use the index value, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the existing code fragment is using the basis value and the new code fragment will only use the `this[index]` property, leading to a different result.

DONE.
