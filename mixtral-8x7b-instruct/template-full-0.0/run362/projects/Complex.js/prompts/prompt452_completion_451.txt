 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(z['im'] - this['im']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different operator (`<` instead of `<=`). This could cause some cases where the original code would return true, but the mutated code would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(z['im'] - this['im'] + 1) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a constant value (`+ 1`) before the comparison. This could cause some cases where the original code would return true, but the mutated code would return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= (Complex['EPSILON'] * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the EPSILON constant by a factor (
