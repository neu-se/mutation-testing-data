Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the switch statement to evaluate to a case that does not exist (e.g., case 5), leading to the default case being executed even when there are exactly four arguments, which changes the expected behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause the switch statement to evaluate to a case that is one less than the actual number of arguments, which means that if there are three arguments, it will incorrectly execute the case for two arguments instead of the correct case for three.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always execute the case for zero arguments, which is not a valid case in the context of the function, leading to the default case being executed regardless of the actual number of arguments passed.

DONE.
