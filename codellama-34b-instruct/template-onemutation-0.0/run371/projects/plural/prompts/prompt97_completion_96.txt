  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of "a" with "e", while the new code fragment replaces the first occurrence of "o" with "e". This would cause the pluralization of "woman" to be incorrect.

DONE.
