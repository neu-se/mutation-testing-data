  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is NaN, while `!isNaN` checks if a value is not NaN. If the original code fragment is intended to check if a value is NaN, replacing it with `!isNaN` would cause the code to always return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is NaN. If the original code fragment is intended to check if a value is NaN, replacing it with `isFinite` would cause the code to always return the opposite result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN, while `isNaN` checks if a value is NaN. If the original code fragment is intended
