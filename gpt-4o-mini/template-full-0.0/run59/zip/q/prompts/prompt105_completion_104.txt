Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + this[index] + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from assigning the value of `this[index]` to `basis` to performing an addition operation, which would yield a different result than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of `this[index]` by 2 instead of assigning it directly to `basis`, which would lead to incorrect accumulation in the reduce function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `undefined` to `basis` instead of the current value of `this[index]`, effectively breaking the reduce functionality by not accumulating any values.

DONE.
