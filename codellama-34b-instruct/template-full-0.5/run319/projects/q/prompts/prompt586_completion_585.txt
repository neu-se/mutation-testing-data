  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
