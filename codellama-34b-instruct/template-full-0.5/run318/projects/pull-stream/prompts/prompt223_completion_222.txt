  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.isNot(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.isNot(test)` would return the opposite of `tester(test)`, which is not the same as `test(data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.not(test)` would return the opposite of `tester(test)`, which is not the same as `test(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.isFalse(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.isFalse(test)` would return `true` if `test` is `false`, but `test(data)` would return `true` if `data` is truthy.

DONE.
