  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000).fapply(object, ["delete", key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` will cause a delay of 1 second before `dispatch` is called, which will affect the timing of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object, which can behave differently from the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000).fapply(object, ["post", key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` will cause a delay of 1 second before `dispatch` is called, which will affect the timing of the operation, and "post" is a different operation than "delete".

DONE.
