  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument, whereas `Math.sin` returns the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the argument, whereas `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` return trigonometric functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, whereas `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` return trigonometric functions.

DONE.
