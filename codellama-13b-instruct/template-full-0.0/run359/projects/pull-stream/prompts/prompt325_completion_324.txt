  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be set to `true`, causing the `once` function to be called with `true` as the argument, which would result in the `onEnd` function being called with `null` as the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be set to `false`, causing the `once` function to not be called, which would result in the `onEnd` function not being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be set to `undefined`, causing the `once` function to not be called, which would result in the `onEnd` function not being called.

DONE.
