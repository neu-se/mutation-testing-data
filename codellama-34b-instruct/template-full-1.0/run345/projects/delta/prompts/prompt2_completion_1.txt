  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is an object. If `b` is an object, the replacement will evaluate to `true`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check if `b` is an object, while this replacement uses the `instanceof` operator. If `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, the replacement will evaluate to `true`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement uses
