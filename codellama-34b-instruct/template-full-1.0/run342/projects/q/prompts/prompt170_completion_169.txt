  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
line > 5
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `line` is an array and the expression `line > 5` would check if the first element of the array is greater than 5, while in the replacement code, `line` is a number and the expression `line > 5` would check if the number is greater than 5.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
line <= 5
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the expression `line > 5` would check if the first element of the array is greater than 5, while in the replacement code, the expression `line <= 5` would check if the number is less than or equal to 5.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
line[0] > 5
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the expression `line > 5` would check if the first element of
