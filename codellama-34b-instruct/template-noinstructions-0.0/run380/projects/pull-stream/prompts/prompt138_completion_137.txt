  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while the new code fragment always calls `cb` with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while the new code fragment always calls `cb` with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while the new code fragment always calls `cb` with a falsy value.

DONE.
