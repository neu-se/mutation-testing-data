  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of `s` to be a function, while this replacement only checks for strict equality with the string `'function'`. If `s` is a function, this replacement would return `true`, even if it's not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of `s` to be a function, while this replacement checks for the type of `s` to not be a function. If `s` is not a function, this replacement would return `true`, even if it's a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the type of `s` to be a function, while this replacement checks for `s` to be an instance of the `Function` constructor.
