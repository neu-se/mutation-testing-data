  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function from `clearTimeout`, and would not have the same effect on the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that sets a new timeout, rather than clearing an existing one. It would cause the timeout to be set again, which would not have the same effect as clearing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout than the one that was set. It would clear a timeout with an ID of `timeoutId + 1`, rather than the timeout with an ID of `timeoutId` that was set in the original code.

DONE.
