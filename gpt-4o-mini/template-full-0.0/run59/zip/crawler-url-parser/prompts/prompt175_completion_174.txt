Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extract(url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `extract` function instead of `parse`, which may not perform the same operations on the URL, potentially leading to incorrect parsing or extraction of URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, "http://example.com");
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a second argument to the `parse` function, which may change how the URL is processed, possibly leading to unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle a base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the second argument to the `parse` function, which may alter the parsing logic and lead to different outcomes compared to passing a valid base URL or omitting the second argument entirely.

DONE.
