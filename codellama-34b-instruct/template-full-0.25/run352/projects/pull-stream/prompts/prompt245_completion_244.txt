  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the logical AND operator. This would cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the logical NOT operator followed by the logical OR operator. This would cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, while this replacement uses the ternary operator. This would cause the `read` function to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to different behavior.

DONE.
