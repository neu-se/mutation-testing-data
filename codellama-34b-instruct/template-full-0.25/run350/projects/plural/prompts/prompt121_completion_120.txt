  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'ices') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment replaces the 'ics' ending with 'ices'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/ics$/i, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment replaces the 'ics' ending with 'es'.

DONE.
