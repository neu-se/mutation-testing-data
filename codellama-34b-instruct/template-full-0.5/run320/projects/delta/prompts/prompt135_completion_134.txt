  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next element, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the current element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek() + 1` would return the current element plus one, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek() - 1` would return the current element minus one, whereas `otherIter.peek()` returns the current element.

DONE.
