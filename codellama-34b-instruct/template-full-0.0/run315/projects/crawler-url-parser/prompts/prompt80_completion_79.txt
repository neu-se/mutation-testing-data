  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is used to get the value of an attribute, but the `href` attribute is not present in the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method is used to get the value of a property, but the `href` property is not present in the `a` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).data('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` method is used to get the value of a data attribute, but the `href` data attribute is not present in the `a` element.

DONE.
