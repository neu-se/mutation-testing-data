  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function rounds a number down to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round` function rounds a number to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.trunc` function removes the fractional part of a number, while `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

DONE.
