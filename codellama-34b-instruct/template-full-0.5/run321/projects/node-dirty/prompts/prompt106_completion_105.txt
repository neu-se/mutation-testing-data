  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `row.val`, which could cause the `set` method to store a different value than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `row.val`, which could cause the `set` method to store a different value than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `row.val` by 2, which could cause the `set` method to store a different value than the one intended.

DONE.
