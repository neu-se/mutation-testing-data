  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?:wo)?man$/i` matches the word "woman" but not "man".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?:wo)?man$/` matches the word "woman" but not "man" and is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?:wo)?man$/i` matches the word "woman" but not "man" and is case-insensitive.

DONE.
