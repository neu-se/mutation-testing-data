 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enforce strict mode, which could potentially cause issues with the existing code if it uses any implicit behavior or global variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.longStackSupport = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable long stack traces, which could potentially cause issues with the existing code if it is not designed to handle them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the built-in `Promise` object instead of the `Q` function, which could potentially cause issues with the existing code if it relies on the specific behavior of the `Q` function.

DONE.
