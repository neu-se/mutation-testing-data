  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `b`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to only return the attributes that are present in both `a` and `b`, rather than all the attributes that are present in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return all the attributes that are present in either `a` or `b`, rather than only the attributes that are present in `b`.

DONE.
