  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent` is a different object than `ctx`, and the `query` method of the `Rule` class may not expect to receive a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.otherProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.otherProperty` is a different property than `ctx`, and the `query` method of the `Rule` class may not expect to receive a different property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.otherProperty.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.otherProperty.parent` is a different object than `ctx`, and the `query` method of the `Rule` class may not expect to receive a different object.

DONE.
