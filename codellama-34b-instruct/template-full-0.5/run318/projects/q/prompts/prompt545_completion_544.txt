  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter would be passed as an argument to the `verb` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]();
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called without any arguments, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with two arguments, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
