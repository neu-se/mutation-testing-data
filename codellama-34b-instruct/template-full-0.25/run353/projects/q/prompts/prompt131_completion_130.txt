  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.bind(null)` would return a bound function that is not the same as the original `uncurryThis` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.call(null)` would call the `uncurryThis` function with a `this` value of `null`, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.apply(null)` would call the `uncurryThis` function with a `this` value of `null` and an empty arguments list, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the function.

DONE.
