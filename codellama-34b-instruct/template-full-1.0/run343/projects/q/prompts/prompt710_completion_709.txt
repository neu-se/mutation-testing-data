  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("POST", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `dispatch` method always use the "POST" method, regardless of the `name` and `args` parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("GET", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `dispatch` method always use the "GET" method, regardless of the `name` and `args` parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("PUT", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `dispatch` method always use the "PUT" method, regardless of the `name` and `args` parameters.

DONE.
