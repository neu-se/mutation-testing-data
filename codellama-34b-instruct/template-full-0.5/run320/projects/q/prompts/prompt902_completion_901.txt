  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function(){});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `fail` method that was not called with an error argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `fail` method that was called with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error returned by the `deferred.reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `fail` method that was called with the `deferred.resolve` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the
