 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the locally scoped `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` module passed in through the `options` object. This could cause issues if the behavior of `graceful-fs` and `fs` differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of the function, while the original code uses the asynchronous `fs.writeFile`. This could cause issues with the flow of the program, potentially causing it to hang or time out.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the synchronous `_fs.writeFileSync` instead of the asynchronous `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)`. This could cause issues with the flow of
