  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is the result of `URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)`, which is different from `parsedBaseUrl` which is the result of `URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `currentUrlStr` instead of `baseUrlStr` as the input for `URL.parse()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `baseUrlStr` instead of `currentUrlStr` as the input for `URL.parse()`.

DONE.
