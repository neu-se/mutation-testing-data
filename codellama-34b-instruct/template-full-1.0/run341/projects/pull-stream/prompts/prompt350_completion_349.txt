  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.toString()` always returns a string representation of the `prop` object, regardless of its contents, while `prop` may contain a function or a different type of object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.someOtherProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.someOtherProperty` may not exist, or may have a different value than `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test()` is a different method than `prop` and may have a different implementation.

DONE.
