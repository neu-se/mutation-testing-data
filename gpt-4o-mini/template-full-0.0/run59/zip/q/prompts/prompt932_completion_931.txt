Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which may lead to unexpected results when the function is called, as it would not behave the same way as `void 0` (which is strictly `undefined`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would refer to the current context of the Promise instance, potentially leading to errors if the context is not what the original function expects, unlike `void 0` which is always `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a falsy value, and it would change the expected behavior of the function, as it would not be equivalent to `void 0`, which is `undefined`.

DONE.
