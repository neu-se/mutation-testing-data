  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` is a function that reads the next chunk from the input stream, but it does not return a value. In contrast, `nextStream()` is a function that reads the next stream from the input stream and returns it as the result of the `flatten()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read()
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read()` is a function that reads the next chunk from the input stream, but it does not return a value. In contrast, `nextStream()` returns the result of the `values()` function, which is a stream of arrays or streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns a stream of arrays or streams, but it does not read the next chunk from the input stream. In contrast, `nextChunk()` reads the next chunk from the input stream and returns it
