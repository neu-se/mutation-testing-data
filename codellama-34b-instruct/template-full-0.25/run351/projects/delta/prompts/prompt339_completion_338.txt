  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip over the next operation in the delta, potentially resulting in incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to go back to the previous operation in the delta, potentially resulting in incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to stay on the same operation in the delta, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
