  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that closes the stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream. Closing the stream would cause the `end` event to be emitted, which would trigger the `close` event on the write stream, whereas destroying the stream would cause the `close` event to be emitted on the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` takes an optional `error` argument that is used to signal an error condition. In this case, the `error` argument is passed as a new `Error` object with the message "Test error". This would cause the `error` event to be emitted on the write stream, whereas the original code does not pass an `error` argument to `destroy()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
