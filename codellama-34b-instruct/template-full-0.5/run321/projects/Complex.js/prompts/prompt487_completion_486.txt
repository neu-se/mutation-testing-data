  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.toVector = function() {
  return [this.re, this.im];
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an array with the real and imaginary parts, while this modified code returns an array with only the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.valueOf = function() {
  return this.re;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the real part of the complex number, while this modified code returns the absolute value of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isNaN = function() {
  return this.re === 0 && this.im === 0;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while this modified code checks if the complex number is zero.

DONE.
