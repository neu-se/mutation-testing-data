  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ops` is an array and has a length greater than 0, whereas the original code only checks if `ops` is an array. This change would cause the code to throw an error if `ops` is not an array or has a length of 0, which is not the intended behavior.
