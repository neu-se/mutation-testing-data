  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, at)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not remove the reason from the unhandledReasons array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two elements from the unhandledReasons array instead of just one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the unhandledReasons array instead of just the one at the specified index.

DONE.
