  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allSettled" is a different method from "allResolved" that returns a promise for an array of promises, which may result in different behavior in the context of the `allResolved` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because "any" is a different method from "allResolved" that returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array, which may result in different behavior in the context of the `allResolved` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because "all" is a different method from "allResolved" that returns a promise for an array of promises, which may result in different behavior in the context of the `allResolved` method.

DONE.
