  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message = "INTENTIONAL ERROR";
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be modified, which could change the behavior of any code that depends on the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve("INTENTIONAL VALUE");
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a different value, which could change the behavior of any code that depends on the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("INTENTIONAL ERROR");
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error, which could change the behavior of any code that depends on the rejected error.

DONE.
