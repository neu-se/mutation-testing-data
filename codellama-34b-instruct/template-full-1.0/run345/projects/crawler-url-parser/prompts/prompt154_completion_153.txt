  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would make it match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a different pattern than the original, specifically it matches any character ('.') one or more times ('+') followed by the original pattern.

DONE.
