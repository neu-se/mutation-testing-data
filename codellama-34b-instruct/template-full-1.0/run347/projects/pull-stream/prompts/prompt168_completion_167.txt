  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return 0, regardless of the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return null, regardless of the input array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return an empty array, regardless of the input array.

DONE.
