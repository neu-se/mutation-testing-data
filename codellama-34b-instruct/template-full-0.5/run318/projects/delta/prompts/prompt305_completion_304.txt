  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length()` would always be a non-negative integer, so the condition would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true if the line is empty, but the original code fragment would only execute the `predicate` function if the line is non-empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true if the line is non-empty, but the original code fragment would only execute the `predicate` function if the line is empty.

DONE.
