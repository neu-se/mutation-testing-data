  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the literal string "$1" instead of the first capturing group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\' + $1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the literal string "\$1" instead of the first capturing group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire string instead of the first capturing group.

DONE.
