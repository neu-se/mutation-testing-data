  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of plus and minus signs is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if the number of plus and minus signs is equal to 0 or if the current character is NaN. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when the input string contains a NaN character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of plus and minus signs is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if the number of plus and minus signs is equal to 0 and the current character is not NaN. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when the input string contains a NaN character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && is
