  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toPrecision
```
This would result in different behavior because `toPrecision` returns a string representing the number in fixed-point or exponential notation rounded to `precision` significant digits, while `toFixed` returns a string representing the number in fixed-point notation rounded to `precision` decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toExponential
```
This would result in different behavior because `toExponential` returns a string representing the number in exponential notation with one digit before the decimal point and `precision` digits after the decimal point, while `toFixed` returns a string representing the number in fixed-point notation with `precision` decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `toFixed` with a precision of `precision + 1` would round the number to `precision + 1` decimal
