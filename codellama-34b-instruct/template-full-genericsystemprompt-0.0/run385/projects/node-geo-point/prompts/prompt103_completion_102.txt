  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the ending point, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude of the ending point, which would result in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 180 degrees from the longitude of the ending point, which would result in a different destination point.

DONE.
