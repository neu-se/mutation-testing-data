  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).send
```
This would result in different behavior because the `send` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).post
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
