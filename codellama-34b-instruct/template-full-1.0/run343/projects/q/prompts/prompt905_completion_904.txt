  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` and `arguments` are used in a different order than in the original code, which is `nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments);`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(arguments).slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is not an array and `Q.slice()` would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(arguments).then(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is not array-like and cannot be used with `Q.all()`, and `array_slice` is not a function that can be called on a promise.

DONE.
