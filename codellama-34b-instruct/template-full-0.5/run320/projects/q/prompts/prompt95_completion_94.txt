  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because `++index` would increment `index` by 1 before comparing it to `length`, whereas `++index >= length` would increment `index` by 1 only if it is less than or equal to `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index++` would increment `index` by 1 after comparing it to `length`, whereas `++index >= length` would increment `index` by 1 before comparing it to `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index + 1` would add 1 to `index` before comparing it to `length`, whereas `++index >= length` would increment `index` by 1 before comparing it to `length`.

DONE.
