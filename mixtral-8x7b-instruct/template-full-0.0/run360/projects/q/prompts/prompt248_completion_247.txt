 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.split("\n").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of lines in the stack trace, instead of the index of the first line break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1, regardless of the length of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.indexOf("\r") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a carriage return (`\r`) instead of a line feed (`\n`), which may not exist in the stack trace.

DONE.
