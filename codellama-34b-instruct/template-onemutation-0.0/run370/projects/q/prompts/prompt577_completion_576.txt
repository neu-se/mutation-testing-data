  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is a JavaScript keyword that is used to throw an exception, whereas "next" is a string that is not a valid JavaScript keyword. In the context of the code, "throw" would cause the generator to throw an exception, whereas "next" would cause the generator to continue to the next iteration.
