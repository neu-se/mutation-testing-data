  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverTimezones` is a different function than `deliverCountry`, and it would return a different set of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesForCountry` is a different function than `deliverCountry`, and it would return a different set of timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountryForTimezone` is a different function than `deliverCountry`, and it would return a different set of countries.

DONE.
