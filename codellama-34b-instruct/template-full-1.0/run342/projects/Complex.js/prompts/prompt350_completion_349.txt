  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 is added to the complex number, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of a is multiplied by 2, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the complex number is flipped, which changes the result of the calculation.

DONE.
