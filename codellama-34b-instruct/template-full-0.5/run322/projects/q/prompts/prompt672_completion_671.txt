  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the resolved value, rather than the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the rejected value, rather than the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.never()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.never()` returns a promise that never settles, which would cause the `dispatch` method to never be called.

DONE.
