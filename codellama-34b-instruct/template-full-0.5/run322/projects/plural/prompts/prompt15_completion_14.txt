  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be reduced by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be reduced by 3 instead of 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be reduced by 4 instead of 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

DONE.
