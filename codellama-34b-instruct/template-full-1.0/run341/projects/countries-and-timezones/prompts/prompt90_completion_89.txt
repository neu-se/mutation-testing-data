  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(undefined, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with the `id` argument set to `undefined`, which would likely cause it to return `undefined`, instead of a valid country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(tzName + '_', options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a modified `id` argument that is not a valid country code, which would likely cause it to return `undefined`, instead of a valid country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(options.country, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a different `id` argument that is not a valid country code, which would likely cause it to return `undefined`, instead of a valid country object.

DONE.
