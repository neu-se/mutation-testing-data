  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be multiplied by the places value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be added to the places value, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the places value to be subtracted by the complex number, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
