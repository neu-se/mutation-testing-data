Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the `array_slice` function from 1 to 0, which would include the first argument in the resulting array instead of excluding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the `array_slice` function from 1 to 1, which would effectively return an empty array if there are no additional arguments beyond the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the slicing to start from the last argument instead of the second argument, which would result in only the last argument being included in the resolved value.

DONE.
