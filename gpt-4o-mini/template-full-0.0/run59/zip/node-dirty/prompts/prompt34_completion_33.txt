Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(() => { if (cb) cb('error'); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback to always pass an error string instead of calling the original callback, which may lead to unhandled errors in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, null, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` instead of deleting the key from the `_data` map, which means the key will still exist in the database but with a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, 'deleted', cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value associated with the key to the string `'deleted'` instead of removing the key, which could lead to confusion about the state of the data stored in the database.

DONE.
