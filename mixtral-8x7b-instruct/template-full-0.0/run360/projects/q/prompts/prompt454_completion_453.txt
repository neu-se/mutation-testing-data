 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"<no stack>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison with other error stacks would not include the space character after "<no".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the error object to a string, losing the stack trace information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the error message with null, which would not provide any information about the error.

DONE.
