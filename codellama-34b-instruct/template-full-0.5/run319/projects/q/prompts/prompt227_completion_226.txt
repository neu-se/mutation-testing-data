  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if `messages` is an empty array, whereas `messages` would only be truthy if it has elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!messages.length` would only be truthy if `messages` is an empty array, whereas `messages` would be truthy even if it has elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` would only be truthy if `messages` has at least one element, whereas `messages` would be truthy even if it's empty.

DONE.
