Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first argument instead of all the arguments passed, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when multiple arguments are expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first argument and only includes the rest, which may cause the function to miss important data that was intended to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 0 ? [arguments[0]] : []
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array with the first argument only if it exists, otherwise it returns an empty array, which could lead to unexpected results when no arguments are provided.

DONE.
