  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `this._waitForDrain`, causing the `break` statement to be executed unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment operation would set `this._waitForDrain` to `false`, causing the `break` statement to be executed unconditionally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment operation would set `this._waitForDrain` to `true`, causing the `break` statement to be executed unconditionally.

DONE.
