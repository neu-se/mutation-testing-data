  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `recursive` option set to `true`, which would include all subdirectories and files in the archive, whereas the original code fragment only included the files in the top-level directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { ignore: ['**/*.js'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `ignore` option set to ignore all JavaScript files, whereas the original code fragment did not have any ignore options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { dot: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `dot` option set to `true`, which would include hidden files and directories in the archive, whereas the original code fragment did not have any dot option.

DONE.
