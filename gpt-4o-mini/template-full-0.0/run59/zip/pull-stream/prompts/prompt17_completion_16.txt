Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read + ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from calling the `pull` function to performing an addition operation, which may lead to unexpected results if `read` and `ref[0]` are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a duplicate argument (`ref[0]`) instead of calling `pull` with the intended arguments, potentially altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the first argument (`ref[0]`) and only passes the second argument to the `pull` function, which may lead to incorrect processing of the input.

DONE.
