  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` will return the next operation object in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next(opLength)` will return the next `opLength` operations objects in the iterator. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, especially if the `opLength` is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` will return the next operation object in the iterator, but it will not advance the iterator. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, especially if the `opLength` is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.slice(0, opLength))
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.slice(0, opLength)` will return an iterator that iter
