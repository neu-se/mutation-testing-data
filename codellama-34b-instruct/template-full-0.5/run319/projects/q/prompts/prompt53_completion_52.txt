  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" &&
        process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.nextTick` property is being checked for the value `undefined`, which would cause the `nextTick` function to be overwritten with a new function that does not use `process.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" &&
        process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick !== undefined
```
