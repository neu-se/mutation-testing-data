  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `insert` type is missing, which would cause the function to retain the `delete` operation, rather than deleting it as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `delete` type is missing, which would cause the function to retain the `insert` operation, rather than inserting it as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for the length of the current operation is not correct, which would cause the function to retain more or less characters than expected, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
