  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node-style callback, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the provided value, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node-style callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the provided reason, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node-style callback.

DONE.
