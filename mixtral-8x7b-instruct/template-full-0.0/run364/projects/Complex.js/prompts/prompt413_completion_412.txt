 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log1p
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log1p` calculates the natural logarithm of (1 + x), instead of directly using `Math.log` which calculates the natural logarithm of x. This change may cause issues when the input is negative or zero, as `Math.log1p` does not support them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` calculates the base-2 logarithm of a number, instead of the natural logarithm. This change would affect the output values, making them different from the original results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` calculates the base-10 logarithm of a number, instead of the natural logarithm. This
