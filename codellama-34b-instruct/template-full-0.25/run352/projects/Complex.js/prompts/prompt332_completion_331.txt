  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for greater than. This would cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for less than. This would cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new fragment checks for inequality. This would cause the function to return a different value for certain inputs.

DONE.
