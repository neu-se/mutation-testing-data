  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` and `any` are different methods in the Q library, and they have different behavior when it comes to handling rejected promises. `all` will reject the promise if any of the input promises are rejected, while `any` will only reject the promise if all of the input promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is not a method in the Q library, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is not a method in the Q library, and it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
