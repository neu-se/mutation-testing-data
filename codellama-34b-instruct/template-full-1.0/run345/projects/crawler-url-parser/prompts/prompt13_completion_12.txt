  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would no longer be prefixed with "http://" if it is a relative URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be prefixed with "https://" even if it is a relative URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://' + parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL would be prefixed with "https://" followed by the pathname of the URL, even if it is a relative URL.

DONE.
