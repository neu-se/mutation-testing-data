  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` is a pending promise, whereas `Q` is a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply([])` is a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a resolved promise.

DONE.
