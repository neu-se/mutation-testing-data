  Sure, here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.path` includes the query string and hash, while `pageurl.pathname` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.href` includes the entire URL, while `pageurl.path` only includes the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.match(/^\/([^\/]+)/i)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches only the first segment of the URL path, while `pageurl.path` matches the entire URL path.

DONE.
