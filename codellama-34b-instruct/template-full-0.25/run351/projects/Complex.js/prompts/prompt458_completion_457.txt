  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `this['isInfinite']`, so the resulting code would return `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole, and `false` if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole, but it does not check if it is at the zero pole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` checks if the complex number is not a number, but it does not check if it is at the infinity or zero pole.

DONE.
