  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 1, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is an object and has a length of 1. If `a` is a function, the original code fragment would return `true`, but the new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 1, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is a function and has a length of 2. If `a` is a function with a length of 1, the original code fragment would return `true`, but the new code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
