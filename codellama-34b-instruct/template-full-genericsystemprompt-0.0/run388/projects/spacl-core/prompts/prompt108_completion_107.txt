  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different property than `ctx`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.verb` is a different property than `ctx`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.name` is a different property than `ctx`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

DONE.
