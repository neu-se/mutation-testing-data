Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve("Error handled");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the new exception, it resolves the promise with a string indicating that the error was handled, which changes the promise's state from rejected to fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("Custom error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a custom error message instead of the original exception, which could lead to different error handling in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a `null` value instead of the original exception, which may cause confusion in the error handling logic since it does not provide any meaningful error information.

DONE.
