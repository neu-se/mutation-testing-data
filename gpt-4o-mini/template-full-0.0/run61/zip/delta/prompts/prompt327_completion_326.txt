Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of pushing the base operation into the inverted Delta, it retains the length of the base operation, potentially losing the actual operation data and altering the intended structure of the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push({ insert: null });
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes an operation with a null insert value into the inverted Delta, which may not represent the intended operation and could lead to incorrect transformations or data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the length of the base operation instead of pushing it, which would remove data from the inverted Delta rather than adding it, leading to an incorrect representation of the operations.

DONE.
