  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`. In the original code, the `deprecated` property is only used when the `options` object is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`. In the original code, the `options` object is only used when it is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `options` object if it is not empty and has a `deprecated` property that is `true`, and `null` otherwise. In the original code, the `options` object is only
