  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to return an array of stack trace frames instead of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `defer` function to return a resolved promise instead of an unresolved one.

DONE.
