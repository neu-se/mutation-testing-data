  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is removed, causing the regular expression to match only lowercase "man" and not "Woman" or "woman".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, causing the regular expression to match "man", "Woman", and "woman" regardless of case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, causing the regular expression to match "man", "Woman", and "woman" regardless of case.

DONE.
