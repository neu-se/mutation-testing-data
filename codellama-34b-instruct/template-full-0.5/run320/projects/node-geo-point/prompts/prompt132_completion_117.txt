  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile()` method would receive a `null` value as its first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile()` method would receive a new `GeoPoint` object with zero latitude and longitude values, which would likely cause the method to return a different tile than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile()` method would receive a new value that is the sum of the latitude and longitude values, which would likely cause the method to return a different tile than the original code fragment.

DONE.
