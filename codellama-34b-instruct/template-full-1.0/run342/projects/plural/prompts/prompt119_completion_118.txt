  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ies$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ics$/i` matches words that end with "ics", while the regular expression `/ies$/i` matches words that end with "ies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/iks$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ics$/i` matches words that end with "ics", while the regular expression `/iks$/i` matches words that end with "iks".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ics$/i` is case-insensitive, while the regular expression `/ics$/` is case-sensitive.

DONE.
