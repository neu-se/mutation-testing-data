  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the value rather than the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the key in the current object rather than the key in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the next key in the array rather than the current key.

DONE.
