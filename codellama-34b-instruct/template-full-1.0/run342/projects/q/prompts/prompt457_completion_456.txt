  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledPromises
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledPromises` is a different variable from `unhandledRejections`, and it may contain a different set of promises that have been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejectionHandlers.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejectionHandlers` is a different variable that contains the number of rejection handlers that have been added to the promise, rather than the number of rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * unhandledRejections.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select an unhandled rejection from the list, rather than simply checking if the promise is in the list.

DONE.
