  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ses.makeQ` function to be defined, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ses.makeQ` function to not be defined, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() && ses.makeQ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ses.makeQ` function to be defined only if `ses.ok()` returns `true`, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
