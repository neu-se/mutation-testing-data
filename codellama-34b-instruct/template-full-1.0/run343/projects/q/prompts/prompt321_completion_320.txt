  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.race = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` method is used to create a race condition between promises, and setting it to `null` would prevent that from happening.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.race = reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` method is used to create a race condition between promises, and setting it to `reject` would cause the race condition to fail immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.race = function (x, y) { return x + y; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` method is used to create a race condition between promises, and setting it to a function that adds its arguments together would cause the race condition to succeed with a different result.

DONE.
