  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function once, while this modified code fragment calls it multiple times, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function for each element in the `cbs` array, while this modified code fragment only calls it for the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function for each element in the `cbs` array, while this modified code fragment only calls it for the last element.

DONE.
