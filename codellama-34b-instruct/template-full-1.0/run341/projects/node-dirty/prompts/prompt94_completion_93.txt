  Sure, I can do that! Here are three options for mutating the original code fragment `JSON.parse(rowStr)`:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(rowStr, (key, val) => val + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `val` before parsing it as JSON, which would cause the output to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(rowStr, (key, val) => val * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the value of `val` by 2 before parsing it as JSON, which would cause the output to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(rowStr, (key, val) => val.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the value of `val` to uppercase before parsing it as JSON
