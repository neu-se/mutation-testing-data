  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin verschillend
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin verschillend` is not a valid trigonometric function and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos verschillend
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos verschillend` would return a different value than `sin`, even though the input values are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(π)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(π)` would return `0` instead of a non-zero value, which could cause a divide-by-zero error or have other unexpected results.

DONE.
