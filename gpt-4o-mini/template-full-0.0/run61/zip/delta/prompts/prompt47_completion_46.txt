Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the variable `b` instead of `a`, leading to a potential mismatch in the expected embed type and causing the function to throw an error when it shouldn't.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the embed type of `a` instead of `b`, which could lead to a situation where the embed types are incorrectly compared, potentially allowing mismatched types to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `b` has no keys, which would incorrectly allow the function to proceed without validating that the embed types match, leading to unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
