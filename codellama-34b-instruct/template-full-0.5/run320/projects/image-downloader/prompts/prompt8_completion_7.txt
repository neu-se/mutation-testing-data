  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present in the destination path, while the new code fragment checks if the file extension is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present in the destination path, while the new code fragment checks if the file extension is present in the parent directory of the destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present in the destination path, while the new code fragment checks if the file extension is present in the basename of the destination path.

DONE.
