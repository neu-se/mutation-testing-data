  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in a string, while `length` returns the length of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in a string, while `length` returns the length of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.indexOf(otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in a string, while `length` returns the length of a string.

DONE.
