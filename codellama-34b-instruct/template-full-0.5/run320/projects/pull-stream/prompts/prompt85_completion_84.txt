  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `function () {}` if `cb` is truthy, rather than `cb` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `function () {}` if `cb` is truthy, and `null` if it is falsy, rather than `cb` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `?` operator, so the expression would evaluate to `function () {}` if `cb` is falsy, rather than `null` if it is fals
