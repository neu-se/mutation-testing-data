 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.cosh` would attempt to access the `cosh` property of the current object, while `cosh` is a standalone function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp.bind(null, this['re']) + Math.exp.bind(null, -this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `e^a + e^-a` using `Math.exp` and `bind`, while `cosh(a)` is a more optimized way of calculating the same value.

DONE.
