  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error if the input is invalid, rather than returning `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `NaN` if the input is invalid, rather than throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Infinity` if the input is invalid, rather than throwing an error.

DONE.
