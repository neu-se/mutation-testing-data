  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of the promise by 2, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value - 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the value.

DONE.
