 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+ '
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison will now require a space after the '+' character, which might not be present in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.startsWith('+')
