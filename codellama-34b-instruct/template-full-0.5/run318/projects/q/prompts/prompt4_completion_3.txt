  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a constant value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a null value.

DONE.
