Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `makeNodeResolver`, which may alter how the resolver behaves, potentially causing it to resolve with a value of `true` instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `makeNodeResolver` could lead to the resolver not being properly set up, which may cause the promise to never resolve or reject, leading to unhandled promise states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` may cause the resolver to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a situation where the promise does not resolve correctly, similar to passing `null`, but with different implications in how the promise chain is handled.

DONE.
