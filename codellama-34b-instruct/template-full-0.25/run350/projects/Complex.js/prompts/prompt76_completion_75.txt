  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one additional time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
