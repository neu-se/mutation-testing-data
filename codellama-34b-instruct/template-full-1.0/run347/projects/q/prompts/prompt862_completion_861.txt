  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object.delay(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `delay` method on the `object` itself, which may not exist or have different behavior than the original `delay` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(timeout).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with the `timeout` value and then call the `delay` method on that promise, which would delay the resolution of the promise by the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `delay` method on the `Promise` constructor itself, which would delay the resolution of the promise by the specified timeout.

DONE.
