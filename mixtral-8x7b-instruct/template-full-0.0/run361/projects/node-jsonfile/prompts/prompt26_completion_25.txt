 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `options` object has a `reviver` property set to `null`, the `JSON.parse()` method will not use a reviver function, and the parsed object may not have the expected structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty reviver function would be used, which could lead to the parsed object having a different structure than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'123'
