  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment plural(word, num) would return a string, while the replaced code fragment 1 would return a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment plural(word, num) would return a string, while the replaced code fragment null would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment plural(word, num) would return a string, while the replaced code fragment "hello" would return a string "hello".

DONE.
