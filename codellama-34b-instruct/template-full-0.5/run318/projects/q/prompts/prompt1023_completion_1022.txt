  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `Q(object).nodeify` is a method that returns a value or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).catch` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `Q(object).nodeify` is a method that returns a value or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).finally` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `Q(object).nodeify` is a method that returns a value or an error.

DONE.
