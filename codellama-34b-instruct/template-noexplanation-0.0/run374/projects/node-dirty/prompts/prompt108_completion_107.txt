  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `buffer` is empty, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length > 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `buffer` is not empty, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 1
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `buffer` has exactly one element, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
