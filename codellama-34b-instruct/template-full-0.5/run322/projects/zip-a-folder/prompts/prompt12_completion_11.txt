  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` constant is not present in the original code, which could cause the test to pass even if the file is not writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` constant is not present in the original code, which could cause the test to pass even if the file is not executable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.F_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.F_OK` constant is not present in the original code, which could cause the test to pass
