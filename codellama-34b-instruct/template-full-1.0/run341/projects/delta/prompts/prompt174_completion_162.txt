  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `super.peekLength()` would refer to the method `peekLength()` of the superclass, which may return a different value than `thisIter.peekLength()`, which is the method of the same name in the current class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.length` would refer to the length of the other iterator, not the length of the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the current iterator, which could result in a negative number if the length is 0 or 1.

DONE.
