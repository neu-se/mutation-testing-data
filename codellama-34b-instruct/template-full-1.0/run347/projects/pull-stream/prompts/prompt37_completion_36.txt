  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in a different behavior because ref[4] will be undefined in the original code, while ref[3] is defined as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in a different behavior because ref[3] will be skipped and never used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in a different behavior because ref[3] will be used before ref[0], which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
