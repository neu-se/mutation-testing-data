  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.slice(1)` returns a new string that is a substring of the original string, starting from the second character. In contrast, `str` refers to the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.split('.')[0]` splits the string into an array of substrings using the period (`.`) as the separator, and then returns the first element in the array. In contrast, `str` refers to the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.toUpperCase()` converts the string to uppercase, while `str` refers to the original string.

DONE.
