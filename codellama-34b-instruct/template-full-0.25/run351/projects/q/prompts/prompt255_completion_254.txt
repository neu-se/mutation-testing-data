  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` variable is an array, and `message[0]` would be the first element of the array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.length` would be the number of elements in the `message` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.pop()` would remove and return the last element of the `message` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
