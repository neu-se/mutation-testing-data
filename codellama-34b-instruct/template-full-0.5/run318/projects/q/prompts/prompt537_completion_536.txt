  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not an array, so the `spread` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not an array, so the `spread` method would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty array `[]` does not have a `then` method, so the `spread` method would throw an error.

DONE.
