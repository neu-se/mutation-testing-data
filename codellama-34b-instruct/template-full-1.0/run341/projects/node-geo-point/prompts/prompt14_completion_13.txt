  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof (point.coordinates) === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point.coordinates` is an array, while this modified code checks if it is undefined. If `point.coordinates` is not an array, the original code would throw a `TypeError` while the modified code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point.coordinates` has two elements, while this modified code checks if it has fewer than two elements. If `point.coordinates` has fewer than two elements, the original code would throw a `RangeError` while the modified code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `point.co
