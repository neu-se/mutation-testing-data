  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the callback function `cb` when the value is undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the callback function `cb` when the value is undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the callback function `cb` when the value is undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
