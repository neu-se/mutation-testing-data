  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path. In the original code, the intention is to extract the filename from the URL, which is achieved by using `path.basename`. Replacing `path.extname` with `path.basename` would cause the code to fail to extract the filename correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the parent directory of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path. In the original code, the intention is to extract the filename from the URL, which is achieved by using `path.basename`. Replacing `path.extname` with `path.dirname` would cause the code to fail to extract the filename correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
