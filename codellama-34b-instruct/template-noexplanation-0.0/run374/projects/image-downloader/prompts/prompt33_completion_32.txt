  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This code fragment is a function call that resumes the reading of the response data. It is similar to the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior in the case where the response data is not consumed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This code fragment is a function call that destroys the response object, which can cause the request to fail. It is different from the original code fragment, which only consumes the response data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('data', () => {});
```
This code fragment is an event listener that listens for the 'data' event on the response object. It is similar to the original code fragment, but it does not consume the response data.

DONE.
