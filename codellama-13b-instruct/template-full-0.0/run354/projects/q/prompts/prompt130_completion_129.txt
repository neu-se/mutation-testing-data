  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the new code fragment is a string literal. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a variable name and not a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is a different variable name than the original code fragment. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a specific variable name and not a different one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment is a string concatenation of a variable name and a number. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a variable name and not a string concatenation.

DONE.
