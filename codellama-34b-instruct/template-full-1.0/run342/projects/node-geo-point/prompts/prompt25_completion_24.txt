  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'long'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'long' is a valid property name, but it does not refer to the longitude value that is expected in the context of the `fromObject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'latitude' is a valid property name, but it does not refer to the longitude value that is expected in the context of the `fromObject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator (`%`) causes the longitude value to be wrapped around to the range 0 to 360, which is not the same as the original longitude value.

DONE.
