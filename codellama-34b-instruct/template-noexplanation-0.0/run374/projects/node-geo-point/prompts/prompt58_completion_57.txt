  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the wrong value, as it will calculate the bearing between the two points using the cosine of the angle between them, rather than the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the wrong value, as it will calculate the bearing between the two points using the tangent of the angle between them, rather than the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the wrong value, as it will calculate the bearing between the two points using the arccosine of the angle between them, rather than the sine.

DONE.
