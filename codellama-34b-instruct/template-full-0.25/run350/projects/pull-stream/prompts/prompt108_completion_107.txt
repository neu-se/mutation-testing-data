  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if `cb` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `acc` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if `acc` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `sink` is falsy, while this new fragment checks if `sink` is strictly equal to `null`.

DONE.
