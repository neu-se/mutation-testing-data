  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` variable is not an object, so the expression will always evaluate to `false`, even if `process.emit` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression checks if `process.emit` is not a function, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression checks if `process.emit` is undefined, which is different from checking if it is a function.

DONE.
