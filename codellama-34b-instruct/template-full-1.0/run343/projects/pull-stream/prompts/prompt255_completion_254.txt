  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `nextStream` once, but the mutated code calls it twice, which could result in unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `_read` with two arguments, but the mutated code only passes the `abort` argument, which could result in unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `nextChunk` with one argument, but the mutated code passes two arguments, which could result in unintended side effects.

DONE.
