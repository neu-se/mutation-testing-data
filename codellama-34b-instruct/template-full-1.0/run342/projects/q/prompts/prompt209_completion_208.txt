  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because <PLACEHOLDER> is a string value, and using the bind method will result in errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback[<PLACEHOLDER>](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because <PLACEHOLDER> is a syntax error and cannot be used as a property accessor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(null, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because <PLACEHOLDER> is a string value, and using a null value as the first argument would result in an error.

DONE.
