  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete spec;
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec` will be deleted from the code, causing errors when it is later referenced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const spec = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object will be assigned to `spec`, causing the code to behave differently when `spec` is used as a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const spec = "hello";
```
This would result in different behavior because a string literal will be assigned to `spec`, causing the code to behave differently when `spec` is used as a regular expression.

DONE.
