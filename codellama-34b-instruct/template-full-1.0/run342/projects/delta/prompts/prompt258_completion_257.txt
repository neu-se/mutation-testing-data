  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are opposite operations, so the transformed delta would have a different meaning than the original one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` refers to a different operation than `thisOp`, so the transformed delta would have a different meaning than the original one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different operation than `insert`, so the transformed delta would have a different meaning than the original one.

DONE.
