  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to the word, while this new code fragment adds 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to the word, while this new code fragment adds 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 'es' to the word, while this new code fragment adds 'es' and 's'.

DONE.
