  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space. This change would cause the `parse` function to produce different results for URLs that contain a `#` character.

DONE.
