  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(c => getCountry(c, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, `filter` would only return the countries that have a timezone with the given name, whereas `map` would return all countries and their timezones.
