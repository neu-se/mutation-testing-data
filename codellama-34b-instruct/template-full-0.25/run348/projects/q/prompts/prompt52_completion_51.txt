  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    process.nextTick(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.nextTick` function is not defined in the browser environment, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is not guaranteed to execute the `flush` function immediately, and may introduce a delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    flush();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would be called immediately, without waiting for the next tick of the event loop.

DONE.
