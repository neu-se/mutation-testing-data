  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the next element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the previous element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the element at a different index in the array.

DONE.
