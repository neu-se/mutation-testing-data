  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so it would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, so it would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `undefined` in this case. This new promise would not be tracked as an unhandled rejection.

DONE.
