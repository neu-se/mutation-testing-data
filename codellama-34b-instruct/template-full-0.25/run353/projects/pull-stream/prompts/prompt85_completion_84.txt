  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be `&&` with `cb`. If `cb` is truthy, the result would be `function () {}`, otherwise it would be `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be `?` with `cb`. If `cb` is truthy, the result would be `function () {}`, otherwise it would be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `?
