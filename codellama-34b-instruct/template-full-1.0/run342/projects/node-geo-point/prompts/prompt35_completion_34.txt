  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could potentially lead to a different result in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a constant value instead of the variable `point1Rad`, which could potentially lead to a different result in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude of the two points together instead of using the difference between them, which could potentially lead to a different result in the calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
