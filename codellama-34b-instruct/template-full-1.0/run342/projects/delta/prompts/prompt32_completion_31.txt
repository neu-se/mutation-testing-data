  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] = b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `attr[key]` unconditionally, even if `b[key]` is undefined. In the original code, the value is only assigned if `a[key]` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] = (a[key] === undefined ? b[key] : a[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a ternary operator to assign the value of `b[key]` to `attr[key]` if `a[key]` is undefined, but it would assign the value of `a[key]` to `attr[key]` otherwise. In the original code, the value is only assigned if `a[key]` is undefined.

Option 3
