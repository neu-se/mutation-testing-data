  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are functions that are used to resolve or reject a promise, respectively. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved, which would result in a different outcome than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected. Using `throw new Error("rejected")` instead of `reject` would result in a different exception being thrown, which would also result in a different outcome than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the specified exception. Using `return Q.reject(exception)` instead of `reject
