  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('text');
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the 'text' attribute of the element instead of the text content of the element, which could be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the 'href' attribute of the element instead of the text content of the element, which could be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html();
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the HTML content of the element instead of the text content, which could be different.

DONE.
