  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the opposite of the original abs function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of a, which would change the result of the abs function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to a, which would change the result of the abs function.

DONE.
