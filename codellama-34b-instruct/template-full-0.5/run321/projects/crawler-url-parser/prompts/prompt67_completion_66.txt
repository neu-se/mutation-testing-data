  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` parameter of the `URL.parse()` method is now a string, and the `split()` method is called on a string, which would produce a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` parameter of the `URL.parse()` method is now a string, and the `split()` method is called on a string, which would produce a different result than the original code.
