  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `terminate` function to be called even if `ended` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `terminate` function to be called if `ended` is true, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `terminate` function to be called if `ended` and `end` are both true, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
