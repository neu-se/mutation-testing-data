  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so `pull.apply(undefined, ref)` would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, so `null.source` would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `s` is a function, so `s.source` would throw an error.

DONE.
