  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cosh` have different output values for the same input. For example, `sin(0) = 0`, but `cosh(0) = 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` takes the absolute value of the input, while `cosh` takes the hyperbolic cosine of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / Math.cos(x)` is the inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) of `x`, while `cosh(x)` is the hyperbolic cosine of `x`.

DONE.
