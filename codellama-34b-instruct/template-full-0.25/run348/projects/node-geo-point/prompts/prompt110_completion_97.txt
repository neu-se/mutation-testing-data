  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.log` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.sin` in place of `Math.log` would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.log` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.cos` in place of `Math.log` would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.log` have different mathematical properties, and using `Math.tan` in place of `Math.log` would cause the calculation of the tile coordinates to be incorrect.

DONE.
