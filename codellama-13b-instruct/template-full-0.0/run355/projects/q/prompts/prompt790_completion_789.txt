  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a function as its second argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` when the `finally` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a function as its second argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` when the `finally` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a promise as its second argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` when the `finally` method is called.

DONE.
