  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
event, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `event` is not an error, while the original code fragment only listens for the `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'something-else', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `something-else` is not the `error` event, which is the only event that is currently being listened for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is not the function that handles the `error` event, which is the only event that is currently being listened for.

DONE.
