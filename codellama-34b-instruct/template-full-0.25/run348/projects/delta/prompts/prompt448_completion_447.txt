  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `op` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `op` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `op` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `op` is greater than or equal to 0.

DONE.
