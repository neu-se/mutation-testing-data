  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is being called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { deprecated: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is being called with a different set of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
