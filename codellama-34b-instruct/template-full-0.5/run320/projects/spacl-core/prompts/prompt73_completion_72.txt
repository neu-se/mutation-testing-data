  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ctx` object directly, while the modified code fragment uses a clone of the `ctx` object. This could cause the policy's `query` method to behave differently when the `ctx` object is modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `ctx` object, while the modified code fragment adds 1 to the `ctx` object before passing it to the `query` method. This could cause the policy's `query` method to behave differently when the `ctx` object is modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `ctx` object, while the modified code fragment multiplies the
