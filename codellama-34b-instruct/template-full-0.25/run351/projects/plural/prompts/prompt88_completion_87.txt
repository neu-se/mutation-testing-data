  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'people'`, which is the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'person'`, which is the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'people'`, which is the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'persons'`, which is the plural form of the word with an additional `s` at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'humans'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'people'`, which is the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'humans'`, which is a different plural form of the word.

DONE.
