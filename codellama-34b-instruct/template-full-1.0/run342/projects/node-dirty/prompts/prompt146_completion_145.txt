  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener for the `error` event would be called instead of the `drain` event listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event listener for the `close` event would be called instead of the `drain` event listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as it simply refers to the `drain` event.

DONE.
