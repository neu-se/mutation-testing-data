  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.sum
```
This would result in different behavior because `sum` is not a property of the `part` object, but `slice` is. This would cause an error when trying to use the `sum` method on `part`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(':.+', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is not a property of the `part` object, but `slice` is. This would cause an error when trying to use the `replace` method on `part`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `trim` is not a property of the `part` object, but `slice` is. This would cause an error when trying to use the `trim` method on `part`.

DONE.
