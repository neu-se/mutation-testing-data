Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to false, leading to the assumption that the current complex number is not infinite, which could result in incorrect calculations when one of the complex numbers is actually infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, potentially allowing operations that should not be valid (like adding zero to infinity) to proceed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second complex number (z) is zero instead of checking if the first complex number (this) is infinite, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations involving infinity and zero.

DONE.
