  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has the property 'latitude' in its prototype chain, not just in its own properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.bind(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the object and checks if the object has the property 'latitude' in its own properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has the property 'latitude' in its prototype chain, not just in its own properties, using the Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty method.

DONE.
