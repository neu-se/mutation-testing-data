  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parse function to treat strings with fewer than 2 elements differently than they are currently being treated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parse function to treat strings with more than 2 elements differently than they are currently being treated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parse function to treat strings with only 1 element differently than they are currently being treated.

DONE.
