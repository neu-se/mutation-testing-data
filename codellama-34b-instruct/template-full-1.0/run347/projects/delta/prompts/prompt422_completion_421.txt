  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain only the `length` of the current `op`, instead of the `length` of the retained content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain only the `length` of the retained content, instead of the `length` of the current `op`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(offset, index) - Math.min(offset, baseIndex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain only the `length` of the retained content that is within both the current `op` and the `baseOp`.

DONE.
