  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(other.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with the length of the `other` delta, which is not the same as the length of the `delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(this.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with the length of the `this` delta, which is not the same as the length of the `delta` object.

DONE.
