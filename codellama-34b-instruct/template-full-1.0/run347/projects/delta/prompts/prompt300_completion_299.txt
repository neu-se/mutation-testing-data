  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move back one step instead of forward one step, which would result in a different attribute object being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength() + 1).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move ahead by one more step than the original code, which would result in a different attribute object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength() * 2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move ahead twice as many steps as the original code, which would result in a different attribute object being returned.

DONE.
