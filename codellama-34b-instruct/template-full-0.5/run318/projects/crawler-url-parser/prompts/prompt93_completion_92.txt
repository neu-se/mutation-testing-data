  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr).url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property of the object returned by the `parse` function is not defined, which would cause an error.

DONE.
