 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the length property of the current object, rather than the Op.length function. This could lead to incorrect length calculation if the object has a custom length property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the index to an absolute value, which is not the same as calculating the length of an operation. This could lead to incorrect length calculation and unexpected behavior in the slice method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a potential length property of the newOp object, rather than the Op.length function. This could lead to incorrect length calculation if the newOp object has a custom length property.

DONE.
