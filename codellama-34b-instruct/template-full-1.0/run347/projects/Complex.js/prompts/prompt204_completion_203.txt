  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would be applied to the complex number `b`, rather than the real part `a` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* b` operation would be applied to the real part `a`, rather than the complex number `b` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a) * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.exp(a)` operation would be applied to the real part `a`, rather than the entire complex number `b` as intended.

DONE.
