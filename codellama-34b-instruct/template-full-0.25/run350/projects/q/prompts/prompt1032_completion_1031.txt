  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with the `error` object as an argument, while the modified code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with the `error` object as an argument, while the modified code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with `undefined` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with the `error` object as an argument, while the modified code fragment calls the `nodeback` function with `0` as an argument.

DONE.
