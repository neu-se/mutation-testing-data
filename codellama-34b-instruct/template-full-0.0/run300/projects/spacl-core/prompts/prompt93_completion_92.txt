  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy with the same name as the current policy, rather than adding a new policy to the collection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the policy with the same name as the current policy to null, rather than adding a new policy to the collection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, new Policy(policy.name, policy.rules))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new policy with the same name and rules as the current policy, rather than adding a new policy to the collection.

DONE.
