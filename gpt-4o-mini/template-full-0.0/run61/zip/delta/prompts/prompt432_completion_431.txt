Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to return `{ retain: Infinity }` when the index is out of bounds, instead of returning the next operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nextOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `nextOp` is falsy (null or undefined), which would cause the method to return `{ retain: Infinity }` even if there are valid operations available, thus skipping valid operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat operations with an undefined `retain` property as if they were not present, leading to potential errors in processing valid operations that should be retained.

DONE.
