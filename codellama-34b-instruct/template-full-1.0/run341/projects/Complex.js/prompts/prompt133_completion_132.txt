  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a value is Not a Number, while `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isNaN()` in place of `isInfinite()` would cause the `div` method to return `NaN` when dividing by zero, even if the dividend is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` checks if a value is zero, while `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isZero()` in place of `isInfinite()` would cause the `div` method to return `0` when dividing by a non-zero value, even if the dividend is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['INFINITY']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Comple
