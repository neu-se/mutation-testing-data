  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!loop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the value of `loop`, causing the loop to be skipped even if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment operator `=` will set the value of `loop` to `false`, causing the loop to exit even if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is falsy, causing the loop to terminate after the first iteration even if `read` returns a truthy value.

DONE.
