  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
onAbort = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is now an empty object, rather than a function, so the `abortCb` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
onAbort = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would now be defined as an empty function, rather than as a reference to the original function, so the `abortCb` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
onAbort = new Error('aborted');
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is now an error object, rather than a function, so the `abortCb` function would not be called and the `cb` function would not be passed an error object.

DONE.
