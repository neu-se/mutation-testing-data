  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with a string would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with a number would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
