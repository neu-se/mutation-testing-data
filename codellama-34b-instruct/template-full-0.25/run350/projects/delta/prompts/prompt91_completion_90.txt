  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. If `newOp.attributes` is an object, the original code would execute the `if` block, but if it is null, the new code would execute the `else` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if it is undefined. If `newOp.attributes` is an object, the original code would execute the `if` block, but if it is undefined, the new code would execute the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `new
