  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function with the `value` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply passes the `value` argument to the `nodeback` function, but does not call it.

DONE.
