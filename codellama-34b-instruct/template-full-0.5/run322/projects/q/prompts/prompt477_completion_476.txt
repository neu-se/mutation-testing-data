  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return the index of the first occurrence of the `promise` in the `unhandledRejections` array, which would be 0 if the `promise` is the first element in the array. Subtracting 1 from this index would result in -1, which is an invalid index and would not allow the `untrackRejection` function to remove the `promise` from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return the index of the first occurrence of the `promise` in the `unhandledRejections` array, which would be 0 if the `promise` is the first element in the array. Adding 1 to this index would result in 1, which is a valid index but would not allow the `untrackRejection` function to remove
