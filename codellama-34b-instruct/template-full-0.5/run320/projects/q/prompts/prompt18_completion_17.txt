  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0, regardless of the input value, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 1, regardless of the input value, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return -1, regardless of the input value, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
