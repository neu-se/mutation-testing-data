  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  line.push(new OpInsertMessage(iter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `OpInsertMessage` constructor expects a string as its argument, but `iter.next()` will return an object of type `Op`, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  iter.next();iter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over one extra iteration of the loop, potentially missing a chunk of code that needs to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  line.push(iter.next().length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the length of the next chunk of code onto the `line` array, rather than the chunk itself, which would change the behavior of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
