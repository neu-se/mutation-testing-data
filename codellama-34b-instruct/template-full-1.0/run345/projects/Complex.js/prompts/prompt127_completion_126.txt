  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `<PLACEHOLDER>` would not be evaluated, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the checks has been reversed, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `<PLACEHOLDER>` would be evaluated twice, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
