  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `plural` function calls itself recursively without any base case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return word + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the word with the "ies" suffix, regardless of the input word or the number of items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return num > 1 ? word + 's' : word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the word with the "s" suffix if the number of items is greater than 1, but the original code always returns the word with the "s" suffix if the number of items is not 1.

DONE.
