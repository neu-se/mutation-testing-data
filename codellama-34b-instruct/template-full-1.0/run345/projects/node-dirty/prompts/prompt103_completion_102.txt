  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the row with the given key and value, instead of just the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the row with the key that is equal to `null`, instead of the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would recursively delete the row with the given key, instead of just deleting it once.

DONE.
