  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+resolver";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to concatenate the string `"+"` with the `resolver` function, which would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolver"();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `resolver` function as if it were a standalone function, instead of a method of the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolver;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the `resolver` method of the `deferred` object, but not invoke it.

DONE.
