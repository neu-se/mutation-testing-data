Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to extract a substring from the 8th character to the 7th character, resulting in an empty string instead of the expected type string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to extract a substring from the 8th character to the 0th character, which would also result in an empty string, leading to incorrect type identification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to extract a substring from the 8th character to the 2nd character from the end, which would yield a different result than the original implementation, potentially leading to incorrect type identification.

DONE.
