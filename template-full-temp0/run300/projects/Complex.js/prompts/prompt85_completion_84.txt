  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `0`, while the new code fragment sets it to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `0`, while the new code fragment sets it to `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `z['im']` to `0`, while the new code fragment sets it to `Infinity`.

DONE.
