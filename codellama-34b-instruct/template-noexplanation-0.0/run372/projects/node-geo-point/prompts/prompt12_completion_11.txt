  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This code fragment checks if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements. This change will cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object does not have a `type` property with the value `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This code fragment checks if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'` and if the `coordinates` property is not an array with two elements. This change will cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object does not have a `type` property with the value `'Point
