  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so the code would enter the `if` block if `aborted` is `false`, instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && !busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `aborted` and `!busy` are `true`, so the code would enter the `if` block if `aborted` is `true` and `busy` is `false`, instead of `true` and `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `aborted` or `busy` is `true`, so the code would enter the `if` block if `aborted` is `true` or `busy` is `true`, instead of
