  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not defined, and `0` is a different value than `i` would have been.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not defined, and `-1` is a different value than `i` would have been.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not defined, and `1` is a different value than `i` would have been.

DONE.
