  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 field.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the input case-insensitive, allowing duplicate values with different casing to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 field.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the input, effectively changing the value of the field.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.random() > 0.5 ? field : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly return either the input field or null, potentially allowing duplicate values to pass through.

DONE.
