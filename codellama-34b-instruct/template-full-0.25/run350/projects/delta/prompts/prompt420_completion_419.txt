  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest of two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b) => a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because this function simply adds the two numbers together, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest of the two numbers.

DONE.
