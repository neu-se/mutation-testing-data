  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `abs` and `arg` properties are in `b` instead of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in b && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `abs` and `arg` properties are in `b` instead of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either the `abs` or `arg` properties are in `a` or `b`.

DONE.
