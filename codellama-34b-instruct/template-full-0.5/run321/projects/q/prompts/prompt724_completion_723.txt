  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error, which would cause the `all` method to also reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error, which would cause the `all` method to also reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the error, which would cause the `all` method to also resolve.

DONE.
