  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is a different function than `trackRejection`, and it would not track the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `trackRejection` function with the `promise` and `reason` arguments, which would track the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `trackRejection` function with the `promise` and `reason` arguments, which would track the rejection.

DONE.
