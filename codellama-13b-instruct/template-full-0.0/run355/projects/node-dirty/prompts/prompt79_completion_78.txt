  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the original code fragment emits the 'error' event when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'end' event is emitted when the read stream reaches the end of the file, whereas the original code fragment emits the 'error' event when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'readable'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'readable' event is emitted when the read stream is ready to be read from, whereas the original code fragment emits the 'error' event when an error occurs.

DONE.
