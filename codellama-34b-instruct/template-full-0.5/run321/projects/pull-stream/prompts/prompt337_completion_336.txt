  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `field` function on the `data` object, which could potentially return a different value than the `prop` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `prop` function on the `data` object, which could potentially return a different value than the `field` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) + prop(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call both the `field` and `prop` functions on the `data` object and combine their results, which could potentially produce a different output than the original code.

DONE.
