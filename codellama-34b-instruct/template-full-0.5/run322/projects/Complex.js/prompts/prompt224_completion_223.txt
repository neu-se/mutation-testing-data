  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to comparison, while this replacement uses a strict greater than comparison. This means that the original code fragment would include the value 0 in the comparison, while this replacement would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to comparison, while this replacement uses a strict inequality comparison. This means that the original code fragment would include the value 0 in the comparison, while this replacement would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to comparison, while this replacement uses a strict inequality comparison. This means that the original code fragment would include the value 0 in the comparison, while this replacement would not.

DONE.
