Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent !== srcParent && destParent !== path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now the opposite of the original, causing the function to continue checking parent paths even when it should stop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent === path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now only checking if the source parent is the root, ignoring the case where the destination parent is the same as the source parent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent === srcParent || destParent === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now using a hardcoded root path '/' instead of the root path determined by `path.parse(destParent).root`, which could lead to incorrect results on different operating systems.

DONE.
