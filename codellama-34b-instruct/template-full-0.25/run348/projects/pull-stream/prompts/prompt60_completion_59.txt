  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

sink.abort(true)

This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abort` method on the `sink` object with the argument `true`, which would cause the `abort` method to be called with a truthy value, which would then cause the `read` method to be called with the argument `true`, which would then cause the `done` callback to be called with the argument `null`, which would then cause the `console.warn` method to be called with the argument `doneLackingErr`, which would then cause the `throw` statement to be executed with the argument `doneLackingErr`, which would then cause the `drain` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abort` method on the `sink` object with the argument `false`, which would cause the `abort` method to be called with a fals
