  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable reference, while `a + 1` is an arithmetic expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable reference, while `b` is a different variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable reference, while `this.b` is a reference to a property of the current object.

DONE.
