  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, [value, index, self])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the callback function, and the value of the argument is different from the original code.

DONE.
