  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notReject
```
This would result in different behavior because "notReject" is an undefined method, so an error would be thrown instead of the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be created and passed as the rejection reason instead of the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because a string would be passed as the rejection reason instead of the original reason.

DONE.
