  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be parsed as a path, rather than a host, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be parsed as a path, rather than a host, which could lead to incorrect results.
