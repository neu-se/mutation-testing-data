  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator has a lower precedence than the && operator, so the expression would first evaluate `read` and then `typeof read.source === 'function'`. If `read` is truthy, the expression would return true without checking the second part of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator has a higher precedence than the && operator, so the expression would first evaluate `read` and then negate its type. If `read` is not null, the expression would return false without checking the second part of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source && typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the .source property is not present on the `read` function, so the expression would throw a TypeError.
