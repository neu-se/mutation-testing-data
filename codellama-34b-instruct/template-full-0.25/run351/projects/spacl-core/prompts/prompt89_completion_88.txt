  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to use the same key for all policies, which would cause collisions and potentially overwrite existing policies.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toLowerCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to use a lowercase version of the policy name as the key, which would cause collisions with policies that have the same name but different casing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name + Math.random()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to use a random number as the key, which would cause collisions with policies that have the same name but different random numbers.

DONE.
