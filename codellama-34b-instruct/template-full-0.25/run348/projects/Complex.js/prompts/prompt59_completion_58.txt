  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` will always return `false`, even if the input is not a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` will return `true` if the input is `NaN`, but `false` if the input is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` will return `true` if the input is an integer, but `false` if the input is a non-integer finite number.

DONE.
