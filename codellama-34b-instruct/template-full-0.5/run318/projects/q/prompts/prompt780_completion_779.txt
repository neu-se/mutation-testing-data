  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` returns a promise that resolves with the promise's state, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise's result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(promise)` returns a rejected promise with the given promise as the rejection reason, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise's result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(promise)` returns a resolved promise with the given promise as the resolution value, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise's result.

DONE.
