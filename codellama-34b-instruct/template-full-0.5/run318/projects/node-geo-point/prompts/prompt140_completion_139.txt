  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would return a new `GeoPoint` object with the same latitude as the original point, but with a potentially different longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would return a new `GeoPoint` object with a longitude that is one degree different from the original point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method would return a new `GeoPoint` object with a longitude that is 180 degrees different from the original point.

DONE.
