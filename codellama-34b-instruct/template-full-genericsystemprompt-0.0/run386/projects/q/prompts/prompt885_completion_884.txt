  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the function without the first element, which could cause the function to behave differently or even fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an extra argument to the function, which could cause the function to behave differently or even fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the function in reverse order, which could cause the function to behave differently or even fail.

DONE.
