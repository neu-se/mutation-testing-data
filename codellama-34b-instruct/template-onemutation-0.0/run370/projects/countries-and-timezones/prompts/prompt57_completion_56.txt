  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the country with the given ID does not exist in the `countries` object, while the new code fragment checks if the country with the given ID exists in the `countries` object.

DONE.
