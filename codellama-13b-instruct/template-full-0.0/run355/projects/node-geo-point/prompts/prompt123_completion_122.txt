  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` function would return the latitude of the `point` parameter instead of the bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` function would return the longitude of the `point` parameter instead of the bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` function would return the sum of the latitude and longitude of the `point` parameter instead of the bearing between the two points.

DONE.
