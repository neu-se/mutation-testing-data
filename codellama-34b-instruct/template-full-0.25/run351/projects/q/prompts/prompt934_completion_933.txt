  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `void 0` is a more explicit way of writing `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and could potentially cause issues if the function being called expects a specific type of argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, whereas `undefined` is a value of type `undefined`.

DONE.
