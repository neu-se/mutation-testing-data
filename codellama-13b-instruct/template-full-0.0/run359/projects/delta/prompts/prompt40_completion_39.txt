  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the keys in the `a` object, while this code fragment returns the number of keys in the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the keys in the `b` object, while this code fragment returns the number of keys in the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of all the keys in the `a` and `b` objects, while this code fragment returns an array of all the keys in the `a` and `b` objects, concatenated together.

DONE.
