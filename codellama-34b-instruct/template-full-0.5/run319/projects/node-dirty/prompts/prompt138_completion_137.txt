  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called on the `this._data` object with the `key` variable as an argument, which would not be the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called on the `this._data` object with the `key` variable plus one as an argument, which would not be the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called on the `this._data` object with the `key` variable minus one as an argument, which would not be the case in the original code.

DONE.
