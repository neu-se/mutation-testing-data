  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the context of the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have a `then` method, so the promise will not be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new TypeError("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because a `TypeError` exception is thrown, which will not be caught by the `try` block.

DONE.
