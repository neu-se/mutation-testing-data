 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use a string as an index instead of an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the prototype's keys method instead of the static keys method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the array keys method instead of the object keys method.

DONE.
