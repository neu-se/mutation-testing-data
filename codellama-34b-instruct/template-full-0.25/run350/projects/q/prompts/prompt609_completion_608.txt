  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `args`, which would cause the first argument to be removed from the array before it is passed to the `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is called on `args`, which would cause the number `1` to be added to the end of the array before it is passed to the `resolve` method.

DONE.
