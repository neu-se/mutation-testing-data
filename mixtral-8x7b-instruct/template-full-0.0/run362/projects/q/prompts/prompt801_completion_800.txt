 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method treats `null` and `undefined` differently. In the original code, passing `undefined` as an argument to `then` would ignore the onFulfilled/onRejected/onProgress callbacks, while passing `null` would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method treats `0` and `undefined` differently. In the original code, passing `undefined` as an argument to `then` would ignore the onFulfilled/onRejected/onProgress callbacks, while passing `0` would treat it as an onFulfilled callback and immediately resolve the returned promise with the value `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the progressed argument.
