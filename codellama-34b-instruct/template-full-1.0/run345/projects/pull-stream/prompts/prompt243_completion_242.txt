  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `abort` variable, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should have been `false`, leading to the premature exit of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `abort` variable to be coerced into a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior when comparing the resulting value to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would cause the `abort` variable to be called as a function, which could lead to a runtime error if `abort` is not a function or if the function it references is not defined.

DONE.
