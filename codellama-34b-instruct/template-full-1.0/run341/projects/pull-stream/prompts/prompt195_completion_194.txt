  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a value (`aborted`) and not a function (`aborted()`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `aborted` and would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `aborted` and would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
