  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a function that takes a promise and an array of arguments, but it does not incorporate the Node.js-style callback structure that `nfapply` uses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a function that takes a callback and an array of arguments, but it does not return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback and returns a new promise, but it does not execute the callback with the arguments in the same way that `nfapply` does.

DONE.
