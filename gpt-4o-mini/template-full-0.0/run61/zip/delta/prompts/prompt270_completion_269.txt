Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `retDelta` without calling the `chop()` method, potentially leaving the delta unoptimized and including unnecessary operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta.chop(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `chop()` with a boolean argument, which may change the internal logic of the `chop` method (if it accepts a parameter), leading to a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a numeric argument to `chop()`, which may not be the expected type or value, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior in the delta processing.

DONE.
