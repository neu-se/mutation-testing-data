  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passed one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a different function than `stringify`, and it has different behavior when passed the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` takes an optional third argument that specifies the number of spaces to indent the output, and the original code fragment did not specify this argument.

DONE.
