  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in the function call being executed immediately, rather than being delayed until the promise is resolved. This would likely result in unexpected behavior and could potentially lead to errors or exceptions being raised before the user has a chance to handle them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in the function call being delayed by a specified amount of time, rather than being executed immediately. This could be useful for simulating real-world scenarios where the function may need to wait for some external event to occur before it can be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in the function call being rejected with the specified error, rather than being resolved with a value. This could be useful for testing the error handling of the user's code, and for checking that the code behaves correctly when an error is encountered.

DONE.
