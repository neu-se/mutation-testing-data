  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplication by b+1 is different than multiplication by b alone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * math.sqrt(a+b+b**2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a non-square number is imaginary, which would cause the output of the function to differ from the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because switching the third parameter c with a shuffled index would change the result of the function.

DONE.
