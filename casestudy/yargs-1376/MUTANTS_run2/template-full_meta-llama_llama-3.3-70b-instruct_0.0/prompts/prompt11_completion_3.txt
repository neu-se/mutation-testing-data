Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', potentially allowing configurations with 'extends' properties to bypass the extend handling logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'extends' property exists within itself, potentially causing an infinite recursion or unexpected behavior if the 'extends' property is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extends' in config
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'in' operator to check for the presence of the 'extends' property in the config object, which may include inherited properties, whereas the original code checks for the property's presence using Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call, which only considers the object's own properties.

DONE.
