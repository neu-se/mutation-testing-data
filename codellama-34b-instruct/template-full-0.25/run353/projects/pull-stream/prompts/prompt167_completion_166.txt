  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `onAbort` if `abort` is truthy, whereas the original code would call `onAbort` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `onAbort` if `abort` is falsy, whereas the original code would only call `onAbort` if `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `onAbort` if `abort` is falsy, whereas the original code would only call `onAbort` if `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
