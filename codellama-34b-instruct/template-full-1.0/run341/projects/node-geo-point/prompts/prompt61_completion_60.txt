  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the angular distance (δ) would be incorrect, leading to a completely wrong bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the angular distance (δ) would be incorrect, leading to a completely wrong bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the angular distance (δ) would be incorrect, leading to a completely wrong bearing value.

DONE.
