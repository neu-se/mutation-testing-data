  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function than `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may produce a different output when applied to the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `true` is added to the `AttributeMap.invert` function, which would cause the function to behave differently when the input attributes are null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `false` is added to the `AttributeMap.invert` function, which would cause the function to behave differently when the input attributes are null or undefined.

DONE.
