 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(b) - Math.exp(-b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the hyperbolic cosine using an exponential function with a base of `e` instead of using the cosh function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of the hyperbolic cosine instead of directly calculating the hyperbolic sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the double of the hyperbolic sine of `b` instead of the hyperbolic cosine of `b`.

By introducing these changes, the mutated code will produce different results than the original code, helping to identify potential weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
