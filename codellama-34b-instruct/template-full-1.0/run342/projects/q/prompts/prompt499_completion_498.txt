  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any falsy value for `name`, including `undefined`, `null`, `0`, and an empty string, to be considered a valid value for `name`, whereas the original code fragment only allows `null` and `undefined` to be considered valid values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any value that is `undefined` to be considered a valid value for `name`, whereas the original code fragment only allows `undefined` to be considered a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any falsy value for `name`, including `undefined`, `null`, `0`, and an empty string, to be considered a valid value for `name`, whereas the original code fragment only allows `undefined` and `null` to be considered valid values.
