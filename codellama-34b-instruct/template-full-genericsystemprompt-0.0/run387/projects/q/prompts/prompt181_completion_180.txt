  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regular expression matches the string, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns an array of matches, whereas the `exec` method returns an array of matches and the index of the match in the string.

DONE.
