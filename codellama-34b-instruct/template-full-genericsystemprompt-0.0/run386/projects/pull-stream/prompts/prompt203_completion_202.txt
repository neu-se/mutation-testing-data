  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end + 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - 1` expression would always evaluate to a falsy value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
