  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.forEach((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a value, whereas `map` returns a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reduce((acc, policy) => acc.set(policy.name, policy), new Map())
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` would return a new map, while `map` returns an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.some((policy) => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` returns a boolean value, while `map` returns an array.

DONE.
