  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value` if it is not undefined, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value` if it is not undefined, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `value` if it is not undefined, but replacing it with `NaN` would cause the function to return `NaN` regardless of the value of `value`.

DONE.
