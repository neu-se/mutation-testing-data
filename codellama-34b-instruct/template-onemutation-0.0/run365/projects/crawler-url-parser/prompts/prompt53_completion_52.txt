  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `parsedUrl.pathname` as the second argument to `URL.resolve()`, while the modified code fragment uses `parsedUrl.pathname` as the first argument. This would cause the resolved URL to be different, potentially leading to different behavior in the `parse()` function.

DONE.
