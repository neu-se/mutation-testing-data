  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `id`, and it may not be a valid timezone ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(c);
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `id`, and it may not be a valid timezone ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz.r);
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a different variable than `id`, and it may not be a valid timezone ID.

DONE.
