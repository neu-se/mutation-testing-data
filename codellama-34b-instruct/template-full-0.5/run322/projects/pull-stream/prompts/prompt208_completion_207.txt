  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is being passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `null` is a constant value that is not related to the `aborted` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is being passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `undefined` is a constant value that is not related to the `aborted` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"aborted"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is being passed as an argument to the `cb` function, while `"aborted"` is a string constant that is not related to the `aborted` variable.

DONE.
