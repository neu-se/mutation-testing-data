  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin(sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asin` function is being applied to a different argument, which can produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(cos(θ) * cos(δ) * sin(φ1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function is being applied to a different argument, which can produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π - asin(sin(θ) * sin(δ) * cos(φ1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `π` value is being subtracted from the result of `asin`, which can also produce different results.
DONE.
