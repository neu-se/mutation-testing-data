  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while the replacement code fragment `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the `logHypot` function to receive a different input, which could potentially result in a different output.

DONE.
