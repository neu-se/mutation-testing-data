  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is checking the `a` property instead of the `re` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is checking the `b` property instead of the `re` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is checking the sum of the `a` and `b` properties instead of the `re` property.

DONE.
