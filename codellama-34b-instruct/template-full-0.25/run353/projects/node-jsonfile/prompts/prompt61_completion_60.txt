  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `Buffer.isBuffer`, so if the content is a buffer, it would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer` is a function, and calling it without arguments would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer` is a function, and calling it with the `content` argument would return `true` if the content is a buffer, but `false` if it's not.

DONE.
