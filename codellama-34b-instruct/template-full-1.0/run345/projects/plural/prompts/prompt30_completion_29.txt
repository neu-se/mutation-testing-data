  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crises/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only match singular "thesis" or "crisis," but the new code fragment would match both singular and plural forms.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/word$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only match words that end with "thesis" or "crisis," but the new code fragment would match any word that ends with "word."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Alex
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not match the string "Alex," but the new code fragment would match the string "Alex."

DONE.
