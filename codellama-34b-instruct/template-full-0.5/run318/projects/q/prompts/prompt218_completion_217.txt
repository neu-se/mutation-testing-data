  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(null)` would return a fulfilled promise with a value of `null`, whereas `fulfill` without any arguments would return a fulfilled promise with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(undefined)` would return a fulfilled promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `fulfill` without any arguments would return a fulfilled promise with no value.

DONE.
