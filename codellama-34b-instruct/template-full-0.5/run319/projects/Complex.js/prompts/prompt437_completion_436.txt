  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, places || 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `10`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `100`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `10`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `100`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `Math.PI`, causing the `Math.pow` function to always return `314159265359`.

DONE.
