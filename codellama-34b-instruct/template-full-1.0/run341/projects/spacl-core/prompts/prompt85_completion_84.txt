  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method would be called with a `false` argument, which would create a shallow copy of the rule instead of a deep copy. This could affect the behavior of the program if the rule object contains references to other objects or functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(rule.name + ' clone')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method would be called with a different name argument, which could affect the naming of the resulting clone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(rule.x * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method would be called with a different value for the `x` parameter, which could affect the behavior of the cloned rule.

DONE.
