  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character 'a' is different from the original character 'e', which would cause the regex to match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character 'i' is different from the original character 'e', which would cause the regex to match a different set of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'o'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement character 'o' is different from the original character 'e', which would cause the regex to match a different set of words.

DONE.
