  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the element at index 2 is accessed, but in the mutated code, the element at index 3 is accessed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the element at index 2 is accessed, but in the mutated code, the element at index 1 is accessed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the element at index 2 is accessed, but in the mutated code, the element at index 0 is accessed instead.

DONE.
