  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acos` is the arccosine function, which returns a value between 0 and π. The replacement code fragment `1 - r` would return a value between -1 and 0, which would result in a different output for the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acos` is the arccosine function, which returns a value between 0 and π. The replacement code fragment `r * 2` would return a value between 0 and 2π, which would result in a different output for the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acos` is the arccosine function, which returns a value between
