  As a mutation testing expert, I have analyzed the given code and identified three potential mutations.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to count the number of characters in the operation plus one, rather than just the number of characters. This would cause the code to potentially miss or double-count characters, leading to errors in the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to count the number of characters in the operation minus one, rather than just the number of characters. This would cause the code to potentially skip or miss characters, leading to errors in the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to count the number of characters in the operation multiplied by two, rather than
