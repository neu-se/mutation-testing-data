  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to throw an error since `null` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would not do anything since `undefined` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to throw an error since `""` is not an object.

DONE.
