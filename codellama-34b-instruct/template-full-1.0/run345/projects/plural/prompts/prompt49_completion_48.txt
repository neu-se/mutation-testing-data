  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/s/i, function(w)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fail to account for the 's' at the end of words that are already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/s(?=\$)/i, function(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle the case where the 's' is not at the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/s{2,}/i, function(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle the case where there are multiple 's' at the end of the word.

DONE.
