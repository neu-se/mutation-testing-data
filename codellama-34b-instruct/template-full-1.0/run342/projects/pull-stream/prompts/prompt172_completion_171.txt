  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, causing the condition to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `array`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` returns the number of elements in the array, so the condition would always evaluate to `false` if `array` is not an array, and `true` if `array` is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof array` would return `'object'` if `array` is not an array, and `'function'` if `array` is an array.

DONE.
