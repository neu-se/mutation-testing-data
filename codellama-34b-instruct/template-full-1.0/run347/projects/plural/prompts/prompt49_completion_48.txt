  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\w+y$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes words that end in -y but are not preceded by a consonant, such as "city".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'os' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes words that end in -o, such
