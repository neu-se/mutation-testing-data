 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the cosecant of `a` instead of using the sine of `a`. This change would cause the `sin` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of `b` instead of the cosine of `a`. This change would cause the `sin` method to return incorrect results when the input is not purely imaginary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of `2 * b` instead of the sine of `a`. This change would cause the `sin` method to return incorrect results when the input is not purely imaginary.

DONE.
