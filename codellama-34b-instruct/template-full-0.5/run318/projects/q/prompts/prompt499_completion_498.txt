  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null` or `void 0`, and it may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and it may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `null` or `undefined`, and it may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
