  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return this.inspect().state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise in the pending state, which would always return `true` for the `isPending` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise in the fulfilled state, which would always return `true` for the `isPending` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return this.inspect().state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise in the rejected state, which would always return `true` for the `isPending` method.

DONE.
