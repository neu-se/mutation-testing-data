Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns an array of rules that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which may lead to an empty array if no rules are cloned, instead of cloning all rules as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce((acc, rule) => acc.concat(rule), [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is used incorrectly here; it concatenates rules into a single array but does not clone them, resulting in a shallow copy of the rules instead of deep cloning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code simply returns the original rules without cloning them, leading to potential side effects if the original rules are modified later, as they are not independent copies.

DONE.
