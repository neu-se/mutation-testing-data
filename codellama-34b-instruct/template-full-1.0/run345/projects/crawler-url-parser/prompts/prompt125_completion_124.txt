  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(linkurl) == "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code verifies that `linkurl` is a string, but this code fragment verifies that it is an object. This would cause the function to behave differently when `linkurl` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(linkurl) == "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code verifies that `linkurl` is a string, but this code fragment verifies that it is undefined. This would cause the function to behave differently when `linkurl` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(linkurl) == "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code verifies that `linkurl` is a string, but this code fragment verifies that it is a function. This would cause the function to behave differently when `linkurl` is a function.

DONE.
