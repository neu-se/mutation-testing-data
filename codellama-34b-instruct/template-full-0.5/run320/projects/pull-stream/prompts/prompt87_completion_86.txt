  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && !test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `!cb` expression, making it always return `false` when `cb` is truthy, regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || !test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` when `cb` is truthy or `test` is falsy, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ^ !test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the XOR of `cb` and `!test`, which would produce a different result than the original code.

DONE.
