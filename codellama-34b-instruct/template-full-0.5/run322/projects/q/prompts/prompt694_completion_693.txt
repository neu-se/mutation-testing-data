  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q + 1` is not a valid promise object, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, which is `null` in this case. This would cause the code to behave differently, as it would no longer be working with the original promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { throw new Error('test'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a new promise that rejects with the error thrown in the callback function. This would cause the code to behave differently, as it would no longer be working with the original promise object.

DONE.
