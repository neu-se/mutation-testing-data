  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `verb` is in `this.verbs`, regardless of the value of `this.verbs[verb]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `this.verbs[verb]`, regardless of whether `verb` is in `this.verbs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `verb` is not in `this.verbs`, regardless of the value of `this.verbs[verb]`.

DONE.
