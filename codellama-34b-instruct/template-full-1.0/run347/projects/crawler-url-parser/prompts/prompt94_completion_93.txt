  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code parses the `href` attribute of the `a` element, while this code fragment concatenates the `href` attribute with the string `".tmp"`. This change would cause the code to parse a different URL, which could result in different behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('data-href')

This change could cause the code to parse a different URL, which could result in different behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + $(this).attr('data-query')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pars
