  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the result of the formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the square would change the result of the formula.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root would change the result of the formula.

DONE.
