  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!cbs.length && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator. This means that the boolean value of `cbs.length` would be inverted before the conditional check, which would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `cbs.length` property reference. This means that the condition would be evaluated as `cbs.length && (err != null)`, which would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err != null && cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be evaluated as `(err != null) && cbs.length`, which would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.
