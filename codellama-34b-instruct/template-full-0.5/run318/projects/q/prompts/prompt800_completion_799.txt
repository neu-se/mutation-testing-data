  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `then` method to be called on a different object than the original `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this["then"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this["then"]` is equivalent to `this.then`, but it uses bracket notation instead of dot notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a function that needs to be called to execute its logic.

DONE.
