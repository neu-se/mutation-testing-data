  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('ftp') ? ftp : http;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method is case-sensitive, so it would not match the `ftp` protocol if the URL starts with `FTP
