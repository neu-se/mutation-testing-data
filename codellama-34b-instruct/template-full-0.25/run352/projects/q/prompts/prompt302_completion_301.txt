  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `x` and `y` are the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x == y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `x` and `y` are the same value, but it would also return `true` if `x` and `y` are different values that are equivalent, such as `0` and `-0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y && x !== -y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if `x` and `y` are the same value, but it would also return `false` if `x` and `y` are different values that are equivalent, such as `0` and `-0`.

DONE.
