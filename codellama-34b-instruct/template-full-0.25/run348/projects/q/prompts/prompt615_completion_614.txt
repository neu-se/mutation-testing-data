  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a valid object, but `null` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a valid object, but `undefined` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a valid object, but `{}` (an empty object) would not have the same properties and methods as the original object.

DONE.
