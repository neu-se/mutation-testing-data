  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the query string and fragment from the URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path from the parsed URL, which could be different from the current URL, leading to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
