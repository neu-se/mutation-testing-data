  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `result.value`, potentially causing the `when` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `result.value` by 2, potentially causing the `when` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `result.value`, potentially causing the `when` function to behave differently.

DONE.
