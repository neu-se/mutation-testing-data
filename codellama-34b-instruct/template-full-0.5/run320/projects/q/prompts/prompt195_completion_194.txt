  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the attempt3 array, which is the filename, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the attempt3 array, which is undefined, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the attempt3 array, which is 3, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

DONE.
