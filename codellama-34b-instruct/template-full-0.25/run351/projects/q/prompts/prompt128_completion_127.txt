  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any object, regardless of whether the key exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any key, regardless of whether the object has that key or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the object has the key as its own property, and not if it inherits the key from its prototype.

DONE.
