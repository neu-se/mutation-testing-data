  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of strings representing the properties of an object, while `Object.assign` creates a new object by copying the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the own enumerable string-keyed properties of an object, while `Object.assign` creates a new object by copying the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs representing the own enumerable string-keyed properties of an object, while `Object.assign` creates a new object by copying the values of all enumerable own properties from
