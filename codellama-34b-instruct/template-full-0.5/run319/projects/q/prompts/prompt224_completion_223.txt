  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different object, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a different function than `Promise.prototype.promiseDispatch`, and would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a different function, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on a non-object, which could lead to a type error.

DONE.
