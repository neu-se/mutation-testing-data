  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This environment was not anticipated by Q. Please file a bug.");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the environment is not anticipated by Q, while the new code fragment throws an error regardless of the environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment continues to execute the rest of the code in the function, while the new code fragment returns early and skips the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the result of the `runSingle` function, while the new code fragment returns `undefined` regardless of the result of the `runSingle` function.

DONE.
