  Sure, I can do that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to halt execution immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"read"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but replacing it with a string `"read"` would cause the function to be called with the argument `read` instead of the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => read
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but replacing it with a lambda function `() => read` would cause the function to be called with the argument `read` instead of the original function.

DONE.
