  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the double equal sign checks for both value and type equality, whereas the triple equal sign checks for value equality only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(1 === b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the double equal signs check for both value and type equality, whereas the triple equal signs check for value equality only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b % 2 !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of b is odd, not if it is equal to 1.

DONE.
