  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `else if` block, which will define the `Complex` object and assign it to the `module.exports` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `else` block, which will define the `Complex` object and assign it to the `root` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'object' && exports.hasOwnProperty('default')
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block, which will define the `Complex` object and assign it to the `module.exports` property.

DONE.
