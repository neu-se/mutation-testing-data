  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set()` will set the value for the given key in the map, whereas `urlMap.get()` would retrieve the value for the given key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.has()` will check if the given key is in the map, whereas `urlMap.get()` would retrieve the value for the given key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.keys()` will return an iterator for the keys in the map, whereas `urlMap.get()` would retrieve the value for the given key in the map.

DONE.
