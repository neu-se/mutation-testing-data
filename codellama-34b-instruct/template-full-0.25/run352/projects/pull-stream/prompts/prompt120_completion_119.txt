  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, but this replacement checks if `end` is `false`. If `end` is `true`, the original code would return `null`, but this replacement would return `end`, which could be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, but this replacement checks if `end` is not `true`. If `end` is `true`, the original code would return `null`, but this replacement would return `end`, which could be a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, but this replacement checks if `end` is `true` and returns `null`
