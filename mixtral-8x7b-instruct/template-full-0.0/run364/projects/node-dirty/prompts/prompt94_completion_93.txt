 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'(' + rowStr + ')'
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to evaluate the rowStr as a JavaScript expression instead of parsing it as JSON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the row to null, discarding the original content of rowStr.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval(rowStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it executes the rowStr as a JavaScript code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if rowStr is coming from an untrusted source.

DONE.
