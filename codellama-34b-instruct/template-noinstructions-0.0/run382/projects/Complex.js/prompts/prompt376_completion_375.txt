  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * a` would return a value that is twice the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment `2 * a + 1` would return a value that is twice the value of `a` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * a` would return a value that is twice the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment `2 * a - 1` would return a value that is twice the value of `a` minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `2 * a` would return a value that is twice the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment `a * 2` would return a value that is the value
