  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw an error, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the method to return a resolved promise, which would result in the promise being fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err, result) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but a function with two arguments is being passed instead. This would cause the method to return a promise that is resolved with the result
