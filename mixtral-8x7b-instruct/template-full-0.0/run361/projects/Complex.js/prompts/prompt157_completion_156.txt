 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by zero would cause an error, while the original code fragment returns `Complex.NAN` for 0/0 and Infinity/Infinity cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive result for the real part, while the original code fragment calculates the real part based on the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the current complex number instead of the second argument in the division, which would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
