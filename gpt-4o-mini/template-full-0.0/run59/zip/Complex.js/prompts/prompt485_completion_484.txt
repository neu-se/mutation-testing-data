Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `exports` is a function instead of an object, which would likely lead to the module not being exported correctly in environments that support CommonJS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `module` is undefined, which would prevent the module from being exported in environments that do support CommonJS, leading to potential runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `define` is an object instead of a function, which would incorrectly assume that the AMD module system is not available, potentially breaking the module's compatibility with AMD loaders.

DONE.
