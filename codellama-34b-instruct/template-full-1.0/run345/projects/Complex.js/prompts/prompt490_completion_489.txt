  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, '__esModule', true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value is not wrapped in an object, which would cause the `define()` function to interpret it as a string value instead of a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, '__esModule', { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` property is set to `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the `define()` function to not define the `Complex` module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, '__esModule', { 'value': true, 'num': 42 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` property is not present in the original code, which would cause the `define()` function to throw an error.

DONE.
