  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called, and the `newOp` object would not be added to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called, and the `newOp` object would not be added to the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would be called with an empty object, which would not have the same effect as pushing the `newOp` object.

DONE.
