 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the division would be changed, causing the tangent function to return incorrect results when the numerator is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1/a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the division would be changed, causing the tangent function to return incorrect results when the denominator is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the tangent function would be using the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, causing incorrect results.

DONE.
