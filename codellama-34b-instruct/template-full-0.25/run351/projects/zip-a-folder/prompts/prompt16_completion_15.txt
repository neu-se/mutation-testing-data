  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for write permission on the target base path, rather than both read and write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for read permission on the source path, rather than both read and write permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetFilePath, fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for write permission on the target file path, rather than both read and write permissions.

DONE.
