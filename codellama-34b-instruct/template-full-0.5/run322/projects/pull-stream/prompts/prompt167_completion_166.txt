  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at index `i` of the `array` instead of the `abort` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the `abort` object instead of the `abort` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the element at index `i` of the `array` instead of the `abort` object.

DONE.
