  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is finite, while the original code checks if the real part is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to 0, while the original code checks if the real part is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is not finite, while the original code checks if it is finite.

DONE.
