  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` returns a new function with the `this` context set to the provided object, whereas `clone()` returns a new object with the same properties as the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` sets the `this` context of the function to the provided object and then calls it, whereas `clone()` returns a new object with the same properties as the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply()` sets the `this` context of the function to the provided object and then calls it with the provided argument list, whereas `clone()` returns a new object with the same properties as the original object.

DONE.
