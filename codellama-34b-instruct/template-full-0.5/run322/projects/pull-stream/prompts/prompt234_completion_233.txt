  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"data"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the test, regardless of the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always fail the test, regardless of the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the test, regardless of the input data.

DONE.
