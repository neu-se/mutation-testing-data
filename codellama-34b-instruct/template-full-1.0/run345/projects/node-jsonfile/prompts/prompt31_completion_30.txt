  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.call(*JSON.parse(obj), obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would not only transform the input object `obj` into a string, but also call the function `options.call` with the result of `JSON.parse(obj)` and `obj` as arguments, even if `options` is not defined or has no `call` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.call(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would not only transform the input object `obj` into a string, but also call the function `options.call` with `obj` as the first argument, even if `options` is not defined or has no `call` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.apply(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would not only transform the input object `obj` into a
