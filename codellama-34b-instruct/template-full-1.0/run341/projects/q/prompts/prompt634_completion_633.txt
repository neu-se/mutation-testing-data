  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.deferred()` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` rejects the promise, whereas `Q` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.promise` is a property that returns the promise, whereas `Q` is a function.

DONE.
