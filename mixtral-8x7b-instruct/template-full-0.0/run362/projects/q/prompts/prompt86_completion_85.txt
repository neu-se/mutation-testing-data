 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called directly instead of using `apply` which allows passing an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply
