Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]();
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the generator function without passing the `arg`, which would lead to incorrect handling of values and exceptions, potentially causing the generator to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `arg` twice to the generator function, which is not the intended usage and could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors due to unexpected argument handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].call(this, arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` for the generator function call, which may lead to incorrect behavior if the generator relies on its own context for execution.

DONE.
