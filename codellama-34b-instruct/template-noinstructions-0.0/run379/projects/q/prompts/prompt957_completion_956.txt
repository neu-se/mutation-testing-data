  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that returns a promise that resolves after a specified delay, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object that can be used to create a promise, while `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves immediately.

DONE.
