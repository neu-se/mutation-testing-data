  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object, while `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise.then(function() {})` returns a promise object that is resolved with the value returned by the function, while `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object that is resolved with the value returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise.catch(function() {})` returns a promise object that is rejected with the value returned by the function, while `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object that is
