  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "corpus," which is not present in the original fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus|[^aeiou]y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "corpus" and the regular expression `/[^aeiou]y$/i`, which would match words that end with a consonant followed by "y."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus|[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "corpus" and the regular expression `/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i`, which would match words that end with a consonant followed by "y" or "quy."
