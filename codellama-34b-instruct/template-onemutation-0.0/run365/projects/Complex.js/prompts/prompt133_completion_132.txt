  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite. Using `isNaN` would cause the code to return `Complex.NAN` for any non-infinite value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
