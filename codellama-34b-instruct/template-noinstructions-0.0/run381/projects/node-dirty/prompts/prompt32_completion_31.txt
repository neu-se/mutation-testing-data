  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the `null` key from the database, which would not have the same effect as deleting the original key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the `undefined` key from the database, which would not have the same effect as deleting the original key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete the empty string key from the database, which would not have the same effect as deleting the original key.

DONE.
