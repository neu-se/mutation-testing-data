 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'body a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all 'a' elements within the 'body' instead of just 'a' elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'#some-id a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all 'a' elements with a parent element that has an id of 'some-id' instead of just 'a' elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.some-class a'
