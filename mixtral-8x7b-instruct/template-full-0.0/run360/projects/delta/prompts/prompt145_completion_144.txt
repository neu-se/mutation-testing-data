 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, rather than the end using `push`. This could cause issues in the rest of the code that relies on the order of the operations in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops[ops.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the last element of the `ops` array without checking if the index is within the bounds of the array. This could cause an `undefined` error or unexpected behavior if the array is empty or resized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops.pop().retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `retain` property of the last element in the `ops` array before adding the new operation. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the rest of the code that
