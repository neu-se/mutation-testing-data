  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the multiplication to result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the division would cause the multiplication to result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * (places - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction would cause the multiplication to result in a different value.

DONE.
