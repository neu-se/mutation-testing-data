  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that would be called with the exception `e` as an argument, while `Q.onerror` is a property that is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(this, e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror.call(this, e)` would call the `Q.onerror` function with the `this` context set to the current object and the exception `e` as an argument, while `Q.onerror` is a property that is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.apply(this, e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror.apply(this, e)` would call the `Q.onerror` function with the `this` context set to the current object and
