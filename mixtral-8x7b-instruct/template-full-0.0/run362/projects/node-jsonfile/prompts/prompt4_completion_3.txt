 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the encoding, which may cause issues if the input file is not text or uses a different encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default encoding to 'utf8', which may not match the desired encoding for certain files, causing issues when reading or writing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes null as the encoding, which may cause issues if the input file is not text or uses a different encoding.

By introducing these changes, you can expose potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should cover various encoding scenarios and handle cases where the provided encoding is invalid or not specified.

DONE.
