 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` combines its arguments using platform-specific separators, while `path.resolve` resolves a sequence of paths or path segments into an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('path').resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code imports `path` at the beginning of the module, but this change would require `path` to be imported within the function, potentially causing issues if the module is not properly imported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__dirname + '/' + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses string concatenation instead of `path.resolve`, which may not handle relative paths or platform-specific path separators correctly.

DONE.
