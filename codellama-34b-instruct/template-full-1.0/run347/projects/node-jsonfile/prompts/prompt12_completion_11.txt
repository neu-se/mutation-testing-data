  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not provided, the original code would use `null` as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`, while this modified code would use `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? null : options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is not provided, the original code would use `options.reviver` as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`, while this modified code would use `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options.reviver` is not provided, the original code would use `null` as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`, while this modified code would use `options.reviver` if it is available, and `null` otherwise.
