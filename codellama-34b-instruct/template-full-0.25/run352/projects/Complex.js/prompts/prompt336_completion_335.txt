  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to be skipped, while the new code fragment would cause the `if` statement to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed, while the new code fragment would cause the `if` statement to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `if` statement to be executed, while the new code fragment would cause the `if` statement to be skipped if `a` is not truthy.

DONE.
