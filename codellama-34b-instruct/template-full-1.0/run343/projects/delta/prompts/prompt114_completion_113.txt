  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delta"
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta` is a string, not a function, and the `reduce` method would throw an error because it expects a function as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a string, not a function, and the `reduce` method would throw an error because it expects a function as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of the `Delta` object, not a function, and the `reduce` method would throw an error because it expects a function as its first argument.

DONE.
