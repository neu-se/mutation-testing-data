  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment `1 + 1` is always executed, regardless of the value of `cb`, while the original code fragment only executed the `if` statement if `cb` was defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment `null` is always executed, regardless of the value of `cb`, while the original code fragment only executed the `if` statement if `cb` was defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment `true` is always executed, regardless of the value of `cb`, while the original code fragment only executed the `if` statement if `cb` was defined.

DONE.
