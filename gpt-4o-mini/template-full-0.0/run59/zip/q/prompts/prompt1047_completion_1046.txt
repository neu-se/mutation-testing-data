Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the `error` object would mean that the caller of the `get` method would not receive any error information, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections or misleading behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"An error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string message instead of the `error` object would change the type of the value being resolved, which could lead to confusion and incorrect handling of the error in the calling code, as it would not be an instance of `Error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of the `error` object would mean that the promise would resolve without any error information, which could cause the calling code to assume that the operation was successful, leading to potential logical errors in the application.

DONE.
