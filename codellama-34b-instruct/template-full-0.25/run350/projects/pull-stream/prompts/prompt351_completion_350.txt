  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment calls the `test` function with the `data` argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with the wrong number of arguments. The original code fragment calls the `test` function with one argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data, data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with the wrong number of arguments. The original code fragment calls the `test` function with one argument, but this replacement code fragment calls it with three arguments.

DONE.
