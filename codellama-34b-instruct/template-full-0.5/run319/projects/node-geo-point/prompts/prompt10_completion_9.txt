  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method is used to invoke the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object, which would return `true` if the `coordinates` property is present on the `point` object, regardless of whether it is inherited or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
