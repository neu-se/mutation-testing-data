  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to always return the same value, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to always return a value that is 1 degree greater than the actual bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This change will cause the bearing calculation to always return a value that is twice the actual bearing.

DONE.
