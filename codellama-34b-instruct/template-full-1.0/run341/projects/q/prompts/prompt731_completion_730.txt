  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress + 10 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `progress` variable is incremented by 10, which would cause the notifier function to be called with a different value than what was originally intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `progress` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the notifier function to be called with a different value than what was originally intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress - 10 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `progress` variable is decremented by 10, which would cause the notifier function to be called with a different value than what was originally intended.

DONE.
