  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["trowsers"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `trowsers` is not a valid plural form, and the pluralization function would not be able to identify it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["trousers", "pantis"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `pantis` is not a valid plural form, and the pluralization function would not be able to identify it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["trousers", "panties"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `panties` is a valid plural form, but the pluralization function would not be able to identify it correctly.

DONE.
