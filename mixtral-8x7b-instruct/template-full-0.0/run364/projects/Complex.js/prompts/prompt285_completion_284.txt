 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` calculates the cosine of a given angle in radians, while `cosh` calculates the hyperbolic cosine of a given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the hyperbolic cosine with the real part of the complex number, which would not provide the correct result for the cosine of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(b) * Math.exp(-b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `Math.exp(b) * Math.exp(-b)` instead of `cosh(b)`, which would not provide the correct result for the cosine of a complex number.

DONE.
