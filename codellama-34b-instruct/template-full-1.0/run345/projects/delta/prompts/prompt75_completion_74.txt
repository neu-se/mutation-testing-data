  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clone
```
This would result in different behavior because `clone` creates a shallow copy of the object, and might not capture the nested structure of the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have any properties or methods that can be accessed or called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have any properties or methods that can be accessed or called.

DONE.
