  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` would create a new deferred object with a null value, which would cause the `delay` method to return a promise that resolves to `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(undefined)` would create a new deferred object with an undefined value, which would cause the `delay` method to return a promise that resolves to `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(new Error())` would create a new deferred object with an error value, which would cause the `delay` method to return a promise that rejects with the error instead of resolving to the original value.

DONE.
