  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current peeked operation, while `otherIter.peekLength() + 1` returns the length of the current peeked operation plus one. This would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to skip over the last operation in the `other` Delta, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current peeked operation, while `otherIter.peekLength() - 1` returns the length of the current peeked operation minus one. This would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to skip over the first operation in the `other` Delta, potentially resulting in a different output.
