  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` would pass the argument `1` to the `flush` function, which is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(undefined)` would pass the argument `undefined` to the `flush` function, which is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
