  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to throw an error, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to return early, without executing the rest of the code in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to return `undefined`, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

DONE.
