 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the undefined value, while the original code checks for the existence of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.hasOwnProperty('url')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'url' property is not in the enumerable properties of the options object, rather than checking the value of the 'url' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.url === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the 'url' property, while the original code checks for the existence of the property.

DONE.
