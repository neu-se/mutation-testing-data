 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext() || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `while` loop to continue indefinitely if `otherIter` has no more elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType || function() { return 'insert' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'insert' as the type, causing the code to treat all operations as inserts, even if they are deletes or retains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext.bind(otherIter)()
