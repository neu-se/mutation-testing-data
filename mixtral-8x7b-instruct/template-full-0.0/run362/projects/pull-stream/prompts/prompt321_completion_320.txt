 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to the callback function, which could cause issues if the order is important in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the data before passing it to the callback, which could cause tests to fail if they are expecting the original data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return data }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the data in an anonymous function, which could cause tests to fail if they are expecting the data to be passed directly.

DONE.
