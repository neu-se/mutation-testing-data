  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error if it tries to access the `domain` property of the third argument, which is now `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, null, domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error if it tries to access the `domain` property of the second argument, which is now `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error if it tries to access the `domain` property of the third argument, which is
