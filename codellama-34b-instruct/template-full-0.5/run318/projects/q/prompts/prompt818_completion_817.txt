  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and `fulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled, and `rejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, and `progress` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress.

DONE.
