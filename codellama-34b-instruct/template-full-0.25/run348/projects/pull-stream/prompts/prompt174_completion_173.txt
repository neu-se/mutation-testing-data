  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array.length` property to determine the length of the array, while this replacement uses `array.length - 1`, which would result in the array being one element shorter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable to determine the length of the array, while this replacement uses `array[0]`, which would result in the array being treated as a single element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable to determine the length of the array, while this replacement uses `array.slice(1)`, which would result in the array being treated as a slice of the original array, starting from the second element.

DONE.
