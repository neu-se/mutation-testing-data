  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one, which would cause the `spread` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one, which would cause the `spread` function to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.
