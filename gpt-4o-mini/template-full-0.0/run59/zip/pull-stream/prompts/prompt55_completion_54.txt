Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `read` variable to `null`, which would cause any subsequent operations that rely on `read` to fail or behave unexpectedly, instead of returning the original `read` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the `read` variable to the `sink` method of `s`, rather than the intended value, which could lead to incorrect data being processed or an error if `read` is not suitable for `s.sink`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` to the `sink` method instead of the `read` value, which may cause the `sink` method to behave incorrectly or throw an error, depending on its implementation.

DONE.
