  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `false`. If `abort` is `false`, the original code would return `null`, but this replacement would return `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `undefined`. If `abort` is `undefined`, the original code would return `null`, but this replacement would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : 'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's a string. If `abort` is a string,
