  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would be called with a non-numeric second argument, which would return a slice containing all elements from the starting index to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, base.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would be called with a second argument that is equal to the length of the `base` array, which would return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, Math.ceil(base.length / 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would be called with a second argument that is half the length of the `base` array, which would return an array containing half of the elements from the starting index to the end of the array.

DONE.
