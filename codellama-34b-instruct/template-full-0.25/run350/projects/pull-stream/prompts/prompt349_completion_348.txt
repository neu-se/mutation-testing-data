  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `toLowerCase()` method on the `data` variable, which could potentially change the behavior of the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data.split(' '))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `split()` method on the `data` variable, which could potentially change the behavior of the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data.replace(' ', ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `replace()` method on the `data` variable, which could potentially change the behavior of the test.

DONE.
