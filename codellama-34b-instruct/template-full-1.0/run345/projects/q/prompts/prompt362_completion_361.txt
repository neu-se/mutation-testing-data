  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function is called with the fulfilled value, whereas the original code calls the `_fulfilled` function with the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function is called with the fulfilled value, whereas the original code calls the `_fulfilled` function with the fulfilled value. Additionally, the `_progressed` function may return a rejected promise, which would cause the promise returned by `then` to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is called with a rejected promise, whereas the original code calls the `_fulfilled` function with the fulfilled value.

DONE.
