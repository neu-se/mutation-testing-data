  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `deg2rad` function on the `longitude` property of `point2` instead of `point1`. This could potentially cause a bug if the `longitude` values of the two points are not equal, as it would result in a different angle being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.latitude) - deg2rad(point1.latitude)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `deg2rad` function on the `latitude` property of `point2` instead of `point1`. This could potentially cause a bug if the `latitude` values of the two points are not equal, as it would result in a different angle being calculated.
