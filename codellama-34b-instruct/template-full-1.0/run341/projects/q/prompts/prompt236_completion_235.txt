  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(), args
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` is a method that returns a new promise object with the given value, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a `Promise` object that may have already been resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj` is a danger keyword and using it as a variable name will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(), args
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` is a method that returns a new promise object that is rejected with the given value, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a `Promise` object that may have already been resolved or rejected.

DONE.
