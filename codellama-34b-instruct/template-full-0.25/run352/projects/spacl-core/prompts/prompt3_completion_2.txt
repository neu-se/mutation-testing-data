  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression global and causes it to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which makes the regular expression multi-line, so it would match the start and end of each line in the string
