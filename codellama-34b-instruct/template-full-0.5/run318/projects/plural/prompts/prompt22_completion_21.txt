  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regex match all occurrences in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regex case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` and `i` flags are removed, which makes the regex match only the first occurrence in the input string and case-sensitive.

DONE.
