  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the `test` function, even if the `test` function is not a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` argument to the `test` function, which may not be a valid use of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) ? data : -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `data` argument to the `test` function, and if the result is negative, it would return the `-1` value.

DONE.
