  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = "Hello World!";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a string argument and returns the result of calling the `toString()` method on the argument. The new code fragment is a string literal that always evaluates to the string "Hello World!".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = 1 / 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a string argument and returns the result of calling the `toString()` method on the argument. The new code fragment is a division operation that will always result in an error, because it is dividing by zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a string argument and returns the result of calling the `toString()` method on the argument
