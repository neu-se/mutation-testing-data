  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because `min` is a variable in the `getNumStr` function, and replacing it with the `min` function from the `Math` object would result in a different function call with potentially different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
getNumStr(-min)
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the `min` value would result in a different calculation and potentially different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
getNumStr(min * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because doubling the `min` value would result in a different calculation and potentially different output.

DONE.
