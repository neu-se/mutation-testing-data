  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() == 'insert' && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `priority` is `true`, regardless of the type of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(other.ops) == 'insert' && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `priority` is `true`, regardless of the type of the peeked operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(other.ops) == 'insert' || priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `priority` is `true`, regardless of the type of the peeked operation.

DONE.
