Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error('Stream aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `onEnd` function when the stream ends, it logs an error message to the console, which may lead to the stream not being properly terminated and could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd && onEnd(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to only call `onEnd` if it is truthy, which could lead to `onEnd` not being called at all if it is `null` or `undefined`, potentially leaving the stream in an incomplete state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the call to `onEnd` with just passing the `abort` value, which does not invoke any function and could lead to the stream not handling the end condition properly, resulting in data loss or unhandled states.

DONE.
