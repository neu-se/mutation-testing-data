  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `getTimezone` function calls itself recursively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error, as the `timezones` object is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[name].name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error, as the `timezones` object is not defined.

DONE.
