  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `object` is an object and has the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, while this modified code checks if `object` has the properties `latitude` and `longitude` but does not check if `object` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== undefined && object.longitude !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `object` has the properties `latitude` and `longitude`, while this modified code checks if `object.latitude` and `object.longitude` are not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['latitude'] !== undefined && object['longitude'] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `object` has the properties `
