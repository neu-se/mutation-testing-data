  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `null` is not an error object and would not cause the stream to error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `undefined` is not an error object and would not cause the stream to error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `new Error()` is a different error object and would cause the stream to error with a different message.

DONE.
