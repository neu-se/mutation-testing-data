  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be created with a different port number, which could cause the message to be sent to a different recipient.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the message would be sent with a different type of data, which could cause the recipient to interpret the message differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the message would be sent with a null value, which could cause the recipient to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
