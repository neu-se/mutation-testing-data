  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not null, and its `stack` property is undefined, which would cause `untrackRejection` to be called with a null value, which would differ from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not an instance of `Error`, and its `stack` property is undefined, which would cause `untrackRejection` to be called with a different type of object, which would differ from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not `undefined`, and its `stack` property is undefined, which would cause `untrackRejection` to be called with a different type of value, which would differ from the original behavior.

DONE.
