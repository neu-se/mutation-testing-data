  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This code fragment uses the `call()` method to call the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object, which is more explicit and less prone to errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This code fragment uses the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method to call the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object, which is more explicit and less prone to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This code fragment uses the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object directly, which is more concise and less prone to errors.

DONE.
