  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `predicate` function, which means that the `predicate` function is called with the opposite of the original value. In contrast, the new code fragment would call the `predicate` function with the original value, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `length` property of the `op` object to determine the length of the operation, while the new code fragment uses the `length` method of the `op` object to determine the length of the operation. The `length` method may return a different value than the `length` property, depending on the implementation of the `op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.retain
```
