  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(array_indexOf(this, value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would be called for every iteration of the loop, instead of just once as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the array elements using the numeric indices instead of the actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(value*value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square each value before pushing it onto the keys array.

DONE.
