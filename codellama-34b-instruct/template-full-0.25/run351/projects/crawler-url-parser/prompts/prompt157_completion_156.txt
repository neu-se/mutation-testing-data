  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last segment of the URL path, which could change the type of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last segment of the URL path, which could change the type of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]+$/, "/")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last segment of the URL path with a slash, which could change the type of the link.

DONE.
