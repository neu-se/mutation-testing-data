  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` 
stackLine.split(":")[1];
```

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the text before the first colon in the stack trace to be different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(1);
```

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the text before the first character in the stack trace to be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:'
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the text after the first colon in the stack trace to be different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
