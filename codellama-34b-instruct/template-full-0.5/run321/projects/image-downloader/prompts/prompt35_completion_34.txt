  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is not being used correctly. The `pipe` method is used to pipe the data from one stream to another, but in this case, it is being used to pipe the data from the `res` object to the `createWriteStream` function, which is not a valid use of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(dest);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is not being used correctly. The `pipe` method is used to pipe the data from one stream to another, but in this case, it is being used to pipe the data from the `res` object to the `dest` variable, which is not a valid use of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest).on('error', reject));
```
This would result in different behavior
