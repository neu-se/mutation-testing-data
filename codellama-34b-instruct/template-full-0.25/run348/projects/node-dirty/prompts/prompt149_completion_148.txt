  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the callbacks would be called in the opposite order than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the array, so the callbacks would be called on a different array than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method filters out any callbacks that are `undefined`, so the callbacks that are called would be a subset of the original callbacks.

DONE.
