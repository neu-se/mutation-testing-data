 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is an empty string instead of checking if it's a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof src !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the source instead of checking if it's a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the source is an array instead of checking if it's a glob pattern.

DONE.
