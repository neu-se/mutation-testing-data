  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 1 from the `opLength` variable, which is not reflected in this replacement code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the `opLength` variable, which is not reflected in this replacement code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is multiplying the `opLength` variable by 2, which is not reflected in this replacement code fragment.

DONE.
