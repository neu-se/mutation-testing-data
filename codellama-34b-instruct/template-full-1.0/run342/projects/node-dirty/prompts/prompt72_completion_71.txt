  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a non-zero number of loaded keys, even if the database file is empty or does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a negative number of loaded keys, which would be unexpected and could cause errors in the code that handles the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'load', NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a non-numeric value for the number of loaded keys, which would cause errors in the code that handles the `load` event.

DONE.
