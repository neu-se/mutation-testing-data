  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by 2 elements instead of 1, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator backward instead of forward, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the loop to get stuck in an infinite loop.

DONE.
