  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning `null`, it would return `undefined`, which might cause issues for the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning `null`, it would return an empty string, which might cause issues for the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
({})
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning `null`, it would return an empty object, which might cause issues for the callback function.

DONE.
