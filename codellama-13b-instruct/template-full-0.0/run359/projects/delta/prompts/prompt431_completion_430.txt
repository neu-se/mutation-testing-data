  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be set to 0, which would cause the `next()` method to return an empty `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be set to `Infinity`, which would cause the `next()` method to return the entire `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `next()` method to return an empty `Op` object.

DONE.
