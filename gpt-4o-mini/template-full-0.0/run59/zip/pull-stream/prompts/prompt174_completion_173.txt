Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `Array.isArray(null)` will return `false`, causing the code to attempt to convert `null` into an array of keys, which will lead to an error when trying to call `Object.keys(null)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(undefined)` will also return `false`, leading to the same issue as above, where `Object.keys(undefined)` will throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray({})` will return `false`, and the subsequent call to `Object.keys({})` will return an empty array, which means the function will behave differently when processing an empty object compared to an actual array.

DONE.
