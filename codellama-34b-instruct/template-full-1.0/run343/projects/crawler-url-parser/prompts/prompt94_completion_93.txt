  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value is falsy, which means that the currentUrl.url would be null, and the map.set() method would not be called, which would result in a different resulting map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not the same as null, and the map.set() method would still be called with the undefined value, which would result in a different resulting map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the baseUrlStr value is not the same as the currentUrl.url value, which means that the map.set() method would be called with a different key, which would result in a different resulting map.

DONE.
