  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the original code fragment emits the `write_close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_error` event is emitted when there is an error writing to the stream, whereas the original code fragment emits the `write_close` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, whereas the original code fragment emits the `write_close` event.

DONE.
