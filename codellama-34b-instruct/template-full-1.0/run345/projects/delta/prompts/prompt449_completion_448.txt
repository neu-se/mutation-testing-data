  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is expected to be a number, but the new code would return true if it is not a number, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is expected to be a number, but the new code would return true if it is undefined, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is expected to be a number, but the new code would return true if it is NaN (Not a Number), which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to true when it should be false.

DONE.
