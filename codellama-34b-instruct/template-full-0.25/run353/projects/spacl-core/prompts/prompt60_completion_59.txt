  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is not called, so the regular expression generated by the `compile` function would not be properly finalized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is called with the wrong argument, so the regular expression generated by the `compile` function would not be properly generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function is called with the wrong arguments, so the regular expression generated by the `compile` function would not be properly generated.

DONE.
