  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'foo'
```
This code fragment will append the string "foo" to the value of the `dest` variable, which is the name of the file to be written. This change will cause the code to write the downloaded data to a file with a different name than the one specified in the `dest` variable, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This code fragment will hardcode the string "foo" as the name of the file to be written, regardless of the value of the `dest` variable. This change will cause the code to always write the downloaded data to a file named "foo", which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This code fragment will cause the `createWriteStream` function to be called with a null value as the first argument, which will result in an error. This change will cause the code to fail to write the downloaded data to a
