Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() || delta.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if there are remaining operations in `otherIter` or if `delta.ops` is empty, which would allow the function to return early even when there are still operations to process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext() &&
            !isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, meaning that the condition would now trigger if the last operation in `delta.ops` is not equal to `newOp`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() &&
            isEqual(delta.ops[0], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are still operations in `otherIter` and if the first operation in `delta.ops` is equal to `newOp`, which could lead to premature termination of the operation processing when it should continue
