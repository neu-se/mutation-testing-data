  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of `/` with `\\`, which would change the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of `/` with an empty string, which would remove the last path segment from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of `/` with `/`, which would not change the URL.

DONE.
