  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would start at the wrong index, resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would end at the wrong index, resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would start and end at the wrong indices, resulting in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
