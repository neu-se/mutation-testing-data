  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `ReturnValue === "undefined"` would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to always return `false`, regardless of the value of `typeof ReturnValue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" || ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `ReturnValue === "undefined"` would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `if` statement to always return `true`, regardless of the value of `typeof ReturnValue`.
