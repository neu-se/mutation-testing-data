  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs of an object's own properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether an object has a property of the given name, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own property names.

DONE.
