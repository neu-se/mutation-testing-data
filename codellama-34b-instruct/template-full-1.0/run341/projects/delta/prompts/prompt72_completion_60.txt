  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(newOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method is used to get the length of the `insert` operation, which is a string, but `attributes` is an object and does not have a length. Using `Op.length` on `attributes` would return `undefined`, which would cause the `retain` operation to be invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.insert).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in an object, but `newOp.insert` is a string and does not have keys. Using `Object.keys` on `newOp.insert` would return an empty array, which would cause the `retain` operation to be invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is
