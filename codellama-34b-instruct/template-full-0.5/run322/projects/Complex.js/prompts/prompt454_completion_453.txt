  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if a number is finite, whereas `isNaN()` checks if a number is NaN (Not a Number).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` checks if a number is zero, whereas `isNaN()` checks if a number is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!this['isNaN']()` would return `true` if `this['isNaN']()` returns `false`, and vice versa.

DONE.
