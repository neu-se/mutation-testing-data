  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `ses.ok`, potentially causing the mutation testing to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because it would test for a different condition, potentially causing the mutation testing to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS = !ses.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the boolean negation of `ses.ok` to the variable `isNodeJS`, potentially causing the mutation testing to produce different results.

DONE.
