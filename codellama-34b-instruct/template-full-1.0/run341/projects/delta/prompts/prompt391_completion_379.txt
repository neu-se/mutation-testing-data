  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek` returns the next operation in the iteration, while `thisIter.next` advances the iteration to the next operation and returns the new current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` returns the next operation in the iteration, while `otherIter.next` advances the iteration to the next operation and returns the new current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` advances the iteration to the next operation and returns the new current operation, while `thisIter.peek` returns the next operation in the iteration without advancing the iteration.

DONE.
