  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the promise was rejected with a specific error message. Replacing it with `null` would cause the error message to be different, and the test would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the promise was rejected with a specific error message. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the error message to be different, and the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the promise was rejected with a specific error message. Replacing it with a different error message would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
