  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (obj) {
    return obj.dispatch;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of the promise, rather than directly accessing the `dispatch` method on the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch(function (err) {
    return err.message;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the promise, rather than directly accessing the `dispatch` method on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally(function () {
    return object.dispatch;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the promise, and it will always return the `dispatch` method on the object, regardless of whether the
