  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement string is different. The original code fragment would match words that end in "y" or "quy" and replace them with "ies", while the new code fragment would match words that end in "y" or "quy" and replace them with "e".
