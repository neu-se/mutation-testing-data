  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the inverse cosine function has a different range and values compared to the arctangent function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the inverse sine function has a different range and values compared to the arctangent function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2
```
This would result in different behavior because the atan2 function is a two-argument function that takes two values: the tangent of the first argument and the tangent of the second argument.

DONE.
