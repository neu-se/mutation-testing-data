  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays. In this case, the `concat()` method is used to concatenate the `this.ops` array with the `other.ops` array, which would not be possible with `slice()`.
