  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code block checks if the arguments length is equal to 1, while this alternative uses the assignment operator to set the arguments length to 0. This means that the conditional statement will always be evaluated as true with this alternative, even if the arguments length is not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code block checks if the arguments length is equal to 1, while this alternative checks if the arguments length is not equal to 1. This means that if the arguments length is actually equal to 1, the conditional statement will evaluate as false with this alternative, even if it would evaluate as true with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code block checks if the arguments length is equal to 1, while
