  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, instead of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument would be passed to the `makeNodeResolver` function, instead of the first argument.

DONE.
