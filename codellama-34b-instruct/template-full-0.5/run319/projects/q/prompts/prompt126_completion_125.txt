  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would always return `false`, causing the `object_keys` function to return an empty array even if the object has properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would always return `false`, causing the `object_keys` function to return an empty array even if the object has properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would always return `false`, causing the `object_keys` function to return an empty array even if the object has properties.

DONE.
