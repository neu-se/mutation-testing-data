 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `minus` variable, causing the code to behave differently when the input string starts with a '-' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the code inside the conditional block, regardless of the values of `plus` and `minus`, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(plus + minus) > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require both `plus` and `minus` to be at least 1, whereas the original code only required one of them to be non-zero. This could cause the code to skip the conditional block in some cases where it should be executed.

DONE.
