  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `forEach` calls a provided function once for each element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `forEach` calls a provided function once for each element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value, while `forEach` calls a provided function once for each element in the array.

DONE.
