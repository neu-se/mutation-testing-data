  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one, which would cause it to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive `undefined` instead of a promise, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a fulfilled promise with the array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive `null` instead of a promise, which would cause it to return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` instead of a fulfilled promise with the array of values.

DONE.
