Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, which would return `false` for `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`, whereas `isNaN` specifically checks if a value is `NaN`, allowing for different handling of those cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, which does not account for the imaginary part or any other conditions that might lead to a `NaN` result, thus potentially missing cases where the complex number is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(c) && c !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `c` is not `NaN` and also ensures that `c` is not an empty string, which could lead to valid numbers being incorrectly processed as invalid if they are empty, whereas `isNaN` would only check for `NaN
