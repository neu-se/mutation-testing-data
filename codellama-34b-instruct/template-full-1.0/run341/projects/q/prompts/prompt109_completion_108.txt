  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < this.length 
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would start at 0 and add 1 to it. The result would still be the same if the index starts at 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would start at 0 and add the length of the array to it. The result would be negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length - i
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would start at the last index of the array if it is changed.

DONE.
