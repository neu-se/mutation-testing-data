  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because "args" is an array, and checking the first element of the array for null will not have the same effect as checking the entire array for null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === []
```
This would result in different behavior because "args" is an array, and checking whether the array is empty or not will not have the same effect as checking whether the array is null or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref === null
```
This would result in different behavior because "ref" is defined as a new array, and checking whether the array is null or not will not have the same effect as checking whether the original "args" array is null or not.

DONE.
