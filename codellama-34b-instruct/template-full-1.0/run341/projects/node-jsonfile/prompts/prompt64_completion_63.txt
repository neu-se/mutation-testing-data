  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string encoding would be different, and the converted content would not be the same as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string encoding would be different, and the converted content would not be the same as the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'binary'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string encoding would be different, and the converted content would not be the same as the original.

DONE.
