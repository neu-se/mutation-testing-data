  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size);
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
The original code fragment calls the `cork` method on the `this._writeStream` object without any arguments. The new code fragment passes the `this._queue.size` property as an argument to the `cork` method. This change could potentially cause the `cork` method to behave differently, depending on the implementation of the `cork` method and the value of the `this._queue.size` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._inFlightWrites);
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
The original code fragment calls the `cork` method on the `this._writeStream` object without any arguments. The new code fragment passes
