Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `name` is an empty string, ignoring the cases where `name` is `null` or `undefined`, which would lead to incorrect handling of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== null && name !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the opposite condition, allowing the code to execute when `name` is defined, which could lead to unintended behavior when `name` is actually `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `name` is strictly `false`, which is unrelated to the original check for `null` or `undefined`, potentially causing the promise to behave incorrectly when `name` is not a boolean.

DONE.
