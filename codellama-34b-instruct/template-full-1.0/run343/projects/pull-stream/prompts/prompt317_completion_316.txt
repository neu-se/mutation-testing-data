  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function, while the new code fragment calls `cb` with an argument `undefined`, which is a no-op and does not affect the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function, while the new code fragment calls `cb` with an argument `'error'`, which is a string and can potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function with a single argument, while the new code fragment calls `cb` with two arguments, `null` and `data`, which can potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
