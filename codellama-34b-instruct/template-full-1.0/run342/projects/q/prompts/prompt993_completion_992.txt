  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a Promise method that rejects the promise with the given argument, whereas `defer` is a method that creates a new Promise with the given function as its resolver.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` resolves the promise with the value `undefined`, whereas `defer` provides a new, unresolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(false)` rejects the promise with the value `false`, whereas `defer` provides a new, unresolved promise.

DONE.
