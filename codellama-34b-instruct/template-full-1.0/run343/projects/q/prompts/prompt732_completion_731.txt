  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises);` line to be executed only if there are still pending promises, instead of when all promises have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises);` line to be executed when the number of pending promises is negative, which is not a valid or meaningful condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises);` line to be executed one more time than the original code, which is not correct.

DONE.
