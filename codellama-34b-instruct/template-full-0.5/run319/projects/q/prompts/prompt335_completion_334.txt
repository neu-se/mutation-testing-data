  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `state` property of the `inspect` object, which may not be the same as the `inspect` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function and return its return value, which may not be the same as the `inspect` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the `inspect` object, which may not be the same as the `inspect` function itself.

DONE.
