  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the peekLength method would not be called with the correct argument, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the peekLength method would not be called with the correct argument, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the next method would not be called with the correct argument, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
