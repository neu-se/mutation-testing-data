Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'retain' when `op` is falsy (e.g., `null` or `undefined`), which could lead to incorrect type identification when an operation is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'retain' only when `op` is explicitly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined`, which could lead to incorrect type identification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 'insert' if `op.retain` is not defined, potentially misclassifying operations that should be identified as 'retain' based on their actual properties.

DONE.
