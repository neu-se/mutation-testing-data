  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `undefined` is not. If the code relies on the value being `null`, it may produce unexpected results when it is actually `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `''` (empty string) is not. If the code relies on the value being `null`, it may produce unexpected results when it is actually an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, but `NaN` (Not a Number) is not. If the code relies on the value being `null`, it may produce unexpected results when it is actually `NaN`.

DONE.
