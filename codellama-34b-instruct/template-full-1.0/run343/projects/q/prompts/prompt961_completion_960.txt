  
Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because a value of `1` would be unshifted onto the `args` array, whereas the original code would leave the `args` array unchanged.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because a length of the `args` array would be unshifted onto the `args` array, whereas the original code would leave the `args` array unchanged.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be unshifted onto the `args` array, whereas the original code would leave the `args` array unchanged.

DONE.
