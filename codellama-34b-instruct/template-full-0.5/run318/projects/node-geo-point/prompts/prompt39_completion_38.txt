  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function, which takes the `y` and `x` coordinates as arguments, while this replacement uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but does not take the `x` and `y` coordinates into account.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = Math.abs(deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use the `Math.abs` function, which would result in the `a` variable being negative if the `point1.longitude` value is greater than the `point2.longitude` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = Math.max(deg
