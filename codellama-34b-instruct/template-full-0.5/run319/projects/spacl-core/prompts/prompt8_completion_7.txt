  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the beginning of the string, but not the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any occurrence of two consecutive slashes, but not the beginning or end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a slash, but not the beginning or end of the string.

DONE.
