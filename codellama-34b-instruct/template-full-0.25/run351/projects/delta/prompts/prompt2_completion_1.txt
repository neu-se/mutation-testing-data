  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is null. If `b` is null, the original code would return an empty object, while this new code would return `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is an instance of the `Array` class. If `b` is an array, the original code would return an empty object, while this new code would return `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor.name === 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is an object by checking its constructor name. If
