  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` argument is expected to be a positive integer, but `0` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` argument is expected to be a positive integer, but `-1` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timeout"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` argument is expected to be a positive integer, but `"timeout"` is a string.

DONE.
