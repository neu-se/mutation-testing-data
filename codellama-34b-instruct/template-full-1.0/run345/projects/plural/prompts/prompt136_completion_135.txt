  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'aye'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "ayes" for words ending in "y", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w[w.length - 1] === 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "es" for words ending in "s", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w[w.length - 2] === 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return "ces" for words ending in "sc", which is not the intended behavior.
DONE.
