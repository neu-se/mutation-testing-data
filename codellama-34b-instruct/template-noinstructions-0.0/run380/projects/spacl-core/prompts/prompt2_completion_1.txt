  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string, not just the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string, not just the first character, and the `[0]` index is accessing the first match, not the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the entire string, not just the first character, and the `.length` property is accessing the length of the match, not the entire string.
