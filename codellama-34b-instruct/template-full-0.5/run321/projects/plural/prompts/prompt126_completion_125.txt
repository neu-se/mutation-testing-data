  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1 || num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the number is equal to 1 or if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the number is not equal to 1 and if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1 && num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if the number is equal to 1 and if it is undefined.

DONE.
