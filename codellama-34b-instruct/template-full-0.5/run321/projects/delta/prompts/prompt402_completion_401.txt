  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===` to check for equality, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `embedType` is not equal to the key of `otherData`, even if it is equal to the key of `thisData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData)[0] !== embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===` to check for equality, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the key of `otherData` is not equal to `embedType`, even if it is equal to the key of `thisData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData)[0] === embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
