  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string "delete" with the string "foo", resulting in the string "deletefoo", which is not a valid property name and would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the string "delete", resulting in the string "delet", which is not a valid property name and would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string "delete" with the number 1, resulting in the string "delete1", which is not a valid property name and would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

DONE.
