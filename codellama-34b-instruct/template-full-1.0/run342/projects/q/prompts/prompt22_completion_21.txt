  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always exit the domain, whereas the original code only exits the domain if it is "isNodeJS."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the exit, whereas the original code only skips the exit if the domain is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain === 'exit'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the exit, whereas the original code only skips the exit if the domain is a specific string.

DONE.
