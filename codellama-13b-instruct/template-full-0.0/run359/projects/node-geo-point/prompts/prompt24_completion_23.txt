  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an own property called "longitude", which is not the same as checking if the object has an own property called "longitude" and "latitude".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an own property called "latitude", which is not the same as checking if the object has an own property called "longitude" and "latitude".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has both an own property called "longitude" and an own property called "latitude", which is not the same as checking if the object has an own property called "long
