  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the `cb` function, which is a callback that is passed as an argument to the `set` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not call the `cb` function, which is a callback that is passed as an argument to the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would call the `cb` function, which is a callback that is passed as an argument to the `set` method, but the callback would not do anything because it is an empty function.

DONE.
