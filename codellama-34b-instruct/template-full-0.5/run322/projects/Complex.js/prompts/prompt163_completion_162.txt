  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a specific value for the case where `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the replaced code always returns `Complex['NAN']`, regardless of the values of `this` and `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a specific value for the case where `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the replaced code always returns `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `this` and `z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a specific value for the case where `this['isZero']()` and `z['isZero']()`, while the replaced code always returns
