  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the array element is different, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the array element is different, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
