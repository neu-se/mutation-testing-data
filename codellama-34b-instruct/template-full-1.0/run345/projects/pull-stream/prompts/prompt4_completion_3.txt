  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would now be iterating over the value of `k` which is a number, rather than an object with properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = throughs.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would now be iterating over the length of the `throughs` array, rather than iterating over the properties of the `throughs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.random() * throughs.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would now be iterating over a random index of the `throughs` array, rather than iterating over the properties of the `throughs` object.

DONE.
