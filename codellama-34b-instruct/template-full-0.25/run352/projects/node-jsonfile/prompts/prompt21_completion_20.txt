  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options`, and it would cause the `readFileSync` function to read the file with a different encoding than the one specified in the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `options`, and it would cause the `readFileSync` function to read the file with a different set of options than the ones specified in the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is not the same as `options`, and it would cause the `readFileSync` function to read the file with a different set of options than the ones specified in the `options` object.

DONE.
