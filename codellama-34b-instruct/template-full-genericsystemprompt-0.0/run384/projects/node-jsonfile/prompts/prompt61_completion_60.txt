  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method returns `true` if the argument is a buffer, and `false` otherwise. By replacing it with `Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false`, we are essentially negating the original condition, which means that the `content` variable will be converted to a UTF-8 string even if it is not a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8') === 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method returns a string representation of the buffer, and the `utf8` encoding is used to convert the buffer to a string. By comparing the result of `toString` to the string `'utf8'`, we are essentially checking if the buffer is already in UTF-8 encoding, and if so, we are not converting it again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('
