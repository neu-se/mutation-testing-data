  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only flushes the write stream if there are still items in the queue or if the stream is waiting for a drain, while the replaced code ends the write stream regardless of these conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only flushes the write stream if there are still items in the queue or if the stream is waiting for a drain, while the replaced code ends the write stream regardless of these conditions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only flushes the write stream if there are still items in the queue or if the stream is waiting for a drain, while the replaced code ends the write stream regardless of these conditions.

DONE.
