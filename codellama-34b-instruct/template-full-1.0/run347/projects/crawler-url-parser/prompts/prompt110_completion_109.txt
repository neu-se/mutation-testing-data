  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set('baseUrlStr', null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds a new key-value pair to the map, whereas `delete` removes a specific key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` sets the size of the map to 0, whereas `delete` removes a specific key-value pair.

DONE.
