  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will close the write stream immediately, whereas the original code uses `end()` with a callback to wait for the stream to be drained before closing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` will close the write stream immediately, whereas the original code uses `end()` with a callback to wait for the stream to be drained before closing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` will pause the write stream, whereas the original code uses `end()` to close the stream.

DONE.
