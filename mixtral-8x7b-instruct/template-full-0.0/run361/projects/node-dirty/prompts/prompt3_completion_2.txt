 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion, allowing values like `null` and empty strings to be considered equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow setting a value to `null`, which was not possible with the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key exists in the map, rather than checking the value associated with the key.

DONE.
