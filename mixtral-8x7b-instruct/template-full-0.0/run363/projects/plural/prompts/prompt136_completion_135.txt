 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `type` variable with a string, which would cause the `plural` function to always return the string 'string' instead of the correct type of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `type` variable with the number 1, which would cause the `plural` function to always return the string '1' instead of the correct type of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function type() { return 'unknown' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `type` variable with a new function that always returns the string 'unknown', which would cause the `plural` function to always return the input word with an added 's' at the end, regardless of the actual type of the input word.

DONE.
