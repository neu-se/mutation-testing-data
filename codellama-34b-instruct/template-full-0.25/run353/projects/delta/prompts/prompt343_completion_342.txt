  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

DONE.
