Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with `false` instead of `true`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the success state in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with the length of the array instead of the first element, which changes the expected output and may cause confusion in the consuming code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Abort'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with an error object instead of a success value, which would indicate a failure instead of a successful operation.

DONE.
