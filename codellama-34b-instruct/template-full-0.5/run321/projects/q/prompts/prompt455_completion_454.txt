  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` is a function that always returns `true`, whereas `!trackUnhandledRejections` would negate that value and return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections.length` is the number of unhandled rejections, and `> 0` would check if there are any unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is an array of reported unhandled rejections, and `> 0` would check if there are any reported unhandled rejections.

DONE.
