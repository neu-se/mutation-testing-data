 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http' + currentUrlStr.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly prepends 'http' to the URL, whereas the original code uses the URL.parse() method which can handle various protocols.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol to 'https' instead of 'http'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://' + Math.random().toString(36).substring(7))
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a random string after 'http://', which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
