  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is called with `undefined` as an argument, which is not a valid value for the `nodeback` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is called with a function that does not have the same behavior as the original `nodeback` function.

DONE.
