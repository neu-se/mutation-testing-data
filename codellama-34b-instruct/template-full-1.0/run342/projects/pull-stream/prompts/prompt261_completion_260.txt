  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` will always be truthy, whereas the original code fragment `cb` may be falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that is not equal to any other value, including itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, whereas the original code fragment `cb` may be truthy.

DONE.
