  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the current object `this` is infinite, not just `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both the current object `this` and `z` are not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this['re'] === 'number' && typeof z['re'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both the real part of the current object `this` and `z` are numeric.

DONE.
