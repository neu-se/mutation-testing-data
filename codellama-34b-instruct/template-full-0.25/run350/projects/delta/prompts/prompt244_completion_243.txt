  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 0 elements, which would not have any effect on the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by -1 elements, which would cause the iterator to go backward and potentially skip over elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by 2 elements, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next element and potentially go out of bounds.

DONE.
