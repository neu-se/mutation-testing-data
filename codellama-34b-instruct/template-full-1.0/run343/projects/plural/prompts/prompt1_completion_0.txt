  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(this).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `this` instead of `obj`, which would affect the outcome of the `toString()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(undefined).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `undefined` instead of `obj`, which would affect the outcome of the `toString()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(null).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `null` instead of `obj`, which would affect the outcome of the `toString()` method.

DONE.
