  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse` returns an object with information about the path, whereas `path.resolve` returns the resolved path. In the original code, `path.resolve` is used to create a new path by resolving the `options.dest` directory and the `decodedBasename` filename. If we replace `path.resolve` with `path.parse`, the resulting path would be an object with information about the `dest` directory and the `decodedBasename` filename, which would likely cause an error in the `request` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` returns a path that is the concatenation of the arguments, whereas `path.resolve` returns a path that is the resolution of the arguments. In the original code, `path.resolve` is used to create a new path by resolving the `options.dest` directory and the `decodedBasename` filename
