  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the forward slash is used as a delimiter for a regular expression, but the backslash is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
':'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the forward slash is used to indicate the start of a regular expression, but the colon is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the forward slash is used as a delimiter for a regular expression in the original code, but it is not used as a delimiter in the replaced code.

DONE.
