  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec` method returns an array with capture groups, whereas the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regex matches the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"world".match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array with the matches, whereas the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regex matches the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method returns a string with all characters lowercased, whereas the `test` method returns a boolean indicating whether the regex matches the string.

DONE.
