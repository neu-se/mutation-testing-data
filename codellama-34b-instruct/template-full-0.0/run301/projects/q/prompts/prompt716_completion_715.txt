  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(null)` calls the `dispatch` function with a `null` context, whereas `this.dispatch` calls the function with the current `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(null, [])` calls the `dispatch` function with a `null` context and an empty array of arguments, whereas `this.dispatch` calls the function with the current `this` context and the original array of arguments.
