  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that returns a promise for the rejection of the original promise. In the original code, `callback` is a function that is executed with the rejection reason as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the wrapped function will return a function that returns the rejection reason as a value, rather than a promise for the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the wrapped function will throw an exception that is the rejection reason, rather than returning a promise for the rejection.

DONE.
