  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the variable `MessageChannel` is defined, and if it is not defined, it will return `undefined`. In the original code, the `typeof` operator is used to check if `MessageChannel` is defined, and if it is, it will use the `MessageChannel` object to create a new message channel. However, if we replace the `typeof` operator with `typeof MessageChannel === "undefined"`, it will check if `MessageChannel` is not defined, and if it is not defined, it will use the `MessageChannel` object to create a new message channel, which will result in an error because `MessageChannel` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the variable `MessageChannel` is an object, and if it is not an object, it will return `undefined`. In the original code
