  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `throughs` object instead of the `sources` object, potentially missing some expected values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sinks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `sinks` object instead of the `sources` object, potentially returning unexpected values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sources.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, potentially returning unexpected values.

DONE.
