  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset calculation would be off by one minute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset calculation would be double the actual offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(min / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset calculation would be halved.

DONE.
