  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0, promises.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a new array with all elements except the last one, which would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise for an array of promises that is one element shorter than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(["dummy promise"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the concat method would return a new array with all elements of the original array plus a new element at the end, which would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise for an array of promises that is one element longer than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the reverse method would return a new array with all elements of the original array in reverse order, which would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise for
