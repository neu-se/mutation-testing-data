  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` would be called twice in the `else` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter()` would be called twice in the `else` branch, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.foo()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.foo()` is not a valid method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
