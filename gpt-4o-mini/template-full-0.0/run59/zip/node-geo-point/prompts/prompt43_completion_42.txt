Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of `point1` instead of `point2`, which would lead to incorrect distance calculations between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the latitude of `point2`, leading to a constant value in the distance calculation, which would not reflect the actual distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the latitude value of `point2` instead of converting it to radians, which would cause the distance calculation to be incorrect due to the lack of proper angular conversion.

DONE.
