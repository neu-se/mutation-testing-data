  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` and `y` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `λ2` are different variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is different from `cosφ2`.

DONE.
