 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the length of the `ops` array as the `start` value, instead of the provided argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `start` value by 1, causing the slice to start at a different index than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(start)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the `start` value down to the nearest integer, potentially changing the starting index for the slice.

DONE.
