This would result in different behavior because `at-1` is not a valid array index and would cause an error to be thrown. The original code `at` is a variable that refers to the index of the unhandled rejection in the `unhandledRejections` array.

```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections.length` returns the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, whereas `at` refers to the specific index of the unhandled rejection in the `un
