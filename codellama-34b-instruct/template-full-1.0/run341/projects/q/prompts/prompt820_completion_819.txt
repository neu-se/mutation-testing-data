  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called twice, instead of once, when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called with a non-error value, which would result in an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, promise, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` callback would be called with a promise instead of a value, and the `progress` callback would be called with the progress of the promise resolution instead of the value.

DONE.
