  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay, and it would cause the `flush` function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds, which is different from the original behavior of executing `flush` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed as soon as possible, and it would cause the `flush` function to be executed as soon as possible, which is different from the original behavior of executing `flush` immediately.

DONE.
