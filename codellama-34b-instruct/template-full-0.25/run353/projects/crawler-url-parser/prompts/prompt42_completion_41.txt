  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would not be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is a string, and would instead be called on the result of the `replace` method, which is a new string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable with a different regular expression, which would result in a different replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would be called on the `baseUrlStr` variable with an empty string
