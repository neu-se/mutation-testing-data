  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array, but null would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array with at least one element, but an empty array would cause a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting an array with the arguments for the Node function, but an array with different values would cause a different error.

DONE.
