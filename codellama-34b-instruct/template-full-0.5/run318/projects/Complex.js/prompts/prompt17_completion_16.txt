  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value when `x` is not equal to `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value when `x` is not equal to `y`.

DONE.
