  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to start from the first element of the `arguments` object instead of the second, which is the expected behavior in the current code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to include the last element of the `arguments` object, which is not expected in the current code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` function to use the length of the `arguments` object instead of the length of the `arguments` object minus the `PLACEHOLDER` value.

DONE.
