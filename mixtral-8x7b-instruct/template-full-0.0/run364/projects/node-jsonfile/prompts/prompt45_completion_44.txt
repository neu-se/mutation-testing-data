 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects the first argument to be an object, but it would receive a boolean value instead. This would likely cause the `stringify` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, 'invalid_option'
