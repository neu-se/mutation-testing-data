  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the second argument instead of the first, which could cause unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the first argument plus one, which could cause unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the first argument multiplied by two, which could cause unexpected results.

DONE.
