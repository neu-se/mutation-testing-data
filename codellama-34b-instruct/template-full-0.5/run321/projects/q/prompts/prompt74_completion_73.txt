  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `setTimeout` is a delay in milliseconds, and passing `1` instead of `0` would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1 millisecond instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a negative value as the second argument to `setTimeout` would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately, but with a negative timeout value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument to `setTimeout` would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately, but with a `null` timeout value.

DONE.
