  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a string, but this change would also match objects, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the result of the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a string, but this change would also match functions, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the result of the check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a string, but this change would also match undefined values, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the result of the check.

DONE.
