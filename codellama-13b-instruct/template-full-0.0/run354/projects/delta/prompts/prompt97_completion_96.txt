  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a negative index, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a zero index, which would not modify the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with a negative index, which would throw an error.

DONE.
