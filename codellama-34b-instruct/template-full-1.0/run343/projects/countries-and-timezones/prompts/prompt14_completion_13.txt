  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] }, [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new property in the `result` object with the same name as an existing property, which is not allowed in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] }, [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `current` property of the `result` object to have a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [] }, [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `all` property of the `result` object to have a different value than the original code fragment.
