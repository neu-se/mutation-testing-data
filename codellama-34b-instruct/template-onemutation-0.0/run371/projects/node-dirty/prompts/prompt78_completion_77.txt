  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only emits an error event if the row is corrupted, while the new code fragment emits an error event regardless of whether the row is corrupted or not.
