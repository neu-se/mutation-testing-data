  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "updomain" when the subdomain of the link URL is longer than the subdomain of the page URL, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len != pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "updomain" when the subdomain of the link URL is not equal to the subdomain of the page URL, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len >= pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This change will cause the `gettype` function to return "updomain" when the subdomain of the link URL is greater than or equal to the subdomain of the page URL, which is the opposite of the original behavior.
