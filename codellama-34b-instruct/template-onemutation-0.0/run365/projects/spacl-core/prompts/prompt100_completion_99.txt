  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `path` is a string, while `path.split('/')[0]` is a string array. This change would cause the `query` method to return a different result, potentially leading to a false positive or false negative in the test suite.

DONE.
