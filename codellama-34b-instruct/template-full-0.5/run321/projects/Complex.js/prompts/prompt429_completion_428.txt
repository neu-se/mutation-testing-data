  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` method is called with a different base (11 instead of 10) and exponent (places instead of 0).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1 || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` method is called with a different exponent (places + 1 instead of 0).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places - 1 || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` method is called with a different exponent (places - 1 instead of 0).

DONE.
