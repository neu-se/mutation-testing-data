  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(value)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Buggy code".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(value)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Buggy code".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.resolve("Buggy code"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(value)`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value "Buggy code
