  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, as `isStopIteration` is a function and cannot be equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, as `isStopIteration` is a function and cannot be equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof isStopIteration === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, as `isStopIteration` is a function.

DONE.
