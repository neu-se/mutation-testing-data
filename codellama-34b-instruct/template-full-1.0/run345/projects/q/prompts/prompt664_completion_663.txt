  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to ignore the first two arguments, which are important for the function's operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use only the first and second arguments, instead of all the arguments that are currently being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use only the first three arguments, instead of all the arguments that are currently being used.

DONE.
