 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof baseUrlStr !== 'undefined' && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a strict equality check for `baseUrlStr`, which would change the evaluation of the condition when `baseUrlStr` is `null` or an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts `baseUrlStr` to a string before checking for illegal characters, which would lead to different results when `baseUrlStr` is a non-string object with a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr || '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for illegal characters in `baseUrlStr` or an empty string if `baseUrlStr` is falsy
