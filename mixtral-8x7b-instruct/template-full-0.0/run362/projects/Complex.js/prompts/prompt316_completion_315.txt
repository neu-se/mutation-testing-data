 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by `d`, which could be zero if the input is a purely imaginary number. Replacing it with `0` would cause a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the reciprocal of `d`. This could lead to different results when `d` is not equal to `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
