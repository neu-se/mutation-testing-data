  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver, whereas `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver, whereas `undefined` is an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` is a function call that returns a node resolver with a null value as an argument.

DONE.
