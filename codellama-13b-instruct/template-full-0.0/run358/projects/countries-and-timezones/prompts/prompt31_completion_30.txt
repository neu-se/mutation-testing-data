  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the hours variable would cause the resulting offset to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the hours variable would cause the resulting offset to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hours * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to the hours variable would cause the resulting offset to be incorrect.

DONE.
