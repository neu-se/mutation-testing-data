  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `void 0` as the `thisp` argument to `fulfilled.apply()`, which is not the same as passing `void 0` as the `thisp` argument to `value.apply(void 0)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a shallow copy of the `array` as the argument to `fulfilled.apply()`, which is not the same as passing the original `array`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `0` as the second argument to `value.apply()` instead of passing `void 0`.

DONE.
