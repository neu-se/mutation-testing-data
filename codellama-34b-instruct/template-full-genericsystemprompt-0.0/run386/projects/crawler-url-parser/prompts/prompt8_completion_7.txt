  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` if the base URL contains illegal characters, even if the current URL is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` if the base URL does not contain illegal characters, even if the current URL is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` if the current URL contains illegal characters, even if the base URL is valid.

DONE.
