  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value of the `value` variable, which is not null. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `null`, the promise would be resolved with `null`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value of the `value` variable, which is not undefined. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `undefined`, the promise would be resolved with `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is resolved with the value of the `value` variable, which is not an empty object. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with an empty object,
