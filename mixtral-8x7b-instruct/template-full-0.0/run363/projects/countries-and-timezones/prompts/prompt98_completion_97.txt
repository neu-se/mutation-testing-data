 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'deprecated' in options
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `deprecated` property is present in the `options` object, rather than checking if it is equal to `true`. This means that even if `options.deprecated` is `false` or not provided, the code will behave differently than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.hasOwnProperty('deprecated')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options` object has a property called `deprecated`, rather than checking if it is equal to `true`. This means that even if `options.deprecated` is `false` or not provided, the code will behave differently than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(options.deprecated) === '[object Boolean]' && options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.deprecated` is a Boolean and if it
