 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `this` keyword, changing the behavior to use the current instance's `concat` method instead of the `Delta` class's `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number between 0 and 1, causing the `concat` method to be skipped or replaced with an empty or partial `Delta` object, depending on the random value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { /* empty arrow function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty arrow function, effectively removing the `concat` method call and causing the `Delta` object to not include the operations from the `other` Delta object.

DONE.
