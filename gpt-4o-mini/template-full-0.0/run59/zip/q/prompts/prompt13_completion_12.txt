Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.isValid()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks a different property (`isValid`) of the `ses` object instead of the `ok()` method, potentially leading to a situation where the condition evaluates to true or false incorrectly based on the actual state of the `ses` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if `ses.ok()` is equal to `false`, which would only pass if `ses.ok()` returns `false`, whereas the original code checks if `ses.ok()` is not true, which could lead to different logical outcomes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines the result of `ses.ok()` with a logical AND operation with `false`, which will always evaluate to `false`, thus bypassing the intended logic of the original check.

DONE.
