  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is now shifted by one element, which could cause the function to access the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs` is now shifted by one element, which could cause the function to access the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseArgs` is now shifted by two elements, which could cause the function to access the wrong argument.

DONE.
