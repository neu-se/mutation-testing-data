  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This change will cause the `then` method to return a resolved promise with the exception as the value, rather than a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This change will cause the `then` method to return a rejected promise with `null` as the reason, rather than the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This change will cause the `then` method to return a rejected promise with a new error object as the reason, rather than the original exception.

DONE.
