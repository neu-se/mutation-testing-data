  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `newOp` object is truthy, which would not be the case if it is replaced with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `newOp` object is truthy, which would not be the case if it is replaced with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `newOp` object is truthy, which would not be the case if it is replaced with an empty object.

DONE.
