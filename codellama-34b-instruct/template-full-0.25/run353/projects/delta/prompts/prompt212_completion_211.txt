  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concat the first op of the other delta, instead of all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty delta, instead of a delta with the concatenated ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only concat the ops of the other delta if its length is even, instead of always concating all ops.

DONE.
