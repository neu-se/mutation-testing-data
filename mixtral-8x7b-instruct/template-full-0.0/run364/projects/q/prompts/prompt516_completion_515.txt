 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise['then']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the bracket notation instead of the dot notation, which might not work as expected if the `promise` object has a property with a name other than "then" that overrides the "then" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.prototype.then.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls the "then" method of the Promise prototype on the `promise` object, which might not work as expected if the `promise` object is not an instance of the Promise constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 0, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `promise` object in a setTimeout function with a delay of 0 milliseconds, which might not work as expected because setTimeout is non-blocking and the
