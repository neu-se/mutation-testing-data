  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the real part of the complex number, while this replacement fragment refers to the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ZERO']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of the complex number, while this replacement fragment always returns a zero complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ONE']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of the complex number, while this replacement fragment always returns a one complex number.

DONE.
