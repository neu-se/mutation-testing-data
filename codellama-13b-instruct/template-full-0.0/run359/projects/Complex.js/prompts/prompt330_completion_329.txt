  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the square of the `b` variable instead of the `b` variable itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be calculating the sine of the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable.

DONE.
