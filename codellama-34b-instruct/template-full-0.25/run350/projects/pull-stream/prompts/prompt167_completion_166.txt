  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `abort` argument to the `abortCb` function if it is truthy, while this modified code fragment always passes `true` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `abort` argument to the `abortCb` function if it is truthy, while this modified code fragment always passes `false` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `abort` argument to the `abortCb` function if it is truthy, while this modified code fragment always passes the negation of the `abort` argument as the first argument.

DONE.
