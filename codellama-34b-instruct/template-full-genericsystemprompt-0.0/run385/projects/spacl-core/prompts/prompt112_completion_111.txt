  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the entries of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys or values.

DONE.
