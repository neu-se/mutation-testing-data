Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the word "man" or "woman" but does not account for the plural form "women", which the original regex does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?men$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly matches "men" instead of "man", leading to incorrect pluralization for the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?m$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the letter "m" or "wom" but fails to match the full words "man" or "woman", thus not handling the pluralization correctly.

DONE.
