  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to try to access the next element in the generator, rather than the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the code to try to access the previous element in the generator, rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the code to try to access the element that is twice the index of the current element in the generator.

DONE.
