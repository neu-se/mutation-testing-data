  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

DONE.
