  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Pre"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" event is used to dispatch a method on the object, while the "pre" event is used to dispatch a method before the object is created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because the code will concatenate the name and nodeArgs variables instead of creating a new array with the name and nodeArgs variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*
```
This would result in different behavior because the code will perform a mathematical operation instead of creating a new array with the name and nodeArgs variables.

DONE.
