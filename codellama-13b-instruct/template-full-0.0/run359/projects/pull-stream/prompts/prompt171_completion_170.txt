  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a function that always returns `false` instead of the original `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a function that always returns `undefined` instead of the original `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a function that always returns `null` instead of the original `true`.

DONE.
