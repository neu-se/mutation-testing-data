  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Testing");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the result of the `getlevel` function, while this code fragment logs the string "Testing".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(getlevel("sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/","sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `getlevel` function, while this code fragment calls the `getlevel` function with the specified arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(gettype("sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd","sub.domain.com/aaa/bbb/ccc"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `gettype` function, while this code fragment calls the `gettype` function with
