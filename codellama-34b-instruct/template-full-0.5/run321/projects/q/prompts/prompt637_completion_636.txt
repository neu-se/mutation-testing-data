  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"clear"
```
This would result in different behavior because "clear" is a different method name than "delete", and would likely cause a different error or behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because "remove" is a different method name than "delete", and would likely cause a different error or behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pop"
```
This would result in different behavior because "pop" is a different method name than "delete", and would likely cause a different error or behavior in the code.

DONE.
