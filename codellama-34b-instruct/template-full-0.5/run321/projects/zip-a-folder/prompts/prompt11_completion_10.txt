  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the input is a glob pattern, but replacing it with a string would cause it to always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the input is a glob pattern, but replacing it with null would cause it to always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the input is a glob pattern, but replacing it with undefined would cause it to always return false.

DONE.
