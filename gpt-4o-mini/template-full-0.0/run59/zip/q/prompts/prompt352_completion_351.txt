Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve("Error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a string message instead of rejecting it with the original exception, which changes the expected flow of error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("An unexpected error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a static string message instead of the original exception, which may not provide the necessary context for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return fulfilled(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the fulfilled callback instead of the rejected callback, which would incorrectly treat an error as a successful resolution, potentially leading to misleading results in promise chains.

DONE.
