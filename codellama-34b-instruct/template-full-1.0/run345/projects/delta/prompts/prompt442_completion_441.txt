  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used to negate the offset value, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Infinity - offset` expression would always evaluate to a finite number, instead of `0` when the offset is greater than `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` method would return the absolute value of the offset, which could be different from the original offset value.

DONE.
