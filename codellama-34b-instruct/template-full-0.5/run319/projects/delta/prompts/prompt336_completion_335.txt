  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code fragment checks if `op.retain` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code fragment checks if `op.retain` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this code fragment checks if `op.retain` is less than 0.

DONE.
