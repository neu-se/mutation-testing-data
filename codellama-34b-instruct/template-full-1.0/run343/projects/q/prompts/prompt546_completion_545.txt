  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be ignored instead of being passed to the `verb` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` and `undefined` are different values, and the `verb` method would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and the `verb` method would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
