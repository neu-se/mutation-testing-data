  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `null` instead of `err`, which may cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `undefined` instead of `err`, which may cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a new error object instead of `err`, which may cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently.

DONE.
