  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute()` function would return `true` if the `options.dest` path is absolute, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `options.dest` path is absolute, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute()` function would return `true` if the `options.url` path is absolute, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `options.url` path is absolute, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This would result
