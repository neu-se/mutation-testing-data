  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` argument is not used in the original code fragment, but it is used in the buggy code fragment. This could cause the test suite to fail if the `priority` argument is not properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority, index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` argument is not used in the original code fragment, but it is used in the buggy code fragment. This could cause the test suite to fail if the `index` argument is not properly handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority, index, other
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other` argument is not used in the original code fragment, but it is used in the buggy code fragment. This could cause the test suite to fail if the `other` argument is not properly handled.

DONE.
