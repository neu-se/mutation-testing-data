  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that takes a promise as an argument, whereas `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` returns a function that takes a callback as an argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that takes a promise as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)` returns a function that takes a callback as an argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that takes a promise as an
