  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code fragment calls the callback with `null` as the error and the accumulated value as the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code fragment calls the callback with the error and `null` as the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code fragment calls the callback with the accumulated value and the error.

DONE.
