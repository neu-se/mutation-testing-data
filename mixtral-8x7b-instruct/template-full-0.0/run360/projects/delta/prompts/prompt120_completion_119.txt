 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always subtracts 0 from the length, regardless of the value of `elem.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always subtracts 1 from the length, even if `elem.delete` is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(elem.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always subtracts the absolute value of `elem.delete` from the length, which could lead to unexpected results if `elem.delete` is negative.

DONE.
