  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is a string. This change could cause the code to produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is truthy, but this replacement checks if it is falsy. This change could cause the code to produce different results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is a function. This change could cause the code to produce different results for certain inputs.

DONE.
