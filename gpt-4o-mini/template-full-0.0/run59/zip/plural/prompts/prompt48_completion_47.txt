Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pluralization rule for words ending in a vowel followed by 'o' to append 'es' instead of 's', which is not the intended pluralization for such words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the pluralization rule to words ending in a consonant followed by 'o', which should not be the case according to the original rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'ss' instead of 's' to words ending in a vowel followed by 'o', leading to incorrect plural forms.

DONE.
