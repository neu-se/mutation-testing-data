  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing operation at the given index with the new operation, rather than inserting the new operation at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the specified index, but the existing operations would not be shifted to the right.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index + 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation after the specified index, but the existing operations would not be shifted to the right.

DONE.
