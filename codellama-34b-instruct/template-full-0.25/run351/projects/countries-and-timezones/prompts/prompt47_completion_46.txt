  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would always be an empty object, even if it was not provided in the original function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would always be null, even if it was not provided in the original function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would always be undefined, even if it was not provided in the original function call.

DONE.
