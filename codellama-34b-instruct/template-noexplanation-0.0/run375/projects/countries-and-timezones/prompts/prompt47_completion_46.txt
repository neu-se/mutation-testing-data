  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, null
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of the expected country object, which will likely cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, {}
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object instead of the expected country object, which will likely cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, options, { id: 'invalid' }
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return an object with an invalid `id` property, which will likely cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
