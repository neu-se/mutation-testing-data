  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` refers to the `arguments` object, but `args[0]` only refers to the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` refers to the second argument, but `args` refers to all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array and does not have a `length` property, but `args` is expected to be an array with a `length` property.

DONE.
