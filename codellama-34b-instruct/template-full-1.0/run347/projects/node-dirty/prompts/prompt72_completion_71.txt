  Sure! Here are three replacement code fragments with different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `100`, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `this._data.size + 1`, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an `error` parameter, which would not occur in the original code.

DONE.
