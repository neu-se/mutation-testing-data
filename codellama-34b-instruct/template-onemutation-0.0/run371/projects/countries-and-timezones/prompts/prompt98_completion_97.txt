  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is equal to `true`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not equal to `true`. This change would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones, depending on whether the `deprecated` property is set to `true` or `false`.
