  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses subtraction, while the replacement code fragment uses addition. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a`, while the replacement code fragment uses the variable `b`. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the variables `r` and `a`, while the replacement code fragment uses the variables `r`, `a`, and `b`. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
