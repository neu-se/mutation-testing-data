  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
... [tzName, options]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error due to the extra ellipsis.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[options, tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the arguments' order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[tzName, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `options` argument to `null`, which could cause issues if the function relies on the `options` argument.
