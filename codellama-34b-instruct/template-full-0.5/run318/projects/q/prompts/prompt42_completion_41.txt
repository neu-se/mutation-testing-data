  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be set to 1 millisecond instead of 0, which would result in the task being executed one millisecond later than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be set to -1 millisecond, which would result in the task being executed immediately instead of being delayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be set to null, which would result in the task being executed immediately instead of being delayed.

DONE.
