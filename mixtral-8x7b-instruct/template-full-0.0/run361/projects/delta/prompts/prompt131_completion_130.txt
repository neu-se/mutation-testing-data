 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a null value to the `ops` array, which might not be handled correctly in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `ops` array, which changes the original logic of adding an element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.unshift(nextOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `nextOp` to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the current position, changing the order of operations.

DONE.
