  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `src` is a glob pattern, while the replaced code fragment would always result in an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `src` is a glob pattern, while the replaced code fragment would always result in the string "hello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `src` is a glob pattern, while the replaced code fragment would always result in `undefined`.

DONE.
