 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{key, val: this._data.get(key) || 'default_value'}
```
This would result in different behavior because if the key is not present in the `_data` object, it will return 'default\_value' instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{key, val: this._data.set(key, this._data.get(key))}
```
This would result in different behavior because it will set the value of the key in the `_data` object to its current value, instead of just returning the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{key, val: this._data.has(key) ? this._data.get(key) : undefined}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the key is present in the `_data` object using `has` method instead of just trying to get the value with `get` method.
