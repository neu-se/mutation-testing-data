 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"1: " + stackLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends a "1: " string to the stackLine, which may cause issues in the filterStackString function that expects specific stack trace formats.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stackLine to uppercase, which may cause issues in the filterStackString function that expects specific stack trace formats.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.stackLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the global variable 'stackLine', which may not have the expected value in the current scope, causing the filterStackString function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
