  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the promise returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])`, which means that the promise will not be rejected if the `dispatch` method throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])`, which means that the promise will be resolved or rejected based on the result of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(function (result) {
