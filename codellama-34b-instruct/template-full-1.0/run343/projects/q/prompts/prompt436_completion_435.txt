  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) !== -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return -2, which would cause the condition to always be `false`, even if the promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return -1, which would cause the condition to always be `true`, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledReasons, reason) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return -1, which would cause the condition to always be `true`, even if the reason was not a rejected promise.

DONE.
