 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for dividing by zero would always be true, causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for dividing by zero would only be true when the second complex number's real part is infinity, which is not the same as checking if either complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for dividing by zero would only be true when the second complex number's imaginary part is infinity, which is not the same as checking if either complex number is infinite.

DONE.
