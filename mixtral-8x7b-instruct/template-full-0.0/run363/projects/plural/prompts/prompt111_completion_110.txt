 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'||'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require two pipes in a row to match the alternation in the regular expression, which is unlikely to occur in the input strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[^']'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a single quote, rather than matching a pipe character. This could cause the regular expression to fail to match input strings that contain pipes, leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\b'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a word boundary, rather than a pipe character. This could cause the regular expression to match input strings in unexpected ways, leading to incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
