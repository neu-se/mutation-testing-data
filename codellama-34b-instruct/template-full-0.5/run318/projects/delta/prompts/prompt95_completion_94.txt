  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would add the new op to the end of the array, whereas `splice` would insert it at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` would add the new op to the beginning of the array, whereas `splice` would insert it at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index - 1, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at the specified index, whereas the original code would insert it at the end of the array.

DONE.
