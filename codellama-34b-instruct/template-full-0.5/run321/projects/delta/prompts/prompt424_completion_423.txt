  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset <= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `<` instead of `<=` which would cause the `offset` to be incremented by `length` even if `offset` is equal to `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset < index || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `||` instead of `&&` which would cause the `offset` to be incremented by `length` even if `priority` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset >= index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `<` instead of `>=` which would cause the `offset` to be incremented by `length` even if `offset` is greater than or equal to `index
