  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`). By removing the protocol using the `replace()` method, the URL will be parsed differently, potentially resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`). By replacing the protocol with `http://` using the `replace()` method, the URL will be parsed differently, potentially resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'https://')
```
