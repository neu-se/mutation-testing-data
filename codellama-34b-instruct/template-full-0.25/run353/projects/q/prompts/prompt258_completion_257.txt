  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, but would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).catch(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, but would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).finally(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, but would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

DONE.
