  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is used to convert degrees to radians, but `point1Rad * Math.PI / 180` would not perform the same conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is used to convert degrees to radians, but `point1Rad + Math.PI / 2` would add pi/2 to the radian value, which would change the resulting angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is used to convert degrees to radians, but `point1Rad * 180 / Math.PI` would convert the radian value back to degrees, which
