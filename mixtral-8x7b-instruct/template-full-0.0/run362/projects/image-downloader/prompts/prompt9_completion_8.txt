 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the empty string would always return false for the `!<PLACEHOLDER>(options.dest)` condition, causing the `url`, `pathname`, `basename`, and `decodedBasename` variables to never be assigned, and the original filename would not be used as the destination filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename

This would cause the `url`, `pathname`, and `basename` variables to be assigned, but the `decodedBasename` variable would not be assigned, and the original filename would not be used as the destination filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.existsSync` checks if a file
