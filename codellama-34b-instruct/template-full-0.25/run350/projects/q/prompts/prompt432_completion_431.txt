  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the object's inspect method, which may not be the same as the state of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the object's inspect method, which may not be the same as the state of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the object's inspect method, which may not be the same as the state of the object itself.

DONE.
