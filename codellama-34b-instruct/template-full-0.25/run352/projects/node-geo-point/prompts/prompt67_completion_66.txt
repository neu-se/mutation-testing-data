  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would negate the value of `y`, causing the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `y` would be increased by 1, causing the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `y` would be doubled, causing the `atan2` function to return a different value.

DONE.
