  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the `nodeArgs` array as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(["dummy"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the `nodeArgs` array with the string "dummy", whereas the original code fragment simply passes the `nodeArgs` array as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array that is the result of applying a function to each element of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the `nodeArgs` array as is.

DONE.
