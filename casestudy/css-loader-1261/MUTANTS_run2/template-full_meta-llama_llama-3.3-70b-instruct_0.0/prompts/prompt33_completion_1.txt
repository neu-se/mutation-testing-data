Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodedURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would encode the normalized URL instead of decoding it, potentially leading to incorrect URL handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unescape(normalizedUrl + "?")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a query parameter to the normalized URL and then unescape it, potentially changing the URL's structure and leading to incorrect processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
normalizedUrl.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character from the normalized URL, potentially altering the URL's path or protocol and leading to incorrect URL handling.

DONE.
