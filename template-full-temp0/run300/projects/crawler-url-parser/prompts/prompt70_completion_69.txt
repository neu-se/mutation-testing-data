  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option would cause Cheerio to parse the input data as XML, rather than HTML, which could lead to different parsing results and potentially cause the `extract` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option would cause Cheerio to not decode HTML entities in the input data, which could lead to different parsing results and potentially cause the `extract` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { lowerCaseTags: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lowerCaseTags` option would cause Cheerio to convert all tag names to lowercase, which could lead to different parsing results and potentially cause the `extract` function
