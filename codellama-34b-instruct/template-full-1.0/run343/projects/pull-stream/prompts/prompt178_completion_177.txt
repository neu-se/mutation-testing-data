  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with a different argument, which could change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with a different argument, which could change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with a different argument, which could change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
