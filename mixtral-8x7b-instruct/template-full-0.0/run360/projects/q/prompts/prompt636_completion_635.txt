 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` is called immediately, instead of in the next tick. This bypasses the asynchronous nature of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is returned directly, instead of resolving it with the result of `promiseDispatch`. This would cause the returned promise to always be in a pending state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is returned instead of the result of `promiseDispatch`. This would cause the returned promise to always be in a fulfilled state with an undefined value.

DONE.
