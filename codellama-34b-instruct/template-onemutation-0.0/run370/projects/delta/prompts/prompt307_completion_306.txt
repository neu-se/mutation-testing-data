  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length =
    typeof thisOp.insert === 'string'
      ? thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start
      : -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the newline character in the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object, while the mutated code fragment uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the newline character in the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object. This could cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently when the `insert` property of the `thisOp` object contains a newline character.

DONE.
