  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr !== _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `&&` operator only checks for truthiness. In this case, if `currentUrlStr` is a string that contains illegal characters, the `!==` operator would return `true`, whereas the `&&` operator would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes(_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes()` method checks if a string contains a specific substring, whereas the `&&` operator checks for truthiness. In this case, if `currentUrlStr` is a string that contains illegal characters, the `includes()` method would return `true`, whereas the `&&` operator would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr.match
