  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the index backwards by `length`, which could lead to a different result when comparing the index to the length of the iterable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the index forward by `length`, which could lead to a different result when comparing the index to the length of the iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the index by `length`, which could lead to a different result when comparing the index to the length of the iterable.

DONE.
