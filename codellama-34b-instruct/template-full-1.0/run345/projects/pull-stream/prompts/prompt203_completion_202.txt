  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a value that is not always less than zero, so the condition would not always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a value that is not always one less than the original value, so the condition would not always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a value that is not always one more than the original value, so the condition would not always be true.

DONE.
