  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, and `options.url` is a property of that object. In the mutated code, the `options` object is being passed as an argument to the `request` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
