  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon is a statement terminator in JavaScript, and it would cause the code to be interpreted differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the pipe character is a bitwise OR operator in JavaScript, and it would cause the code to be interpreted differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the ampersand character is a bitwise AND operator in JavaScript, and it would cause the code to be interpreted differently.

DONE.
