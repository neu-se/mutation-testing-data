  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument passed to `URL.resolve` would cause the method to treat the first argument as a base URL, which would result in a different URL being returned.
