  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `Math.cos(b)` which is the cosine of `b`, but this new code is using `sin(a)` which is the sine of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `Math.cos(b)` which is the cosine of `b`, but this new code is using `Math.sin(b)` which is the sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `a` which is the real part of the complex number, but this new code is using `a + b` which is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
