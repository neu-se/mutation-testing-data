  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pluralf
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name changes, but the function is not defined in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns the lowercase version of the string, rather than the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns the plural form of the string, repeated twice.

DONE.
