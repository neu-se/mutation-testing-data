  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `newOp.attributes` is undefined.

DONE.
