  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is not being checked in the original code, so the `cb` function would always be called with `null` and `data` as arguments, regardless of the value of `last`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!last` condition is negated in the original code, so the `cb` function would always be called with `null` and `data` as arguments, regardless of the value of `last`.

!last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
