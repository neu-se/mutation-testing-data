  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the length is less than 0. This would cause the `any` function to return a rejected promise if the length of the `promises` array is 0 or greater, instead of returning a resolved promise with the value of the first resolved promise.
