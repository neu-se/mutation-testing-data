  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is `Complex['ZERO']`, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is `Complex['INFINITY']`, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && z['isZero']
```
This change will cause the `sub` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is `Complex['INFINITY']` and the dividend is `Complex['ZERO']`, which is incorrect.

DONE.
