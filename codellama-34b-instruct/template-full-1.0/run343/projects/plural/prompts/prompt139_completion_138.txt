  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned string would be empty, instead of the original word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned string would be a lowercased version of the original word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned string would be a slice of the original word, starting from the second character.

DONE.
