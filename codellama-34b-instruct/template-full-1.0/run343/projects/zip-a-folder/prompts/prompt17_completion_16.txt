  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetBasePath` string to uppercase, which is likely not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `targetBasePath` string, and adding 1 to it would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(targetFilePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(targetFilePath)` would return the directory name of the `targetFilePath`, which is likely not intended.

DONE.
