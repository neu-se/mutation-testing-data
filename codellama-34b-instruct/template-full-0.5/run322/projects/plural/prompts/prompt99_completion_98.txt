  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/b/` matches a different character than `/a/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a?/` matches an optional `a`, whereas `/a/` matches a single `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^a]/` matches any character that is not `a`, whereas `/a/` matches only `a`.

DONE.
