  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `baseOp.attributes` object, which could lead to unexpected results if the object is mutated later on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first attribute of the `baseOp.attributes` object, which could lead to incorrect results if the object has multiple attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the length of the `baseOp.attributes` object, which could lead to incorrect results if the object has multiple attributes.

DONE.
