  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator changes the logical negation of `aborted`, which could cause the `if` condition to evaluate to `true` or `false` differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would change the behavior of the `if` condition, which could cause the code to execute differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would change the behavior of the `if` condition, which could cause the code to execute differently than the original code.

DONE.
