  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.splice(0, 0, ...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the new rules at the beginning of the `rules` array instead of appending them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules = rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it overwrites the entire `rules` array with the new rules, rather than appending them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat(rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by concatenating the existing `rules` array with the new `rules` array, rather than mutating the existing array.

DONE.
