 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * elem
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `elem` by 1, which doesn't change the value, but it introduces an unnecessary operation that could potentially affect the behavior of the code if `elem` is a complex object with overloaded operators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `elem` with `null`, which could cause a `TypeError` if `elem` is expected to be an object or a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `elem` with a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which could cause unexpected results in the `changeLength` method if `elem` is expected to be an object or a number.

DONE.
