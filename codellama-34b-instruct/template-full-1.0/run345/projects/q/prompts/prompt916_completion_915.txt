  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Injected error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, instead of resolving with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value `42`, instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Injected progress");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to notify the progress event with a new message, instead of the original message.

DONE.
