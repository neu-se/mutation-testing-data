 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / this['re'] > 1e20
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is extremely close to zero instead of checking if it's infinite or NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the real part for infinity, not the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is(this['re'], Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the more strict `Object.is()` comparison, which would not treat `-0` as equal to `0`.

DONE.
