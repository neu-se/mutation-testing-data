  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e').replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is done in two steps, first replacing 'a' with 'e' and then replacing 'e' with 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, effectively removing the 'a' character.

DONE.
