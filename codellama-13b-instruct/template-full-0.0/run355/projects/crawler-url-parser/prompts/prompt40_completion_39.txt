  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is checked for nullity, which is not the case in the original code. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the input parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is checked for nullity, but the `baseUrlStr` parameter is also checked for nullity. This could potentially cause the function to return a different result, depending on the input parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && !baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is checked for nullity, but the `baseUrlStr` parameter is negated. This could potentially cause the function to return a
