  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function is called with a `false` value, which would cause it to return a list of non-unique items instead of unique items.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !unique(field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the result of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `true`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
