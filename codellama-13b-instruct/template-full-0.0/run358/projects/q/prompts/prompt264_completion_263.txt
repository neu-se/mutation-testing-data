  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called instead of `deferred.fulfill`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would be called instead of `deferred.fulfill`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(value)` function would be called instead of `deferred.fulfill`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the `Q(value)` function instead of the value passed to the `deferred.fulfill` method.

DONE.
