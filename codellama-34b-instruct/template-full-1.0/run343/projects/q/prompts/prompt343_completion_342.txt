  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `then` method to reject the promise instead of fulfilling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (arg) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `then` method to always return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (arg) { throw new Error("Test error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `then` method to always throw an error, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
