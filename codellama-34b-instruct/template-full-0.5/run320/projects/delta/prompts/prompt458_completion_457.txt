  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = offset + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the offset by 1, which would cause the iterator to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index by 1, which would cause the iterator to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = ops.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the ops array starting from the second element, which would cause the iterator to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
