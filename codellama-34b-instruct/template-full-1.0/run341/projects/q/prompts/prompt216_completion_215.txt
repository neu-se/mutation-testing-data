```
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        resolve(value);
    });
```
This would result in different behavior because the code uses `new Promise`, which creates a new promise object regardless of the value of `value`. In the original code, the promise is resolved or rejected based on the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a method that wraps a value in a resolved promise object. In the original code, the promise is resolved or rejected based on the value of `value`, but `Promise.resolve` always returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return Promise.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a method that wraps a value in a rejected promise object. In the original code, the promise is
