 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the last element of the `tokens` array from being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an out-of-bounds error when trying to access the `tokens[i + 1]` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i++, j = 0; j < 10; j++
