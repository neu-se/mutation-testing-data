  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, and it would not cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a truthy value, and it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `42`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
