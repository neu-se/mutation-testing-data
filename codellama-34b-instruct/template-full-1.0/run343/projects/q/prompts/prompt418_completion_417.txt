  Here are three code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code, along with a brief explanation of how each fragment would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var foo = value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var foo = value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add 1 to the `value` variable, which is not the same as the behavior described in the comment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var foo = Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `value`, which is not the same as the behavior described in the comment.

DONE.
