  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` method would not be able to parse the URL correctly, leading to an incorrect parsing of the URL and potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` method would not be able to parse the URL quietly, leading to an incorrect parsing of the URL and potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` method would not be able to parse the URL strictly, leading to an incorrect parsing of the URL and potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
