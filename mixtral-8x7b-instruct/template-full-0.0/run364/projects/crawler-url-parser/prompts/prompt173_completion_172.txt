 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the log level from informational to error, which might not be noticed during testing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
alert
```
This would result in different behavior because it shows an alert dialog, which is not present in the original code and might not be expected by the developers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fetch('https://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a network request to 'https://example.com', which is not related to the original code and might cause unexpected side effects.

DONE.
