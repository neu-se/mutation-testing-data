  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or an immediate reference to observe, but `null` is neither of those things. If the `when` function is called with `null`, it will likely throw an error or return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or an immediate reference to observe, but `undefined` is neither of those things. If the `when` function is called with `undefined`, it will likely throw an error or return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function expects a promise or an immediate reference to observe, but `0` is neither of those things. If the `when` function is called with `0`, it will likely throw an error or return a rejected promise.

DONE.
