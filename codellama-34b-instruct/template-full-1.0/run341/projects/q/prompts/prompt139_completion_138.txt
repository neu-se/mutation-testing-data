  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the error handling block, which would not have been reached in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error handling block to be skipped, since `promise + 1` would no longer be a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error handling block to be skipped, since `promise || true` would always be a truthy value.

DONE.
