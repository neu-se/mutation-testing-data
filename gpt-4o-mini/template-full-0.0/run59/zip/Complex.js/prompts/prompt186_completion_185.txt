Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a`, which would lead to incorrect results when raising a complex number to a power, especially when the exponent is real.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of `a`, which would change the outcome of the power calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results when `a` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to `a`, which would alter the base of the exponentiation, leading to incorrect results when calculating the power of the complex number.

DONE.
