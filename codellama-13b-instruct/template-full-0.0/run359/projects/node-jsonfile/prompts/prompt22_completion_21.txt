  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is called on the `data` variable, which is a string, whereas the original code fragment `stripBom` is called on the `content` variable, which is a buffer. This could cause the `JSON.parse` function to fail if the `data` string contains a BOM character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is called on the `data` variable, which is a buffer, whereas the original code fragment `stripBom` is called on the `content` variable, which is a string. This could cause the `JSON.parse` function to fail if the `data` buffer contains a BOM character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString('utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is called on
