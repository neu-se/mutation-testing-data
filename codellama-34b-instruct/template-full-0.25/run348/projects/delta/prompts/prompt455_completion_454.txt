  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array starting from the current index, while this new code fragment slices the `ops` array starting from the next index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array starting from the current index, while this new code fragment slices the `ops` array starting from the previous index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment slices the `ops` array starting from the current index, while this new code fragment slices the `ops` array starting from two indices ahead of the current index.

DONE.
