  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be set to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the iterator to skip the first element in the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be set to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the iterator to start at the second element in the ops array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the ops array would be set to an empty array, which would cause the iterator to return an empty array instead of the expected ops array.

DONE.
