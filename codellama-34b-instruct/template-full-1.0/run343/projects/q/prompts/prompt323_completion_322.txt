  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that if called with a value or a promise, would resolve the promise returned by `Q.race` with that value or promise, whereas `args` is just a variable that contains an array of arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that if called with a reason, would reject the promise returned by `Q.race` with that reason, whereas `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a value, whereas `args` is just a variable that contains an array of arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
