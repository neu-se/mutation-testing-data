 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped when setting the value in the internal `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.set(key, 'buggy_value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a static string 'buggy\_value' instead of the provided `val` variable, causing data inconsistency.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the key-value pair instead of updating the value when `val` is defined.

DONE.
