 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `[].slice.call` instead of `array_slice`, which may not handle sparse arrays correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.slice` instead of `array_slice`, which may not be available in older browsers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call(arguments.slice, arguments, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.prototype.apply` and `arguments.slice` instead of `array_slice`, which may not handle sparse arrays correctly and may not work in older browsers.

DONE.
