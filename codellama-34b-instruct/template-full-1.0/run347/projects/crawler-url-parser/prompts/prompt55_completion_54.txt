  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
absoluteUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not the same as the `url` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve()` returns a `URL` object, whereas `absoluteUrl` should be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property should never be `null`.

DONE.
