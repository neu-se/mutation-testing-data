  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces randomness into the code, which could cause the test suite to fail in unexpected ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a constant to the value of `a`, which could cause the test suite to fail if the constant is not properly handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts a constant from the value of `a`, which could cause the test suite to fail if the constant is not properly handled.

DONE.
