  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 0
}).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the array to be reversed, which would change the order of the elements and potentially cause the `includes()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 0
}).slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the array, which would change the order of the elements and potentially cause the `includes()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").filter(function (elem, index, array) {
    return elem.length > 0
}).concat(["
