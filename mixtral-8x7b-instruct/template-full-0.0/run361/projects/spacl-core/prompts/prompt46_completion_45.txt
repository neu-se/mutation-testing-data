 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches or `null` if no match is found, while `test` returns a boolean indicating whether or not there is a match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.slice(1).match
