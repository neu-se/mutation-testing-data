  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1, length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length, offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, which would return a different substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset, length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `substr` method to return a different substring.

DONE.
