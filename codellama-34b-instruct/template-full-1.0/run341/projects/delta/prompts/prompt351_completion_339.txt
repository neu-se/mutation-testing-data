  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, so `Object.keys(undefined)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys({})` would return an empty array, so the first key and its value would not be accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is the root of the prototype chain, so `Object.keys(Object.prototype)` would return all the enumerable property names and symbols on the prototype, not just the first one.

DONE.
