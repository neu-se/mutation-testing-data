  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of `Number.isInteger`, causing the `dstOffset` variable to be set to `utcOffset` instead of `null` when `tz.d` is not an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `tz.d` is `NaN` instead of an integer, and would set `dstOffset` to `utcOffset` if it is not an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `tz.d` is a finite number instead of an integer, and would set `dstOffset` to `utcOffset` if it is not a finite number.

DONE.
