  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` to `r` instead of subtracting it, which would change the result of the `sqrt` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `b` from `r` instead of `a`, which would change the result of the `sqrt` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `r` from `a` instead of `a` from `r`, which would change the result of the `sqrt` function.

DONE.
