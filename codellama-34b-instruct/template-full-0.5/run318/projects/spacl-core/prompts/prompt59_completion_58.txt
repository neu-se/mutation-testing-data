  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second capture group is not defined, so the replacement string would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the zero-th capture group is the entire match, not the first capture group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the ampersand `&` in the replacement string refers to the entire match, not the first capture group.

DONE.
