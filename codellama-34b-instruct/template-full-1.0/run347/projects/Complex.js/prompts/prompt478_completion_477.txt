  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a function that checks whether a number is finite, while `!isFinite` is the negation of that function, so it checks whether a number is not finite. This would cause the function to return `true` for numbers that are not finite, such as `NaN` and `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite * isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite * isFinite` is equivalent to `isFinite(isFinite(x))`, which checks whether the number `isFinite` is finite, and then checks whether that result is finite as well. This would cause the function to always return `true`, since `isFinite` is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite + isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite
