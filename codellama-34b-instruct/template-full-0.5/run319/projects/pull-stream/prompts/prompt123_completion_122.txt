  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `end` parameter is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `end` parameter is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `end` parameter is truthy and calls the `cb` function with `end` as an argument, while this replacement calls the `cb` function with `end` as an argument only if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
