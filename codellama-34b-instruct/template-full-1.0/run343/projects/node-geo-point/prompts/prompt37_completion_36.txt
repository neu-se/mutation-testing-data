  Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Here are my three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies the value of `point2Rad` by 2, whereas the original code fragment was using the `+` operator to add the value of `point2Rad` to the variable `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator subtracts 1 from the value of `point2Rad`, whereas the original code fragment was using the `+` operator to add the value of `point2Rad` to the variable `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `point2Rad`, whereas the original code fragment was using the `+` operator to add the
