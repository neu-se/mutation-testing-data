  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `retain` property to be a function, which is not a valid value for the `retain` property in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `retain` property to be a string, which is not a valid value for the `retain` property in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || typeof op.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `retain` property to be undefined, which is not a valid value for the `retain` property in the original code.

DONE.
