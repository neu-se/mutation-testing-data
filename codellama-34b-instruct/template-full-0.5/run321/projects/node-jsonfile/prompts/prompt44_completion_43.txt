  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a string representing the encoding of the file, while `options` is an options object that can contain various properties, including the encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a boolean that indicates whether the function should throw an error if the file cannot be read, while `options` is an options object that can contain various properties, including the encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a function that can be used to transform the data after it has been parsed, while `options` is an options object that can contain various properties, including the encoding.

DONE.
