Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the end, which may lead to incorrect argument ordering when the callback is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value instead of the resolver, which would cause the callback to receive `null` as the last argument instead of the expected resolver function, potentially leading to errors in the callback execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `reject` function instead of the resolver, which would cause the callback to receive the reject function as the last argument, leading to incorrect handling of success and error cases in the callback.

DONE.
