Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly remove only the last character of the word instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "nucleus" which should become "nuclei".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access an index that is out of bounds, resulting in an empty string being returned for the pluralization of words like "nucleus".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first character of the word, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "nucleus" which should become "nuclei", as it would incorrectly return "i" instead.

DONE.
