  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specified reason, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a specified value, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a new promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

DONE.
