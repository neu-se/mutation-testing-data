  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(baseOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the baseOp onto the inverted delta, rather than retaining it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(baseOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the baseOp, rather than pushing it onto the inverted delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(baseOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the baseOp, rather than retaining it.

DONE.
