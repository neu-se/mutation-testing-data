  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code refers to the function `errback`, which is not defined in the provided code. By replacing it with `Null`, the code will throw an error when `errback` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a function to `continuer.bind` that accepts an argument. By replacing it with an empty function, the code will not pass any arguments to `continuer.bind`, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(_, error) => { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code catches the exception and handles it by returning a rejected promise. By replacing it with a function that throws the error, the code will propagate the error to the caller, which could cause the program to crash or handle the error in a different way.
