  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `data.timezones[name]` property exists, rather than checking if the `timezone` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name !== name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `timezone.name` property is not equal to the `name` variable, rather than checking if the `timezone` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone[name] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `timezone[name]` property is equal to `undefined`, rather than checking if the `timezone` variable is falsy.

DONE.
