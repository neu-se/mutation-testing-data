  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the input array is empty, which may cause issues in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length < 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the input array has a negative length, which may cause issues in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value when the input array has only one element, which may cause issues in the calling code.

DONE.
