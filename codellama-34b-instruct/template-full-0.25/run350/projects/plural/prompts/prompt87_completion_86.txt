  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'people'`, which is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'human'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a specific type of person, while the new code fragment is `'human'`, which is a more general term for a person.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'individual'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which is a specific type of person, while the new code fragment is `'individual'`, which is a more general term for a person.

DONE.
