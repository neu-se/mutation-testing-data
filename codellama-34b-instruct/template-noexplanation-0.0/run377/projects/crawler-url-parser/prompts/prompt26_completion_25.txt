  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This change will replace the fragment with a space instead of an empty string, which may cause the regular expression to match a different part of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '\\'
```
This change will replace the fragment with a backslash instead of an empty string, which may cause the regular expression to match a different part of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '\\w+'
```
This change will replace the fragment with a regular expression that matches one or more word characters instead of an empty string, which may cause the regular expression to match a different part of the URL.

DONE.
