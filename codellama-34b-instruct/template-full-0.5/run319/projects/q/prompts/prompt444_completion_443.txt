  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, which would trigger the `unhandledRejection` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null`, which would not trigger the `unhandledRejection` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 42; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `42`, which would not trigger the `unhandledRejection` event.

DONE.
