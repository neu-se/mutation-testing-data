  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved when all promises in an array are resolved, while `none` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved when none of the promises in an array are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved when all promises in an array are resolved, while `any` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved when any of the promises in an array are resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved when all promises in an array are resolved, while `some` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved when some of the promises in an array are resolved.

DONE.
