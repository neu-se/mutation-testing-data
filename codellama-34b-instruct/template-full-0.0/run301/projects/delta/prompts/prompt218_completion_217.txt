  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return an empty delta instead of a delta with the concatenated ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with the concatenated ops, but the `ops` property would be negative, which is not a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a delta with the concatenated ops, but the `ops` property would be infinite, which is not a valid value.

DONE.
