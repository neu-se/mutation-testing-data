  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x, y) => x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because `(x, y) => x + y` is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

DONE.
