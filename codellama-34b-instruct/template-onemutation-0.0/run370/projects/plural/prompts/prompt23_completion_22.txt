  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word, while the new code fragment is only removing the last character.

DONE.
