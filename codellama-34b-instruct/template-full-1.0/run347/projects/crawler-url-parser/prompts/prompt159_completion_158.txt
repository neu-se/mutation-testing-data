  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/[^\/]+$"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches any character that is not a forward slash, instead of matching only the last forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/$"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the end of the string instead of matching the last forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/.$"
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the last forward slash and any character that follows it, instead of matching only the last forward slash.

DONE.
