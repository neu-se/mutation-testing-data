  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the state of the promise to determine if it is pending, while this replacement code would always return a function that does nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the state of the promise to determine if it is pending, while this replacement code would always return a boolean value that is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the state of the promise to determine if it is pending, while this replacement code would always return null, which is not a function.

DONE.
