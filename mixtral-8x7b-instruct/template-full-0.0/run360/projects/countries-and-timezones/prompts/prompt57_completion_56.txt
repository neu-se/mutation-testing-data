 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit `undefined` instead of falsy values, potentially causing issues if a country is set to `null` or `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the property using `hasOwnProperty` instead of direct access, potentially bypassing prototype chain issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.hasOwnProperty(id) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of the property using `hasOwnProperty` and a strict equality comparison, potentially causing issues with truthy/falsy values.

DONE.
