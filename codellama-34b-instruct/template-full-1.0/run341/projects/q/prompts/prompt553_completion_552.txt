  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `done` property of the `result` object, which is not necessarily related to the `value` property that was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method of the `result` object, which is not necessarily related to the `value` property that was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolve` method of the `result` object, which is not necessarily related to the `value` property that was intended.

DONE.
