  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` property is null or undefined, whereas the original code only checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` property does not start with the string "http", whereas the original code only checks if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.url !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` property is not a string, whereas the original code only checks if it is falsy.

DONE.
