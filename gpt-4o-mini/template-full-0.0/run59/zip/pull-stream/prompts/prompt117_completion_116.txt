Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to execute the `else` block when there are not exactly two arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the function is called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `cb` is undefined instead of checking the number of arguments, which could lead to the function returning the `sink` directly even when it should be processing the input differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `if` block only when there are more than two arguments, which is not the intended logic, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly when it receives exactly two arguments.

DONE.
