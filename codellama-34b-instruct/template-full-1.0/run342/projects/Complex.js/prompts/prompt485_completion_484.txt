  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `exports` is an object, which is not the case with the new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `exports` is an object, which it is not in this case. Additionally, this new code fragment would always evaluate to `false` because `exports` is an object and not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `exports` is an object, which it is not in this case. Additionally, this new code fragment would always evaluate to `false` because `exports` is an object and not a function.

DONE.
