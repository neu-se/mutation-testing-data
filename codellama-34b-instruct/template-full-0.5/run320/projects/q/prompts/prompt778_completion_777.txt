  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isFulfilled());
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` will always return a resolved promise, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected. In contrast, the original code fragment `promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)` will return a rejected promise if the original promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isRejected());
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` will always return a rejected promise, regardless of whether the original promise was fulfilled or rejected. In contrast, the original code fragment `promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)` will return a resolved promise if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isPending());
```
This would result in different behavior
