  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This code fragment uses the `g` flag to perform a global search and replace, which may cause unintended consequences if the regular expression is not carefully crafted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i
```
This code fragment uses the `i` flag to perform a case-insensitive search, which may cause unintended consequences if the regular expression is not carefully crafted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/m
```
This code fragment uses the `m` flag to perform a multiline search, which may cause unintended consequences if the regular expression is not carefully crafted.

DONE.
