  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would cause the code to resolve() rather than reject() when an error occurs, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or bugs that are not properly caught.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would cause the code to reject() when the output stream closes, rather than resolve(), which could indicate that the stream was closed prematurely or without proper cleanup.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', output.end()
```
This would cause the code to call output.end() when an error occurs, rather than reject(), which could potentially stop the pipeline altogether.

DONE.
