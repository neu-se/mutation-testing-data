 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be resolved with a null value instead of rejecting the promise. This could cause issues if the consuming code expects the promise to be rejected in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject('Error: Timeout')
```
This would result in different behavior because a specific error message would be used when rejecting the promise. The original code does not specify an error message, so this change could cause the error handling code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(true)
