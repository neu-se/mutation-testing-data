  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the original code used `!=`. This means that if `b` is a non-null object, the mutated code would return `true`, whereas the original code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of a variable, but if the variable is `undefined`, it will return `undefined`, not `'undefined'`. This means that the mutated code would return `true` if `b` is undefined, whereas the original code would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator checks for `falsy` values, meaning values that are equal to `false` when converted to a boolean. This
