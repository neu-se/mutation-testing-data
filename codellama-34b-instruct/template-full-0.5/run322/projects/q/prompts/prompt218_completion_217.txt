  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(null)` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null`, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(undefined)` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with no value.

DONE.
