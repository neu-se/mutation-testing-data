  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.length` would always be truthy, even if the queue is empty, whereas `laterQueue.length` would be falsy if the queue is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.length` would always be falsy, even if the queue is not empty, whereas `laterQueue.length` would be truthy if the queue is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length < 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.length` would always be less than 10, even if the queue is empty, whereas `laterQueue.length` would be greater than or equal to 10 if the queue is empty.

DONE.
