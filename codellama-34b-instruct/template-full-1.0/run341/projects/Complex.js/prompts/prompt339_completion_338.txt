  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 || b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while this replacement code checks if either `a` or `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is equal to 0 and `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement code checks if `a` is equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is equal to 0 and `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement code checks if `a` is not equal to 0 and `b` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
