Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is infinite instead of zero, which would change the condition under which the function returns `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current instance (`this`) is zero instead of checking if `z` is zero, potentially leading to incorrect results when multiplying complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` is zero as a whole, which could lead to returning `Complex['NAN']` under different circumstances.

DONE.
