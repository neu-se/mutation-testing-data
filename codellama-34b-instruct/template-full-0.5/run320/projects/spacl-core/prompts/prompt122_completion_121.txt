  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.search` returns a number indicating the position of the first match, whereas `path.match` returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substring(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character, whereas `path.match` returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace(/\//g, '')` replaces all forward slashes with empty strings, whereas `path.match` returns an array of matches.

DONE.
