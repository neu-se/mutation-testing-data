  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` for all items, even if they have not been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `false` for all items, even if they have not been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, !unique(field, true))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` for all items that have not been seen before, and `false` for all items that have been seen before.

DONE.
