  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is an integer, and it would be inconsistent with the rest of the code, which uses the `attributes` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is only used for insertion operations, and it would be inconsistent with the rest of the code, which uses the `attributes` property for all types of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is only used for insertion operations, and it would be inconsistent with the rest of the code, which uses the `attributes` property for all types of operations.

DONE.
