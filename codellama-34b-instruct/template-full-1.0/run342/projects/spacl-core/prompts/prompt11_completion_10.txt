  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match the string if it starts with a colon, while the original code fragment only matches if it contains a colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match("[&#$*]{3,}") !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string with more than 3 consecutive special characters, while the original code fragment only matches if the string contains a `*` or `+` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any string that only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores, while the original code fragment matches any string that contains a colon.

DONE.
