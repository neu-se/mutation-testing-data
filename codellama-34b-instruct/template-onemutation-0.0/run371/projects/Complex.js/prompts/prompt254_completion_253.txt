  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a)` is a function that returns the value of `e` raised to the power of `a`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the value of `e` raised to the power of the argument passed to it. In the original code, the argument passed to `Math.exp` is `a`, so the two expressions are equivalent. However, if we replace `a` with `Math.exp(a)`, we are effectively raising `e` to the power of `e` raised to the power of `a`, which is a different operation and would result in different behavior.

DONE.
