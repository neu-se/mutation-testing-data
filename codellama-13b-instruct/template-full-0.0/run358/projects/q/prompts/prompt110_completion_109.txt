  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return the index of the first element in the array that is not equal to the given value, rather than the index of the first element that is equal to the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return the index of the first element in the array that is undefined, rather than the index of the first element that is equal to the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return the index of the first element in the array that is null, rather than the index of the first element that is equal to the given value.

DONE.
