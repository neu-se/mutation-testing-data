  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\w+
```
This would result in different behavior because `\w+` matches any word character, including digits and underscores, whereas the original regex matches only letters and spaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[a-zA-Z]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[a-zA-Z]` matches only letters, whereas the original regex also matches spaces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[a-zA-Z0-9]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[a-zA-Z0-9]` matches any letter or digit, whereas the original regex only matches letters and spaces.

DONE.
