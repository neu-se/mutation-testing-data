  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially missing important data or causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would restart from the beginning of the array, potentially causing the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of the index.

DONE.
