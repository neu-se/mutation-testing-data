  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this replacement checks if it is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this replacement checks if it is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
