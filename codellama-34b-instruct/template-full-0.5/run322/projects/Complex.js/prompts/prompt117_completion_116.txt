  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code uses the plus operator, which performs addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code uses the multiplication operator, which performs multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one, whereas the new code uses the subtraction operator, which performs subtraction.

DONE.
