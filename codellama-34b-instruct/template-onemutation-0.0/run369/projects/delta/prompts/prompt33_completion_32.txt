  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which changes the logic of the expression. The `||` operator will return `true` if either of the operands is `true`, while the `&&` operator will only return `true` if both operands are `true`. In this case, the `||` operator will cause the `if` statement to be entered even if `base[key]` is not `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
