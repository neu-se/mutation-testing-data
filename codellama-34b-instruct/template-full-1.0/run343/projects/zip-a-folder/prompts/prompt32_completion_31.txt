  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the event that is being listened to on the `output` stream. Instead of listening for errors, it would listen for the end of the stream, which could result in different behavior if the stream does not emit an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the error handler altogether, which could result in errors being ignored or unhandled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error handler to be called twice, which could result in unexpected behavior or bugs.

DONE.
