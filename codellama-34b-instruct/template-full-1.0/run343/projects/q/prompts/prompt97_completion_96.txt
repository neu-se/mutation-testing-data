  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, even if the array is non-empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, regardless of the length of the array.

DONE.
