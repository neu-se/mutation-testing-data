 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will no longer consider any arguments passed to it, as an empty array will be used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.arguments` is not a standard property and will most likely return `undefined`, causing the `fbound` function to not receive the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because only the first argument will be passed to the `fbound` function, ignoring any additional arguments that might have been intended for the function.

DONE.
