  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
