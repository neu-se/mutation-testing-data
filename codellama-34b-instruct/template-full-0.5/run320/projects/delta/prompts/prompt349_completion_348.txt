  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the base operation, which is not the intended behavior of the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the base operation, but it would also set the `priority` parameter to `true`, which would cause the `invert` method to prioritize the attributes of the base operation over the attributes of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(baseOp.attributes, op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the base operation, but it would also swap the order of the attributes, which would cause the `invert` method to produce different results.
