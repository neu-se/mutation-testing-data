  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `baseUrlStr` to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues if the code is expecting a specific case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in `baseUrlStr`, which could potentially cause issues if the code is expecting a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the `http://` protocol with `https://`, which could potentially cause issues if the code is expecting a specific protocol.

DONE.
