 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the last element of the `tokens` array, potentially causing the parsing of the complex number to be incomplete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i++; i < tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` before checking the condition, causing the loop to skip the first element of the `tokens` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i > -1; i < tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to `i > -1`, which always evaluates to `true`, causing an infinite loop and potential parsing issues.

DONE.
