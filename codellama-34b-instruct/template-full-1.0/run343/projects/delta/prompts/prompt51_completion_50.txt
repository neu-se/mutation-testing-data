  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property string-name pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.keys(newOp)` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names from the `newOp` object, which may be different
