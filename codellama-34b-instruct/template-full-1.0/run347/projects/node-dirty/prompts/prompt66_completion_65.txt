  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()()
```
This would result in an error because the `destroy` method is not a function and cannot be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in a no-op because the `write` method is called with an empty string, which does not modify the state of the `Dirty` object or the underlying file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in the data being deleted from the cache, but the change would not be persisted to the underlying file because the `write` method is not called.

DONE.
