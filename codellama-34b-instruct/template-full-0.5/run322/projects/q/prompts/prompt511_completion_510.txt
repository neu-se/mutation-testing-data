  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `thisp, args` is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JavaScript value that represents the absence of any object value, whereas `thisp, args` is a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"thisp, args"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"thisp, args"` is a valid JavaScript string literal that evaluates to the string "thisp, args", whereas `thisp, args` is a syntax error.

DONE.
