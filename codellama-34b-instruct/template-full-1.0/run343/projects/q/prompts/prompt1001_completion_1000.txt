  Thank you for the detailed instructions and code sample. I understand that I need to replace the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments to test the mutation testing process.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).xysend
```
This would result in different behavior because `xysend` is not a valid method of the Q object, and will throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).property
```
This would result in different behavior because `property` is not a valid method of the Q object, and will throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).method()
```
This would result in different behavior because `method` is not a valid method of the Q object, and will throw a TypeError.

DONE.
