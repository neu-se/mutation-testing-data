  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would return `true` if `b` is `null`, but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== undefined` would return `false` if `b` is `undefined`, but the original code fragment would return `true` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` would return `true` if `b` is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `false`, etc.), but the original code fragment would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
