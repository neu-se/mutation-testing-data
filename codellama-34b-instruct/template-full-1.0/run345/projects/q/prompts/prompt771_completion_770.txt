  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.any(promises).allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first settled promise in the array, while `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promise inspection objects, each describing the state of the corresponding promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(promises).allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of values, each corresponding to the fulfillment value of each promise in the input array, while `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promise inspection objects, each describing the state of the corresponding promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race(promises).allSettled
