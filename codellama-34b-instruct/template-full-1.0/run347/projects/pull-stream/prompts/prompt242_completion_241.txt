  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always be called with `null` as the second argument, even if the `test` function returned `true`. This would cause the `next` function to be called with `end` and `null`, which could cause an error if `next` is not designed to handle `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always be called with an empty string as the second argument, even if the `test` function returned `true`. This would cause the `next` function to be called with `end` and `''`, which could cause an error if `next` is not designed to handle an empty string as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always be called with `undefined` as the first argument, even if the `test
