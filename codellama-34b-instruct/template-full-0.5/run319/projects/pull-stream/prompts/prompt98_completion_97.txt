  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error(), null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an error object, which would cause the test to fail even if the code is working as intended.

DONE.
