  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` method is not called, and the `load` event is not emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {
  this.emit('load', 1);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event is emitted with a different value (1 instead of 0).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {
  this.emit('load', 0);
  this.emit('error', new Error('dummy error'));
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted after the `load` event, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
