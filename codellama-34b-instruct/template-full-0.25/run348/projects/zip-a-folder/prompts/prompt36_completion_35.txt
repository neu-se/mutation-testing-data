  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would cause the output stream to close immediately, whereas `output` would continue to be open and writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write('')` would write an empty string to the output stream, whereas `output` would not write anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('hello')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write('hello')` would write the string 'hello' to the output stream, whereas `output` would not write anything.

DONE.
