  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `!shouldThrow` would invert the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, potentially causing the error to be thrown or not thrown when it should be the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (shouldThrow === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (shouldThrow === true)` would only execute the code inside the `if` statement if `shouldThrow` is strictly equal to `true`, but the original code fragment `if (shouldThrow)` would execute the code inside the `if` statement if `shouldThrow` is truthy, which could be a different behavior if `shouldThrow` is a non-boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (shouldThrow && shouldThrow.includes('.txt'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (shouldThrow && shouldThrow.includes('.txt'))` would only execute the code inside the `if` statement if
