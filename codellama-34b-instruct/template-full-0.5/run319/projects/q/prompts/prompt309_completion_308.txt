  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not called, which would prevent the promise from being rejected and the error from being propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately, rather than being passed to the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with `undefined` as the error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error that does not provide any information about the cause of the rejection.

DONE.
