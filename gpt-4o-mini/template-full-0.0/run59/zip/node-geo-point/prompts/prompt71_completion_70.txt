Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 180 degrees to the bearing calculation, which would incorrectly adjust the bearing by half a circle, leading to an incorrect direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-θ
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the bearing, effectively reversing the direction of the calculated bearing, which would yield an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the bearing value, which would lead to an incorrect bearing that points in a direction that is 720 degrees from the original, effectively wrapping around multiple times.

DONE.
