  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) / Math.exp(-x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine, while this replacement calculates the exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine, while this replacement calculates the hyperbolic sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine, while this replacement calculates the hyperbolic tangent.

DONE.
