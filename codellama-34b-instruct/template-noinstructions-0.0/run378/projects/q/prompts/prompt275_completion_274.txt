  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on `self`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
