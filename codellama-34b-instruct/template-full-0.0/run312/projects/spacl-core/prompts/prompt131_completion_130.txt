  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === null || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop === null` would check if `prop` is null, whereas `prop === undefined` would check if `prop` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `match[index + 1] === prop` would check if `match[index + 1]` is equal to `prop`, whereas `match[index + 1] !== prop` would check if `match[index + 1]` is not equal to `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match[index + 1] === undefined` would check if `match[index + 1]` is undefined, whereas `match[index + 1] !==
