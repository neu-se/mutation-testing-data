  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys returns an array of the keys of an object, while Object.values returns an array of the values of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys returns an array of the keys of an object, while Object.entries returns an array of the key-value pairs of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys returns an array of the keys of an object, while Object.getOwnPropertyNames returns an array of the property names of an object.

DONE.
