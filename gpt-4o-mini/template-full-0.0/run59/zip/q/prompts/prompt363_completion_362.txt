Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler, causing the promise to be resolved with an error instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, which may not be the intended value, leading to potential confusion or errors in subsequent promise chains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `valueOf` method on the promise, which may return a different value based on the promise's state, rather than the intended fulfilled value.

DONE.
