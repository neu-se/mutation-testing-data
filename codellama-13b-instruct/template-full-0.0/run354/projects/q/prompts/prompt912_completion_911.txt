  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first two arguments to the `nodeArgs` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first three arguments to the `nodeArgs` array, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
