  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` using the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality. Using `typeof val === 'undefined'` would only check for the value, and would not differentiate between `undefined` and other falsy values like `null` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` using the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality. Using `val == null` would check for the value `null` or `undefined`, but would not differentiate between `null` and `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` using the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality. Using `!val` would check for any
