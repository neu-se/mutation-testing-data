 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `hasOwnProperty` method from the object, bypassing the `uncurryThis` function. This could lead to issues if the object does not have the `hasOwnProperty` method or if the method behaves differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` context to the `hasOwnProperty` method from the `Array.prototype`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `hasOwnProperty` method relies on the original `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` context
