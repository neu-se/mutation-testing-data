  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` value would be `null` instead of the expected `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` value would be `undefined` instead of the expected `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` value would be an empty object instead of the expected `this` value.

DONE.
