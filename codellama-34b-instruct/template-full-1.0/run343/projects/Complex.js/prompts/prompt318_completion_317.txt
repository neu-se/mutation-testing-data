  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return 0, regardless of the input values for `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a complex number with a real part equal to `a+1` and an imaginary part equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return a complex number with a real part equal to `a*a` and an imaginary part equal to `b`.

DONE.
