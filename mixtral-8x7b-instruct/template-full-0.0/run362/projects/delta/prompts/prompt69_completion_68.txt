 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof length !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for non-number types instead of checking if the length is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for lengths greater than 0 instead of checking if the length is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now check for lengths greater than 1 instead of checking if the length is less than or equal to 0. This would cause the `retain` method to ignore cases where the length is 1, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
