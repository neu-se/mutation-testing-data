  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Infinity` instead of `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `0` instead of `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Infinity` instead of `0`.

DONE.
