  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the .toUpperCase() function will capitalize all letters in the data, thus changing the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100 + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 100 to data will change the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + " extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string " extra" is appended to the data, thus changing the output.

DONE.
