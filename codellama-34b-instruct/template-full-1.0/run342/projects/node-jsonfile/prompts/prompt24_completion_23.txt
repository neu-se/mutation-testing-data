  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<nothing>
```
This would result in different behavior because with `JSON.parse`, the content of the file is parsed as a JSON object, but with `<nothing>`, the function would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` will try to convert the input string to a JSON object, but `string` is not a valid JSON object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` would convert the object to a JSON string, but the code expects a JSON object.

DONE.
