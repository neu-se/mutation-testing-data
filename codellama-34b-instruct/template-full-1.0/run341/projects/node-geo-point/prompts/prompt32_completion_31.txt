  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin()` function has a different range than the `deg2rad()` function and would produce different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos()` function has a different range than the `deg2rad()` function and would produce different results for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan()` function has a different range than the `deg2rad()` function and would produce different results for the same input.

DONE.
