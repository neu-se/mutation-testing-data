  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the wrong iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to return a `Delta` object with a null `ops` property, which would likely cause errors in any code that relies on the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to use the wrong iterator and potentially lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
