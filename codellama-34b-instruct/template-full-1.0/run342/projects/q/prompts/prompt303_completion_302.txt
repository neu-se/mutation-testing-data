  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 10, len = answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would start at index 10 instead of 0, potentially skipping some promises and not all being passed to Q.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, len = answerPs.length + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would iterate for more than the length of the array, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, len = answerPs.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would iterate twice as many times as necessary, potentially causing additional unnecessary computations.

DONE.
