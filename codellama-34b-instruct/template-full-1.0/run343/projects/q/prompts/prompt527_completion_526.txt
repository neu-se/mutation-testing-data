  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `object` is undefined or null, while replacing it with `null` would make the check always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `object` is undefined or null, while replacing it with `undefined` would make the check always return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `object` is undefined or null, while replacing it with `true` would make the check always return true.

DONE.
