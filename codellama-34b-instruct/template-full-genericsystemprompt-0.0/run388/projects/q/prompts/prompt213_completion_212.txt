  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is an instance of the Promise class, which is not the same as checking if it is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value has a `then` method, which is a common way to check if an object is a promise. However, it would not check if the object is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.name === "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the constructor function of the value has the name "Promise", which is not the same as checking if it is a promise-like object.

DONE.
