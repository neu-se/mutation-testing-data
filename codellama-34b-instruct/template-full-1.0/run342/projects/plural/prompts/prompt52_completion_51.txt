  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "o", but the changed fragment matches words that end with any character, which would cause the function to pluralize words that it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with "o", but the changed fragment matches words that contain "o" preceded by a vowel, which would cause the function to pluralize words that it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiou]o[^s]$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end
