  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `a` and `b` values to be reinverted, potentially causing a divide-by-zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `c` and `d` values are equal, but not check if they're both zero, potentially causing a divide-by-zero error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(d) < Math.abs(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the absolute value of `d` is less than the absolute value of `c`, instead of checking if `d` is equal to `0`.

DONE.
