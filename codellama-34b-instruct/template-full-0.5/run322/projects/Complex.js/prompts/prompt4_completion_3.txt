  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a singularity at x=0, while the replaced fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a singularity at x=0, while the replaced fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a singularity at x=0, while the replaced fragment does not.

DONE.
