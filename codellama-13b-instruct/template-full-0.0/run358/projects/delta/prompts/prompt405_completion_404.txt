  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is called with the `embedType` argument, which is a string representing the type of the embed. In the original code, the `getHandler` method is called without any arguments, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is called without any arguments, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType, handler)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is called with two arguments, the `embedType` and the `handler`, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
