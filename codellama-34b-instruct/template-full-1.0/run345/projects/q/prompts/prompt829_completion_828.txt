  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` would not be called with `error` as an argument, and the error would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` would not be called with `error` as an argument, and the error would be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately, rather than being passed to `Q.onerror`.

DONE.
