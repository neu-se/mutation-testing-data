  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches a backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a single forward slash, while the new code fragment matches one or more of the characters in the character class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a single forward slash, while the new code fragment matches one or more characters that are not forward slashes.

DONE.
