  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the code, causing the algorithm to behave unpredictably.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the algorithm to always return 0, even if the input is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the algorithm to always return -1, even if the input is positive.

DONE.
