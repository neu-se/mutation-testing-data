 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length; i--;
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an infinite loop, while the original code fragment iterates only a finite number of times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = '1'; i < length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison in the loop condition is now a string comparison, which would lead to different behavior than the original numeric comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one more time than the original code fragment, which could lead to different behavior in the function.

DONE.
