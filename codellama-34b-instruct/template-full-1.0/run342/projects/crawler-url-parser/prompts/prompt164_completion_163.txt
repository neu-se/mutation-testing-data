  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the link URL path starts with the page URL path, which is not the same as checking if it includes the page URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!startsWith` checks if the link URL path does not start with the page URL path, which is the opposite of checking if it includes the page URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path) && linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the link URL path includes the page URL path, and the index of the page URL path in the link URL path is not 0.

DONE.
