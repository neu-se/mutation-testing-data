  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeStackTraceLong
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function is not defined in the code, and therefore the `rejected` callback would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.makePromise` function is not defined in the code, and therefore the `rejected` callback would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.race` function is not defined in the code, and therefore the `rejected` callback would not be called.

DONE.
