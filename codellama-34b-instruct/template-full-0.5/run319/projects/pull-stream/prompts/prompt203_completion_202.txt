  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which means that the condition would be negated. In this case, the code would be executed even if `end` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which means that the condition would be evaluated as true if both `end` and `true` are defined. In this case, the code would be executed only if `end` is defined and its value is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which means that the condition would be evaluated as true if either `end` or `false` are defined. In this case, the code would be executed only if `end` is defined and its value is truthy, or if `false`
