 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element at the beginning of the array, changing the order of arguments passed to the Node function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.pop
