  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
