  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of the two points. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the latitude of the starting point, rather than the latitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `λ2` are different variables representing the longitude of the two points. Using `λ1` instead of `λ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the longitude of the starting point, rather than the longitude of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and is not related to the latitude or longitude of the two points. Using `Math.PI`
