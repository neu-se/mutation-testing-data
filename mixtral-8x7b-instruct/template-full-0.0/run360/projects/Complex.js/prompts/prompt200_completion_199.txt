 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result would always be positive, regardless of the sign of the original value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the magnitude of the imaginary part of the result would be different, as it would be added to the argument of the sine function instead of being multiplied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
