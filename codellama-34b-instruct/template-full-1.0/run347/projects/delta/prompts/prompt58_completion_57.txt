  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isFrozen
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isFrozen` returns `true` for frozen arrays, but `Array.isArray` returns `true` for any array, even if it is frozen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.isFrozen
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.isFrozen` returns `true` for frozen objects, but `Array.isArray` returns `true` for any array, even if it is frozen.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isSealed
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isSealed` returns `true` for sealed arrays, but `Array.isArray` returns `true` for any array, even if it is sealed.

DONE.
