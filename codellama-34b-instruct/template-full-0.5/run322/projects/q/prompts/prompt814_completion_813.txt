  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given context and arguments, but it does not return a promise. In the original code, `callback.fcall()` is used to call the `callback` function with the given `promise` as an argument, but it does not return a promise. By replacing `callback.fcall()` with `callback.fcall(promise)`, the `promise` object would be passed as an argument to the `callback` function, but the function would not return a promise, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise).then(function () {
    return value;
})
```
