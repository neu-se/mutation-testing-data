  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'mouse' would not match the added rule, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'mice' would match the added rule, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous', 'mous'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'mous' would not match any of the existing rules, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
