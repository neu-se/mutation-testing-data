Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add '0' instead of '1', potentially leading to incorrect imaginary part calculations when the input is expected to be a non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add '2' instead of '1', which would incorrectly increase the imaginary part of the complex number by 1, leading to an incorrect representation of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the sign determined by `minus % 2`, always adding '1' to the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect calculations when the sign should be negative.

DONE.
