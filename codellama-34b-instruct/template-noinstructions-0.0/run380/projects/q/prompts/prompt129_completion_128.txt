  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the key to the `keys` array even if it is not a own property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of the property to the `keys` array instead of the property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the key plus one to the `keys` array instead of the property name.

DONE.
