  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns a boolean value, while `matches` is a method that returns a boolean value and also has a side effect of updating the `rule` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes two arguments, while `matches` takes only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes three arguments, while `matches` takes only two arguments.

DONE.
