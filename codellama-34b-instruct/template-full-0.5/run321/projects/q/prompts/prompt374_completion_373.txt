  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.message` is a string, while `e` is an exception object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack` is a stack trace, while `e` is an exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.name` is a string, while `e` is an exception object.

DONE.
