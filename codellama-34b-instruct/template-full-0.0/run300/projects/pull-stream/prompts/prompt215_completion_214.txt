  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would not call the `abortCb` function, while the new code fragment would call it with the `aborted` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would not call the `abortCb` function with any argument, while the new code fragment would call it with the `err` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` would not call the `abortCb` function at all, while the new code fragment would call it without any argument.

DONE.
