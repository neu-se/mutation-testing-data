  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.delete` is a different property than `elem.insert`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.insert` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different property than `elem.insert`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.insert` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.attributes` is a different property than `elem.insert`, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.insert` is a string.

DONE.
