  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL is parsed as an HTTP URL, while replacing it with 'https://' would parse the URL as an HTTPS URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include the 'www.' subdomain, while replacing it with 'http://www.' would include the subdomain in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include the 'localhost' hostname, while replacing it with 'http://localhost' would include the hostname in the URL.

DONE.
