  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|https:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match URLs with the "https" protocol, which would not have been caught by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match URLs with the "file" protocol, which would not have been caught by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|data:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match URLs with the "data" protocol, which would not have been caught by the original code fragment.

DONE.
