 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of Math.cos, which can lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.exp calculates the base of the natural logarithm (e) raised to the power of the input, which is not equivalent to Math.cos. This would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.random returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which is not equivalent to Math.cos. This would lead to unpredictable results in the distance calculations.

DONE.
