  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an error if `err` is null, while the new code fragment would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment would throw an error with a generic message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an error if `err` is undefined, while the new code fragment would not throw an error.

DONE.
