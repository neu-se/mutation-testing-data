  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with `null` instead of `data`, which could cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with `undefined` instead of `data`, which could cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with the string `"foo"` instead of `data`, which could cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

DONE.
