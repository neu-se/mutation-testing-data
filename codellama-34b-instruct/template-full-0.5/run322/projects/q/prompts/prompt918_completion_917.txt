  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes a Node-style callback, while the modified code fragment returns a bound function that takes no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes a Node-style callback, while the modified code fragment returns a function that takes no arguments and immediately calls the Node-style callback with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes a Node-style callback, while the modified code fragment returns a function that takes no arguments and immediately calls the Node-style callback with no arguments.

DONE.
