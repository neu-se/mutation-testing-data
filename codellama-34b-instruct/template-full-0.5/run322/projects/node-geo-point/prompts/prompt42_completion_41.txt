  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sin` to calculate the bearing, while `cos` would calculate the bearing using the cosine of the angle between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sin` to calculate the bearing, while `tan` would calculate the bearing using the tangent of the angle between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sin` to calculate the bearing, while `acos` would calculate the bearing using the inverse cosine of the angle between the two points.

DONE.
