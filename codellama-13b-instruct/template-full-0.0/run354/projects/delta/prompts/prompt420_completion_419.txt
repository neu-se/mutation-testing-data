  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.max` function returns the largest of two or more numbers, whereas the `Math.min` function returns the smallest. If the `Math.max` function is used instead, the `transformPosition` method would return a larger index than the original code, which could cause issues in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas the `Math.min` function returns the smallest. If the `Math.floor` function is used instead, the `transformPosition` method would return a smaller index than the original code, which could cause issues in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or
