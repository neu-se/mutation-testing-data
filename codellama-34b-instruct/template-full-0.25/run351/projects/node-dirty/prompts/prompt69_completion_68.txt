  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `1`, which is different from the original code where the value is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value that is one greater than the actual size of the data, which could cause confusion and errors in the code that is handling the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value that is one less than the actual size of the data, which could cause confusion and errors in the code that is handling the `load` event
