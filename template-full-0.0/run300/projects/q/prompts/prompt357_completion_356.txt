  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, and passing a new `Error` object would cause the function to return a rejected promise with the new error object as its reason.

DONE.
