  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments.length` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if it is greater than 1. This would cause the `basis` variable to be initialized to `this[index++]` instead of `undefined` when the `arguments.length` is greater than 1, which could lead to different behavior in the `reduce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments.length` is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if it is less than 1. This would cause the `basis` variable to be initialized to `this[index++]` instead of `undefined` when the `arguments.length` is less than 1, which could lead to different behavior in the `reduce` function.
