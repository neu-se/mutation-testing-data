  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if the `length` is negative, regardless of the type of the `length` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0 && constant
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if the `length` is negative and the `constant` is truthy, regardless of the type of the `length` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0 || constant
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if the `length` is negative and the `constant` is falsy, regardless of the type of the `length` value.

DONE.
