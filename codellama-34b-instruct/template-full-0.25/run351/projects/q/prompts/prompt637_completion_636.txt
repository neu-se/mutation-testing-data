  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the strings "delete" and "foo", resulting in the string "deletefoo", which is not a valid property name and would cause a different error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the string "delete", resulting in the number 0, which is not a valid property name and would cause a different error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the string "delete" by 2, resulting in the string "deletedelete", which is not a valid property name and would cause a different error to be thrown.

DONE.
