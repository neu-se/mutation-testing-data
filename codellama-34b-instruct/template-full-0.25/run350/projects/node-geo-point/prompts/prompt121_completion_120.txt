  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
