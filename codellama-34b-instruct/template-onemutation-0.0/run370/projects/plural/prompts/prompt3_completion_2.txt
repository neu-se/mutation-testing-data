  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was subtracting 1 from the length of the string, while the new code fragment is subtracting 2. This would cause the function to return a different substring, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
