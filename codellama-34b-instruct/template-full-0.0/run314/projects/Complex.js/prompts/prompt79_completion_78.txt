  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === '+'` would cause the parser to treat the plus sign as a valid separator, even if it is not followed by a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === 'i'` would cause the parser to treat the letter "i" as a valid separator, even if it is not followed by a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === 'e'` would cause the parser to treat the letter "e" as a valid separator, even if it
