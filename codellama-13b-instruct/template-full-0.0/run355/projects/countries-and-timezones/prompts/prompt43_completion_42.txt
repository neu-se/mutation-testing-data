  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `getCountry` function to retrieve the country object for the given ID, while the buggy code fragment uses the `getCountry` function to retrieve the country object for the given ID and then assigns it to the `prev` object. This would result in the `prev` object containing the country object for the given ID, rather than the original code fragment, which would result in the `prev` object containing the country object for the given ID and the `getCountry` function.
