  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of a URL object, causing the function to fail when it tries to access properties of the `parsedUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl = { url: 'invalid url' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return an object with a `url` property that is not a valid URL, causing the function to fail when it tries to use the `url` property to extract information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol = 'invalid protocol';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a URL object with an invalid protocol, causing the function to fail when it tries to use the `protocol` property to extract information.

DONE.
