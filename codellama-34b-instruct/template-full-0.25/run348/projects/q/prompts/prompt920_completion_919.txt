  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not contain any error handling, while this replacement code fragment would cause the promise to be rejected with an error message "something went wrong".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the value of the `value` variable, while this replacement code fragment would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("something happened");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not contain any notification handling, while this replacement code fragment would cause the promise to be notified with the message "something happened".

DONE.
