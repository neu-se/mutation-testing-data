  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
        if (done) {
            return;
        }
        done = true;

        deferred.resolve(fulfilled(value));
    }, "when", [
        function (exception) {
            if (done) {
                return;
            }
            done = true;

            deferred.resolve(rejected(exception));
        }
    ]);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` is used to ensure that the callbacks are invoked asynchronously, which can cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different value or reason than what was originally intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var resolved = false;
deferred.resolve(Q.all(
    self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
        if (!resolved) {
            resolved = true;
            return ful
