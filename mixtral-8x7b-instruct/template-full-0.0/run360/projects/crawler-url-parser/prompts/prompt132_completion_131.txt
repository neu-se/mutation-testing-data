 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-z]+\.default$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the 'default' keyword at the beginning of the URL path instead of the end, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/default\..+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that has 'default.' followed by one or more characters at the end of the URL path, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any two-word string where the second word ends with a period at the end of the URL path, which is different from the original behavior that specifically matches 'default.'.

DONE.
