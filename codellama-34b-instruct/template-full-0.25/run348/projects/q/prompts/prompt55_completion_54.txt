  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return the same value for all objects, and the `process` object is not a built-in JavaScript object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString(<PLACEHOLDER>) === "[object Object]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not guaranteed to return the same value for all objects, and the `process` object is not a built-in JavaScript object.

DONE.
