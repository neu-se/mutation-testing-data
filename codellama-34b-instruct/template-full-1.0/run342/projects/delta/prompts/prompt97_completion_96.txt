  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += Op.length(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is not defined in the provided code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += newOp.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.length` is not defined in the provided code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the `index` by 1, regardless of the length of the `newOp`.

DONE.
