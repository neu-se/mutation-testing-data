  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === true) {
  once()
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `once` function regardless of the value of `end`, while this modified code only calls `once` if `end` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end !== true) {
  once()
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `once` function regardless of the value of `end`, while this modified code only calls `once` if `end` is not `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === false) {
  once()
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `once` function regardless of the value of `end`, while this modified code only calls `once` if `end` is `false`.

DONE.
