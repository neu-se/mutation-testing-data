  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isInfinite()` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isNaN()` instead of `isInfinite()` would cause the `toString()` method to return "NaN" for any complex number that is not a number, rather than "Infinity" for any complex number that is infinite.
