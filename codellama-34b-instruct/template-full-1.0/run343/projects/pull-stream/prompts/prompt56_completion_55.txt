  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice` modifies the original array, while `arr.push` returns a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.concat` returns a new array, while `arr.push` modifies the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array, while `arr.push` modifies the original array.

DONE.
