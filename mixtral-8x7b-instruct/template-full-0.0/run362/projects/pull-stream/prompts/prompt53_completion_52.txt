 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the 's' variable in the global 'window' object, instead of checking if 's' is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 's' is an instance of the built-in Object constructor, instead of checking if 's' is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(s)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 's' is an Array, instead of checking if 's' is an object.

DONE.
