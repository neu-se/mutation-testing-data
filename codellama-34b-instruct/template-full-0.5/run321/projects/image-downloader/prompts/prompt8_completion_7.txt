  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) !== '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is not '.jpg'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest).length > 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is longer than 3 characters.

DONE.
