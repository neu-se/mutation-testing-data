  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "ices" to the input word, while this code fragment appends "ies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ys' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "ices" to the input word, while this code fragment appends "ys".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "ices" to the input word, while this code fragment appends "es".

DONE.
