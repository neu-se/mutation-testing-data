  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is used to pass the result of the `map` function to the callback, while `null` would pass a null value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` passes the value of the `data` parameter to the callback, while `delete data` would remove the `data` parameter from the function call entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` passes the value of the `data` parameter to the callback, while `data + 1` would pass the value of `data` plus 1 to the callback.

DONE.
