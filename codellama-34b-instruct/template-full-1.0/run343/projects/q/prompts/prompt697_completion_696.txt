  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would include all the arguments after the first two, while `arguments` would include all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(2)` would include all the arguments after the first two, while `arguments` would include all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...args].slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[...args].slice(2)` would include all the arguments after the first two, while `arguments` would include all the arguments.

DONE.
