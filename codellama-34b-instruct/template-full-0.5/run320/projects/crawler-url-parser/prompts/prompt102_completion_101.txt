  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
