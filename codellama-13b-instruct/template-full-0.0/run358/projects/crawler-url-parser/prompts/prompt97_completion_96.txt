  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object is not guaranteed to have a property called `url`. If the `currentUrl` object does not have a property called `url`, the code will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object is guaranteed to have a property called `url`. If the `currentUrl` object does not have a property called `url`, the code will return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object is guaranteed to have a property called `url`. If the `currentUrl` object does not have a property called `url`, the code will return `null`.

DONE.
