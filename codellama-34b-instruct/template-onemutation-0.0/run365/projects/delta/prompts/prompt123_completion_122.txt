  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a less-than operator, which would stop the loop when `index` is equal to `end`, but the new code uses a less-than-or-equal-to operator, which would allow the loop to continue if `index` is equal to `end`. This could potentially cause the loop to iterate one extra time, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
