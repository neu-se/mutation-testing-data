  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while this code fragment checks if `aborted` is false. If `aborted` is false, the code would execute the if statement, which would cause the function to return `aborted` instead of `null` or `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while this code fragment checks if `aborted` is not equal to 0. If `aborted` is not equal to 0, the code would execute the if statement, which would cause the function to return `aborted` instead of `null` or `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(aborted + Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true,
