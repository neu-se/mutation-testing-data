  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `aborted`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `aborted` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is not an array or string, so it does not have a `length` property. This would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is not a string, so calling `toString()` on it would return a string representation of the object, which would be different from the original `aborted` value.

DONE.
