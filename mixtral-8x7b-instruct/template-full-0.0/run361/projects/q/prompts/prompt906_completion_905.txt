 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined`, but this change would allow any non-null value for the `callback` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof callback === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined`, but this change would only allow a function for the `callback` variable, potentially causing issues if a non-function value is passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback && typeof callback === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined`, but this change would allow falsy values (e.g., `0`, `''`, `null`, or `false`) and only allow a function for the `callback` variable if it is not falsy.

DONE.
