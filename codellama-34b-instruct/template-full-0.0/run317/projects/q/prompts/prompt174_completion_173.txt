  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the line number, rather than concatenating the string "line" with the string "1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the line number, rather than concatenating the string "line" with the string "1".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the line number by 2, rather than concatenating the string "line" with the string "1".

DONE.
