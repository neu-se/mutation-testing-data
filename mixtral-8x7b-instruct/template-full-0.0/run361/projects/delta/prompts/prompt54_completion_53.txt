 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ops` is an instance of `Array`, which is not equivalent to the original `Array.isArray(ops)` check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops.constructor === Array
