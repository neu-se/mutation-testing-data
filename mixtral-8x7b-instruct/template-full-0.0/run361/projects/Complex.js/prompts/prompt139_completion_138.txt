 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the 're' property of 'z' with Infinity, instead of checking if either 'z' or the current complex number is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'z' is an infinite complex number using a method call, instead of checking if its 're' or 'im' properties are Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'Complex.INFINITY' when subtracting two complex numbers if the 'sub' method receives Infinity as one of its arguments, regardless of the other argument's value.

DONE.
