  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire array, even if the array is sparse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire array, even if the array is sparse.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire array, even if the array is sparse.

DONE.
