  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the new element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the new element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, while `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array and the new element.

DONE.
