 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^\\/\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslashes need to be escaped in JavaScript string literals.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the caret (^) is missing, which means it would match any string that contains '//' instead of only matching at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'^[/][/]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is written using character classes, which would not match the intended pattern.

DONE.
