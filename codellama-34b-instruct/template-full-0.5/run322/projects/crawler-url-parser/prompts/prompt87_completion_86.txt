  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `text()` method to get the text content of the element, while this code uses the `text` property, which may return a different value if the element has child elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toLowerCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the text content, while this code converts the text to lowercase, which may cause the `includes` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/g, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not modify the text content, while this code removes all non-alphanumeric characters, which may
