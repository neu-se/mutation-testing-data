  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor['valueOf'] = function () {
            var inspected = inspect();
            if (inspected.state === "pending" ||
                inspected.state === "rejected") {
                return promise;
            }
            return inspected.value;
        };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would be overwritten, which could cause issues with the promise's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor['inspect'] = function (inspected) {
            if (inspected.state === "rejected") {
                return "rejected";
            } else {
                return "pending";
            }
        };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be overwritten, which could cause issues with the promise's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor['reject'] = function (reason)
