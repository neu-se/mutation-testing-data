  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 hour to the offset, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 hour from the offset, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the offset, which would change the resulting offset string.

DONE.
