  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true` in the original code, which means that the `untrackRejection` function is called when a promise is rejected. In the modified code, the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `false`, which means that the `untrackRejection` function is not called when a promise is rejected. This could result in different behavior if the `untrackRejection` function has side effects that are important for the correct operation of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `false` in the original code, which means that the `untrackRejection` function is not called when a promise is rejected. In the modified code, the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is set to `true`, which means that the `unt
