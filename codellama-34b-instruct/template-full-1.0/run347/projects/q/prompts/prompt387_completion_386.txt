  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because without a value, the `thenResolve()` method would not be able to perform its intended function of resolving the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value is different from the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` property of the `value` object may not exist, which would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
