  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length < 0` would return `false` if `attributes` is an empty object, whereas `Object.keys(attributes).length > 0` would return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(attributes).length > 0` would return `true` if any property of `attributes` is not `null` or `undefined`, whereas `Object.keys(attributes).length > 0` would only return `true` if there are any keys in `attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.values(attributes).every(x => typeof x === 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Object.values(attributes).every(x => typeof x ===
