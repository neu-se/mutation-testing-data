  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain =
  typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of `thisOp` to be set to the value of `otherOp.retain`, which is a number, instead of the value of `length`, which is a string. This would cause the `retain` property to be set to a different value than the original code, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
