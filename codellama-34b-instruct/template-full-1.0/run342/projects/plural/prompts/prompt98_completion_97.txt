  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/^aeiouy/i, 'aeiouy')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching on the start of the word, which would change the result of the replace method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/aeiouy$/i, 'aeiouy')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching on the end of the word, which would change the result of the replace method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/aeiouy/ig, 'aeiouy')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive and global, which would change the result of the replace method.

DONE.
