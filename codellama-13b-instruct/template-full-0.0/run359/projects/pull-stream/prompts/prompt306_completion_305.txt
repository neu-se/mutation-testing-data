  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `ended = ended || end` would be evaluated as `ended = (ended || end) && end`, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `ended = ended || end` would be evaluated as `ended = (ended || !end) || end`, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `ended = ended || end` would be evaluated as `ended = (ended && !end
