  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current URL instead of the base URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL parsing function to return null, which could lead to errors in the code that uses the parsed URL.

DONE.
