  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to throw an error, which would in turn cause the `nfcall` method to reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to return a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`, which would in turn cause the `nfcall` method to resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err) { throw err; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
