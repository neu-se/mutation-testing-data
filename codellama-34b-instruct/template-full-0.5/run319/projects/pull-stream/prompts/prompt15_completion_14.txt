  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is always initialized to an empty array, so the check `args == null` would always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is always initialized to an empty array, so the check `args.length > 0` would always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is always initialized to a function, so the check `read == null` would always fail.

DONE.
