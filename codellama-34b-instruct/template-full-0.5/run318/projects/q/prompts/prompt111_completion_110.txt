  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `collect.pop` would remove the last element from the `collect` array instead of adding an element to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `collect.shift` would remove the first element from the `collect` array instead of adding an element to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `collect.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the `collect` array instead of the end.

DONE.
