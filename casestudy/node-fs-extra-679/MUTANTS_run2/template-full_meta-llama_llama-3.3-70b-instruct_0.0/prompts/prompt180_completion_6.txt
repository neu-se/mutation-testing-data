Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path, including the root directory. Using `path.dirname` would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a constructor function that returns a string object, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path. Using `String` would cause a TypeError when trying to access the `root` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(x) { return x }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function returns the input `destParent` as is, without parsing it, whereas `path.parse` returns an object containing information about the path. Using this function would cause the function to incorrectly check if the destination parent is the root directory, as it would be comparing the full path with the root directory.

DONE.
