  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array + 1` would return a new array with the values of `array` increased by 1, whereas `array` by itself would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` would return the number of elements in the `array`, whereas `array` by itself would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array[0]` would return the first element of the `array`, whereas `array` by itself would return the original array.

DONE.
