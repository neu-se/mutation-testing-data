  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return the first truthy value, so if `currentUrl` is falsy, it will return `currentUrl.url`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will return the first falsy value, so if `currentUrl` is falsy, it will return `currentUrl`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl ? currentUrl.url : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator will return `null` if `currentUrl` is falsy, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
