  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be increased by 1, which could cause the loop to iterate one extra time and potentially access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be decreased by 1, which could cause the loop to skip over the last character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be halved, which could cause the loop to iterate over half of the string and potentially miss some characters.

DONE.
