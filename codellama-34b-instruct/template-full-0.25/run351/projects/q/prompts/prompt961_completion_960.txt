  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `1` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `-1` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
