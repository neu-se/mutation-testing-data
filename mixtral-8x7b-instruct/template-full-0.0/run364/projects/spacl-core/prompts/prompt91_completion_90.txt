 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop will not iterate over any policies, and no new policies will be added to the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would enter an infinite recursion loop, adding the same policies repeatedly to the `PolicyMap` until it reaches the maximum call stack size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<Policy[]>[]).concat(policies)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new empty array, converts it to a `Policy[]` type, concatenates the existing `policies` array, and iterates over the resulting array. This would cause the `push` method to add any duplicate policy names to the `PolicyMap` again, potentially modifying the behavior of the application.

DONE.
