  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise instead of the promise itself, which could cause the `then` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the primitive value of the promise instead of the promise itself, which could cause the `then` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the promise instead of the promise itself, which could cause the `then` method to fail.

DONE.
