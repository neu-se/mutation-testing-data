  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` operator would return "string" when the value is a string, which would cause the conditional statement to evaluate to `false` even when the value of `thisOp.retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for loose equality, which means it would return `true` even when the value of `thisOp.retain` is a number or a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript, and it is not equal to any other value, including `null`.

DONE.
