 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes an empty string into the delta instead of the 'delete' Op, potentially affecting the transformation result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes null into the delta instead of the 'delete' Op, potentially causing issues when processing the delta further.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherOp.delete = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the 'delete' property of the otherOp to false, which might prevent the correct handling of deletions in the transformation process.

DONE.
