  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'types'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of the property `'type'` in the `point` object, but if it is replaced with `'types'`, the check will fail and the code will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'lat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of the property `'type'` in the `point` object, but if it is replaced with `'lat'`, the check will pass and the code will assume that the `point` object contains a `latitude` value, even if it doesn't. This can cause errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `GeoPoint` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'lng'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of the property `'type'` in the `point` object, but if it is replaced with `'
