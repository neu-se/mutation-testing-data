 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apPLY"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison for the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the `fcall` method to always resolve or reject without invoking the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"applyShim"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not recognize the string, causing the `fcall` method to always resolve without invoking the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"splice"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would receive an unexpected argument, causing the `fcall` method to throw an exception and reject the promise.

DONE.
