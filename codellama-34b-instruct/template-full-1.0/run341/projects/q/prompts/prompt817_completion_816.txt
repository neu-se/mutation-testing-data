  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will now be returned as rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will now return a null value instead of a value defined by the `fulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("deliberate mutation")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will now throw a new error instead of returning a value.

DONE.
