  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is called on a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this.longitude, this.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is called with different arguments.

DONE.
