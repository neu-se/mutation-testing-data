 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now always returns 1, instead of the parsed JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parsed JSON data is converted to a string, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse('{"key": "value"}')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now always returns the hardcoded JSON object, instead of the contents of the specified file.

DONE.
