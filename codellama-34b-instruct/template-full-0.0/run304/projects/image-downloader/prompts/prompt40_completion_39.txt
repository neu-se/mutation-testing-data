  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong_dest' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the file to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the file to be written with a different extension than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the file to be written with a different encoding than expected.

DONE.
