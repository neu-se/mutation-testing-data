  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `count` variable is always positive, so the condition would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `count` variable is always positive, so the condition would never be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `count` variable is always positive, so the condition would never be true.

DONE.
