  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.end()` would immediately close the write stream, without waiting for the buffer to be flushed, which could result in data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.write('')` would write an empty string to the write stream, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.cork()` would prevent the write stream from being flushed, which could result in data being buffered indefinitely.

DONE.
