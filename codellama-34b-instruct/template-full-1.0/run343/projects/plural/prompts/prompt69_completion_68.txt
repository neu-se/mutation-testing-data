  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'laptop', 'laptops'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would expect the original code fragment, `['memo', 'memos']`, to produce the output `['memo', 'memos']`, but the mutated code fragment, `['laptop', 'laptops']`, would produce the output `['laptop', 'laptops']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memories'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would expect the original code fragment, `['memo', 'memos']`, to produce the output `['memo', 'memos']`, but the mutated code fragment, `['memo', 'memories']`, would produce the output `['memo', 'memos']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'meme', 'memes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would expect the original
