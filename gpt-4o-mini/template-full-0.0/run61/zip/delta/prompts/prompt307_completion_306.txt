Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method of checking the length of the `line` Delta object from a property access to a method call, which may not exist, potentially leading to a runtime error instead of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for the case where the length is exactly zero to pass the condition, which may lead to unintended execution of the predicate function even when there are no elements in `line`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the execution of the predicate function to only when there is exactly one element in `line`, potentially skipping valid cases where `line` has more than one element.

DONE.
