  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would no longer emit an `'error'` event if there was an error during the compression process, making it harder to detect and handle errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would no longer emit a `'close'` event when the compression is finished, making it harder to determine when the compression is complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'pipe'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would no longer emit a `'pipe'` event when data is being piped into the stream, making it harder to monitor the progress of the compression.

DONE.
