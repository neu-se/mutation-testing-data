Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
          buffer = arr.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle the case where the last line of the buffer is empty, potentially leading to an incorrect state where an empty line is processed as valid data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
          buffer = arr.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop(1)` is not a valid argument for the `pop` method, which would lead to an error or unexpected behavior, causing the application to crash or skip processing the last line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
          buffer = arr.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array instead of the last, which would lead to incorrect data being retained in the buffer and potentially cause the wrong rows to be processed.

DONE.
