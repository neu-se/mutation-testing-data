  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` checks if the map has the specified key, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.size` returns the number of elements in the map, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.keys` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, whereas `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

DONE.
