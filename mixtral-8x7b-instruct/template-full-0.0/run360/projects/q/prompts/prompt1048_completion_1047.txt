 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` object would not have a `head` property, causing an error when trying to access it in the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` object would not have a `head` property with the error message, causing an error when trying to access it in the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the queue would not reject the promise when closed, but instead resolve it, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
