  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement would treat `null` as an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement would treat `undefined` as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement would treat the string `'object'` as an object.

DONE.
