  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` would concatenate the `args` array with an empty array, effectively creating a copy of the `args` array. The original code passes `name` and `args` as separate arguments to `Q(object).npost()`, while the modified code passes `name` and the concatenation of `args` as separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([name])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([name])` would concatenate the `args` array with an array containing only `name`, effectively adding `name` to the end of the `args` array. The original code passes `name` as a separate argument to `Q(object).npost()`, while the modified code passes `args` as a combined array containing `name`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1).push(name)
```
