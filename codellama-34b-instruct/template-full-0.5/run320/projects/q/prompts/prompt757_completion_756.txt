  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `allResolved` is used to wait for all promises to be settled, while `allRejected` is used to wait for all promises to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `allResolved` is used to wait for all promises to be settled, while `anyResolved` is used to wait for any promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `allResolved` is used to wait for all promises to be settled, while `allSettled` is used to wait for all promises to be either fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
