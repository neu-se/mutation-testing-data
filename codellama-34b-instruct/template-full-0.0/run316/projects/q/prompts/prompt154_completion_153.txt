  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate three strings, while this option uses the `+=` operator to concatenate the strings to the `concatedStacks` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate three strings, while this option uses the `+=` operator to concatenate the strings to the `concatedStacks` variable.
