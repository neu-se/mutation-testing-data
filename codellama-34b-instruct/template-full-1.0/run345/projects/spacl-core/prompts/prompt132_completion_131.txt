  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const associatedVerbs
```
This would result in different behavior because `associatedVerbs` is not a variable that exists in the program, so the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const associatedVerbs = []
```
This would result in different behavior because `associatedVerbs` is an empty array, but the program expects it to be an object with properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const associatedVerbs = new Map()
```
This would result in different behavior because `associatedVerbs` is a `Map` object, but the program expects it to be a plain object with properties.

DONE.
