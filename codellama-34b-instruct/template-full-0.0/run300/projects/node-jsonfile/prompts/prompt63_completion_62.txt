  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(1)` would return a new string that is a slice of the original string, starting from the second character. In contrast, `content.toString` would return the string representation of the `content` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.substr(1)` would return a new string that is a substring of the original string, starting from the second character. In contrast, `content.toString` would return the string representation of the `content` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.substring(1)` would return a new string that is a substring of the original string, starting from the second character. In contrast, `content.toString` would return the string representation of the `content` object.
