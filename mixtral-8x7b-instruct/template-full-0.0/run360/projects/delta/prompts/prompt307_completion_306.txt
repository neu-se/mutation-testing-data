 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the first insert operation's value in the line instead of the line's length itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation instead of the current operation's length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, which is not the correct length of the line.

DONE.
