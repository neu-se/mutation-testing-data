 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw rejected; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected reason would be thrown as an exception instead of being returned as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise with the `rejected` reason instead of passing it directly to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new rejected promise with the `rejected` reason using the `Promise` constructor instead of the `Q` library.

DONE.
