Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, leading to a situation where a timeout is treated as a successful completion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom timeout error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a specific error message, regardless of the original error or context, potentially obscuring the actual reason for the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Timed out");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify method instead of rejecting the promise, which is intended for progress notifications, thus not handling the timeout as an error.

DONE.
