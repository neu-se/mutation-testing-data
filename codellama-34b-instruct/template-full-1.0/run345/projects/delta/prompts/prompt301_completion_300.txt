  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to increment the line index by 1, potentially leading to incorrect line numbering in the `predicate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to use a different variable for the line index, potentially leading to confusion and errors in the `predicate` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to decrement the line index by 1, potentially leading to incorrect line numbering in the `predicate` function.

DONE.
