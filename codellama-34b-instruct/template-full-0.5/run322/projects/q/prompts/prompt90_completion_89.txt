  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `call` method, so `call.apply(f, arguments)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and cannot be called, so `call.apply(f, arguments)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function is a different type of function and would not have the same behavior as `uncurryThis`.

DONE.
