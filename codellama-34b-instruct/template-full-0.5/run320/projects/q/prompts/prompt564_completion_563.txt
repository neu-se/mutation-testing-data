  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because "throw" is a JavaScript keyword that can be used to throw an exception, whereas "reject" is a method of the Promise object that is used to reject a promise. Using "throw" instead of "reject" would cause the code to throw an exception, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because "Q.reject" is a method of the Q library that is used to reject a promise, whereas "reject" is a method of the Promise object that is used to reject a promise. Using "Q.reject" instead of "reject" would cause the code to use the Q library's reject method, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because "Promise.reject" is a method of the Promise object
