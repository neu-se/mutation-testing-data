  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` rounds the number towards zero, while `parseFloat` rounds to the nearest number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` constructor creates a number object, while `parseFloat` returns a primitive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds the number down to the nearest integer, while `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

DONE.
