  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length === 0` is always `true` when `length` is undefined, whereas `!length` is `true` when `length` is `0` or when it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length <= 0` is `true` when `length` is `0` or when it is negative, whereas `!length` is `true` when `length` is `0` or when it is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `length == null` is `true` when `length` is `0` or when it is `undefined`, whereas `!length` is `true` when `length` is `0` or when it is `undefined`.

It is important to note
