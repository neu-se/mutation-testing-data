  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this['isInfinite']()` is true, while the new code fragment returns `Complex['NAN']` in the same situation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isZero']()` is true, while the new code fragment returns `Complex['INFINITY']` in the same situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `Complex['NAN']` when `z['isZero']()` is true, while the new code fragment returns `Complex['ZERO']` in the same situation.

DONE.
