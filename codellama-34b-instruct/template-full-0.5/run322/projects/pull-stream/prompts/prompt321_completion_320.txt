  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null, data` is returned when `test(data)` is true, but `undefined` is returned when `test(data)` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null", data
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null, data` is returned when `test(data)` is true, but `"null", data` is returned when `test(data)` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null, data` is returned when `test(data)` is true, but `data, null` is returned when `test(data)` is false.

DONE.
