  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `definition` function to be called with the string "promise" as an argument, rather than the `bootstrap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"q"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `definition` function to be called with the string "q" as an argument, rather than the `bootstrap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `definition` function to be called with the string "Q" as an argument, rather than the `bootstrap` function.

DONE.
