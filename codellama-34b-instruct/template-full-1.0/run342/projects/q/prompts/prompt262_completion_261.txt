```
become(when(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the promise it is called on, while `become` sets the value directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(resolve(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value, while `become` sets the value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value, while `become` sets the value directly.

DONE.
