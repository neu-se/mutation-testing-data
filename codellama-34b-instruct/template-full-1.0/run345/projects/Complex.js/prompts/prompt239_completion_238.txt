  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of `a*2`, which is different from the original `Math.sqrt(a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b*2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of `b*2`, which is different from the original `Math.sqrt(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of `a*b`, which is different from the original `Math.sqrt(a)`.

DONE.
