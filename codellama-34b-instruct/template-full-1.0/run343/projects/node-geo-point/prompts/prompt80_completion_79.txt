  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ρtd
```
This would result in theta being calculated incorrectly because `rad2deg` is used instead of `deg2rad`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1*cosδ + cosφ1*sinδ*cosθ)
```
This would result in an incorrect calculation of `sinφ2` because `sin(`)` is missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ1*cosδ + cosφ1*sinδ*cosθ)
```
This would result in an incorrect calculation of `sinφ2` because `sin(`)` is missing.

DONE.
