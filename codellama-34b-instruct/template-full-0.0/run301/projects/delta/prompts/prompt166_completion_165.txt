  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `thisIter` iterator, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `otherIter` iterator, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `thisIter` iterator, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
