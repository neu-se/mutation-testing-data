  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` itself, while the new code fragment returns the `name` property of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` itself, while the new code fragment returns the `length` property of the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` itself, while the new code fragment returns the string representation of the `object`.

DONE.
