Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would encode the URL instead of decoding it, potentially leading to incorrect URL formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(url) { return url; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not perform any decoding or encoding on the URL, potentially preserving any existing escape sequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decode individual URL components instead of the entire URL, potentially leading to differences in how special characters are handled.

DONE.
