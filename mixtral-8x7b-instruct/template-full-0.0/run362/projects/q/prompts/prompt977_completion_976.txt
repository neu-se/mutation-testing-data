 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` creates a new deferred object and returns its promise, while `Promise.resolve` immediately returns a resolved promise. This change would bypass the actual execution of the asynchronous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Bypassing the deferred object'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of creating a deferred object. This would cause the whole promise chain to fail, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, but it might not have the same behavior as the original `defer()` function. If the `defer()` function has specific behavior or properties that are not present in the `Q.defer` function, this change could lead to
