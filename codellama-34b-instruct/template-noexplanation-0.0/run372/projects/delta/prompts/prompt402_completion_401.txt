  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to always return the second key of the `otherData` object, rather than the first key as intended. This will likely cause the method to return incorrect results, and may lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== null
```
This change will cause the `transform` method to only return the first key of the `otherData` object if it is not null. This will likely cause the method to return incorrect results, and may lead to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `transform` method
