  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would convert the word to lowercase before using it in the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would remove the first character of the word before using it in the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while this replacement would reverse the order of the characters in the word before using it in the `plural` function.

DONE.
