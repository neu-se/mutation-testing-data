  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire delta, whereas `inverted.retain` would retain only the specified attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(0)` would retain nothing, whereas `inverted.retain` would retain the specified attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(1)` would retain only the first character, whereas `inverted.retain` would retain the entire delta.

DONE.
