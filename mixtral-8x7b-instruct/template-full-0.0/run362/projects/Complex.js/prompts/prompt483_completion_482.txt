 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['im'] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra constant value to the imaginary part, which could cause the 'isInfinite' method to return incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0 && isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a non-zero real part and finite imaginary part, instead of checking for both parts being finite. This could cause the method to return incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] && isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a truthy real part and finite imaginary part, instead of checking for both parts being finite. This could cause the method to return incorrect results for certain input values, such as when the real part is zero but the method should
