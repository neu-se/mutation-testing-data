  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always set the value of the key to `null`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is `undefined` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always set the value of the key to `undefined`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is `undefined` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always set the value of the key to the current value of the key, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is `undefined` or not.

DONE.
