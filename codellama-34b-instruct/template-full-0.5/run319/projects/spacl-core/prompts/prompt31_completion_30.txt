  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be used as the replacement for the capturing group, which would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the slash character would be used as the replacement for the capturing group, which would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the double backslash character would be used as the replacement for the capturing group, which would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

DONE.
