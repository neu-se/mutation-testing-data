 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the onRejected function is replaced with an empty function, which means rejected promises would not be handled and the deferred promise would never be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because onRejected would be replaced with onFulfilled, causing the error to be swallowed and the deferred promise to be fulfilled even when a promise in the array is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because onRejected would be replaced with the this keyword, which would cause an error since onRejected expects a function as its definition.

DONE.
