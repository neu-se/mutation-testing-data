Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, leading to a successful completion of the promise chain even when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a custom error message instead of the original error, potentially altering how the error is handled downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a `null` value, which may not provide useful information about the failure, unlike the original rejection which would carry the error object.

DONE.
