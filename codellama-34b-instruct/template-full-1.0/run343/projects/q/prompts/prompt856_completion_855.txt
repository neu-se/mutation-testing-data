  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a Promise, and it will not call the `then` method on the promise, causing the promise chain to be broken.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a Promise, and it will not call the `then` method on the promise, causing the promise chain to be broken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a Promise, and it will not call the `then` method on the promise, causing the promise chain to be broken.

DONE.
