  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the lowercase version of `word`. This could cause the test to fail if the test case is expecting the original casing of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the uppercase version of `word`. This could cause the test to fail if the test case is expecting the original casing of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the substring of `word` starting from the second character. This could cause the test to fail if the test case is expecting the original word.
