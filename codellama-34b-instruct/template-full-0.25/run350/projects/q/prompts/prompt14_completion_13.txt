  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is a function that returns `false` if the argument is truthy, and `true` otherwise. In the original code, `ses.ok` is used to check if the argument is truthy, and if it is not, an error is thrown. If we replace `ses.ok` with `ses.notOk`, the error will not be thrown if the argument is falsy, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is a function that returns `false` if the argument is truthy, and `true` otherwise. In the original code, `ses.ok` is used to check if the argument is truthy, and if it is not, an error is thrown. If we replace `ses.ok` with `ses.notOk()`,
