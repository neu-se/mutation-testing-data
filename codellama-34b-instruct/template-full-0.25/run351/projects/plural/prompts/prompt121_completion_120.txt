  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new fragment changes the ending from 'ics' to 'ices'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new fragment changes the ending from 'ics' to 'es'.

DONE.
