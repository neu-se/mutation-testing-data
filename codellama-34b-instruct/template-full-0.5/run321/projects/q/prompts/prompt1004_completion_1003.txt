  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "get", which could cause the method to be called with different arguments or to be called on a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the end of the argument list, which could cause the method to be called with different arguments or to be called on a different object.

DONE.
