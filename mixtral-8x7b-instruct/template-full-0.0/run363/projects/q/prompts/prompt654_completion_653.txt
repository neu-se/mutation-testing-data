 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the receiver of the `dispatch` method to `Q(null)`, which may not have the expected `dispatch` method or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}['dispatch']
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the `dispatch` method is accessed, potentially leading to an undefined method error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `dispatch` method with a function that always returns 42, which is not the intended behavior and would cause issues in the rest of the code that relies on the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
