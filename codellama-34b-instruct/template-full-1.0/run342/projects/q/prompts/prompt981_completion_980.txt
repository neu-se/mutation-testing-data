  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and cannot be called as a function, unlike `deferred.makeNodeResolver` which is a function. This would likely result in an error being thrown when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method, unlike `deferred` which is an instance of the `Promise` class and has a `makeNodeResolver` method. This would likely result in an error being thrown when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a different value than `deferred`, and does not have a `makeNodeResolver` method. This would likely result in an error being thrown when the code is executed.

DONE.
