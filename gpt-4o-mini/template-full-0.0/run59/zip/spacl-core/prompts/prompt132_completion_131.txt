Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the verb to 'GET', meaning that only this specific verb will be cloned into the new rule, ignoring any other verbs that were previously set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(this.verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the iteration to use `Object.keys`, which may not preserve the order of verbs as they were originally defined, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the cloned rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of this.verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs` is an object, and using it directly in a `for...of` loop will throw a TypeError, as `for...of` expects an iterable, leading to a failure in the cloning process.

DONE.
