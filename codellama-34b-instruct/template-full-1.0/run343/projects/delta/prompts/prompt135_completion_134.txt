  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the first element of the iterator, which could be different from the `peek` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` property returns the second element of the iterator, which could be different from the `peek` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` property returns the third element of the iterator, which could be different from the `peek` method.

DONE.
