  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an extra 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert the word to lowercase, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first character of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

DONE.
