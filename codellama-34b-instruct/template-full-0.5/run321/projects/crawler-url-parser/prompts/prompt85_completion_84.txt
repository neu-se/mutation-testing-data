  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trimLeft();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `trim`, which removes whitespace from both the left and right sides of the string, while the new code only removes whitespace from the left side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trimRight();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `trim`, which removes whitespace from both the left and right sides of the string, while the new code only removes whitespace from the right side.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `trim`, which removes whitespace from both the left and right sides of the string, while the new code removes whitespace from both sides.

DONE.
