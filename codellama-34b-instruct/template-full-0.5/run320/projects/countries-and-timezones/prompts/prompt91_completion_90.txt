  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allTimezones` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { timezones: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timezones` option would be set to `false`, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value.

DONE.
