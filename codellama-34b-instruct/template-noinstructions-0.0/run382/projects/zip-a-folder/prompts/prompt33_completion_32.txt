  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the promise to reject with the error message "Something went wrong".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the `output` stream, which would cause the stream to end and the promise to resolve.

DONE.
