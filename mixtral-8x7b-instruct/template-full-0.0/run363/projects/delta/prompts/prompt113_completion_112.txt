 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], this.ops.reduce)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies `reduce` to each element of `this.ops` array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out `falsy` values from `this.ops` array before applying `reduce`, which could lead to different accumulated values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.reduce.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds `this` to the `reduce` function, but does not actually invoke it. This would cause the `reduce` function to not execute and return its result.

DONE.
