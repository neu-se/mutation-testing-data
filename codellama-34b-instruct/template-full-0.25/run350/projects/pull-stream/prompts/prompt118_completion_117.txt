  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is strictly equal to `false`. If `end` is a truthy value other than `false`, the original code would not return an error, while this new code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc !== data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `acc` is equal to `data`, while this new code fragment checks if `acc` is not equal to `data`. If `acc` and `data` are not equal, the original code would not return an error, while this new code would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `acc` is equal to `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `acc` is not equal to `null`. If `
