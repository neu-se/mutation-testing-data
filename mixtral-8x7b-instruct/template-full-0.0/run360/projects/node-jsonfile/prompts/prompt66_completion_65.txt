 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^\\uFEFF'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash in the regex needs to be escaped in JavaScript string literals. The original code fragment uses a regex literal, which doesn't require escaping the backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^\uFFEF'
```
This would result in different behavior because the Unicode code point for the byte order mark (BOM) is incorrect. The original code fragment uses the correct code point `\uFEFF`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^\\u{FEFF}'
```
This would result in different behavior because the Unicode code point for the BOM is represented using the Unicode escape syntax with curly braces. The original code fragment uses the traditional Unicode escape syntax without curly braces.

DONE.
