  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function is called instead of the `_fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` is modified by adding 1 to it, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
