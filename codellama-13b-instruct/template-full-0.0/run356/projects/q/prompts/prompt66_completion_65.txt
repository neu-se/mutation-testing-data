  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not attempt to create a `MessageChannel` object, which is used for communication between different JavaScript contexts. This could cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly in certain environments.

```
typeof MessageChannel !== "undefined" && MessageChannel.prototype.postMessage && typeof MessageChannel.prototype.postMessage === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only attempt to create a `MessageChannel` object if the `postMessage` method is available on the `Message
