 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `nodeArgs`, so any modifications to the original `nodeArgs` array will not affect the array used in the `dispatch` method call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array using the spread operator, which would not reflect any modifications made to the original `nodeArgs` array after this line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign([], nodeArgs)
