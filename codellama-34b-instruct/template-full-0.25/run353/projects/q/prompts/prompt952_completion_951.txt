  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object in JavaScript that contains all the arguments passed to a function, while `arguments[0]` only contains the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` would refer to the second argument passed to the function, while `arguments` would refer to all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length` would refer to the number of arguments passed to the function, while `arguments` would refer to all the arguments.

DONE.
