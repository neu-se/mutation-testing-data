  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method uses the delimiter to separate the elements in the array. Using "\t" instead of "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" would produce a different string, which would result in a different stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method uses the delimiter to separate the elements in the array. Using " " instead of "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" would produce a different string, which would result in a different stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\v"
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method uses the delimiter to separate the elements in the array. Using "\v" instead of "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" would produce a different string, which
