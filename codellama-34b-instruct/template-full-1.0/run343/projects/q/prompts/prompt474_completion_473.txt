  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the array index would now be negative, which is not valid and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would no longer be thrown, and the array index would remain unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would no longer be thrown, and the array index would remain unchanged.

DONE.
