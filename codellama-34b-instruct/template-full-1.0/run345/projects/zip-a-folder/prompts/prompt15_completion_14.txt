  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` checks if the file is writable, while `fs.constants.R_OK` checks if the file is readable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK, src
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the `access()` method is important. `fs.constants.R_OK` should be the first argument, as it sets the access mode to read-only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for read access to the file path, but it would also return `true` if the file does not exist.

DONE.
