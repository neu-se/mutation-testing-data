 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => getCountry(options, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the `id` and `options` arguments when calling `getCountry`, potentially causing incorrect country initialization or data retrieval.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => getTimezone(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `getTimezone` instead of `getCountry`, which would return timezone data instead of country data, causing incorrect results for the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => ({ id })
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a simple object with an `id` property instead of the actual country data, causing incorrect results for the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

DONE.
