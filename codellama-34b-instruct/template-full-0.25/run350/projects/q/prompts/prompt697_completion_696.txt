  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array with the elements `1`, `2`, and `3`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
