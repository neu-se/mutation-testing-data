  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { foo: 'bar' }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would now pass a non-empty object as the second argument to the `predicate` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would now pass a different value for the `index` argument to the `predicate` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { foo: 'bar' }, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would now pass a non-empty object as the second argument to the `predicate` function, and a different value for the `index` argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
