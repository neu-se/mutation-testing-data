  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a reference to the variable `object`, while `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a reference to any variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a reference to the variable `object`, while `null` is a primitive value that is not a reference to any variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"replace me"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a reference to the variable `object`, while `"replace me"` is a string that is not a reference to any variable.

DONE.
