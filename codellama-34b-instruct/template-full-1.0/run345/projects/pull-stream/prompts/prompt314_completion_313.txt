  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `test` function to always return `true`, even if the original function was designed to return `false` for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to always return `null`, even if the original function was designed to return a non-null value for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to always return `undefined`, even if the original function was designed to return a non-undefined value for certain inputs.

DONE.
