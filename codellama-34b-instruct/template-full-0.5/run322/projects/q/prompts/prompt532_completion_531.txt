  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `all()` returns a promise for an array of values, while `spread()` returns a promise for the return value of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` returns a promise for the return value of the callback, while `spread()` returns a promise for the return value of the callback called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch()` returns a promise for the return value of the callback, while `spread()` returns a promise for the return value of the callback called with the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
