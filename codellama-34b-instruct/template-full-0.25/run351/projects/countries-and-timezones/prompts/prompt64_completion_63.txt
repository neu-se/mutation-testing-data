  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverTimezones` is a function that returns a filtered list of timezones based on the `deprecated` option, while `deliverCountry` is a function that returns a country object with its timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesForCountry` is a function that returns a list of timezones for a given country, while `deliverCountry` is a function that returns a country object with its timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountryForTimezone` is a function that returns a country object for a given timezone, while `deliverCountry` is a function that returns a country object with its timezones.

DONE.
