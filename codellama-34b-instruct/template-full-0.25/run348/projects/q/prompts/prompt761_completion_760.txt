  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first promise in the array, which could cause the `allResolved` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra rejected promise to the end of the array, which would cause the `allResolved` method to return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.map(function (promise) {
    return Q.reject(promise);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would map each promise in the array to a rejected promise, which would cause the `allResolved` method to return a rejected promise.

DONE.
