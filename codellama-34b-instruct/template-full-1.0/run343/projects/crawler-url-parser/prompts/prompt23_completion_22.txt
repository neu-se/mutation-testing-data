  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substr(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring function would remove the first character of the string, which could cause the URL parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.indexOf('/') + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf function would find the first occurrence of the '/' character and return the index, which could cause the URL parsing to start at the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http', 'ftp');
```
This would result in different behavior because the replace function would replace the 'http' string with 'ftp', which would cause the URL parsing to fail.

DONE.
