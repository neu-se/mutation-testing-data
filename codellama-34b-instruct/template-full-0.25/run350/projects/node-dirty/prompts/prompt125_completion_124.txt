  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while this modified code emits the event with the argument 'foo'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while this modified code emits the event with the argument `this._writeStream`, which is a file stream object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event without any arguments, while this modified code emits the event with the argument `this._data.size`, which is the size of the data object.

DONE.
