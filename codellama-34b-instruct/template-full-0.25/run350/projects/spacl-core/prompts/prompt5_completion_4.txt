  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that searches for a match in a string, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether a specified value is present in a string, whereas `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

DONE.
