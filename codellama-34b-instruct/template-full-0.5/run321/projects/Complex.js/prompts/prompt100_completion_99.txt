  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added '1' would cause the string concatenation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the variable c would cause the calculation of the complex number to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of c by 2 would cause the calculation of the complex number to produce a different result.

DONE.
