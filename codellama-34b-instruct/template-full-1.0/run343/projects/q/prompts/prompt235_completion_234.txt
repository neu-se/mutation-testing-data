  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is the first argument passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, whereas `args` is an array of all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[1]` is the second operand passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, whereas `args` is an array of all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners[0]` is the first element of the `progressListeners` array, whereas `args` is an array of all the arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` function.

DONE.
