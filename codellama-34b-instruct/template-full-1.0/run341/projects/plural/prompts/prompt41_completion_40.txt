  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in the function returning the wrong substring starting at the second-to-last character, rather than the third-to-last character, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in the function returning the wrong substring starting at the third-to-last character, rather than the second-to-last character, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(w.length - 3)
```
This would result in the function returning the third-to-last character, rather than the second-to-last character, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
