  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse function of `deg2rad`, so the resulting bearing would be in degrees instead of radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI / 180` is a constant that represents the number of radians in a degree, so the resulting bearing would be in radians instead of degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, so the resulting bearing would be different from the original calculation.

DONE.
