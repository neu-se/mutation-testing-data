  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is used for handling fulfilled promises, not rejected ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function is called with a non-null value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_progressed` function is used for handling progress notifications, not rejected promises.

DONE.
