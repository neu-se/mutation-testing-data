  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be setting the value of the key to one less than the provided value, rather than the provided value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be setting the value of the key to twice the provided value, rather than the provided value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val % 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would be setting the value of the key to the remainder of the provided value divided by 2, rather than the provided value itself.

DONE.
