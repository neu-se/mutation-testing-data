  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the second-to-last operation in the delta, rather than the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the first operation in the delta, rather than the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * delta.ops.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a random operation in the delta, rather than the last operation.

DONE.
