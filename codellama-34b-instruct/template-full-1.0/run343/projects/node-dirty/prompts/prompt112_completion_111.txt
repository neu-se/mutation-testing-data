  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the beginning of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would report a different message when an error occurs at the end of the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer} and some other data`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append some other data to the error message, which would change the behavior of the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not provide any information about the error that occurred, which could make it more difficult to debug the issue.

DONE.
