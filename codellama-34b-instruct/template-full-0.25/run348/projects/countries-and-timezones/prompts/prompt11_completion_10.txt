  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the new object with the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = Object.assign({}, result[country], { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the new object with the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = Object.assign({}, result[country], { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the new object with the existing one.

DONE.
