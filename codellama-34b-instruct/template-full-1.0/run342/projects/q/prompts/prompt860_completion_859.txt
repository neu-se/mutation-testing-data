  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code fragment 1!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rethrows the `exception` which is useful for debugging, but the new code fragment will throw a different error message which may cause confusion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rethrows the `exception` which may be useful for debugging, but the new code fragment will throw an unrelated integer value which may cause confusion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
  throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a dangling `then` which is never used, but the new code fragment uses the `then` method to append a new callback function which will also be called when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
