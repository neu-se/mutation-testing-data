  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `coordinates` property of the `point` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `coordinates` property of the `point.coordinates` object. This could cause the code to throw a different error or behave differently in other ways.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `type` property of the `point` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `type` property of the `point.type` object. This could cause the code to throw a different error or behave differently in other ways.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the first element of the `coordinates` array, while the new code fragment is accessing the first element of the `point.
