  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the key to be incremented by 1, which could result in a different value being stored in the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the key to be decremented by 1, which could result in a different value being stored in the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the key to be multiplied by 2, which could result in a different value being stored in the cache.

DONE.
