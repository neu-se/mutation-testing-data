  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the attribute value is not null, but this new code fragment would only allow attributes with a value of null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof attributes[key] === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the attribute value is not null, but this new code fragment would only allow attributes with a value of undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the attribute value is not null, but this new code fragment would always return false, allowing all attributes regardless of their value.

DONE.
