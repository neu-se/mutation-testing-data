  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2).attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the line and return the attributes of the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object instead of the attributes of the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes || { foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with a `foo` property set to `'bar'` instead of the attributes of the first character.

DONE.
