 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = lines.length - 1; i >= 0; --i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, which could cause issues if the order of processing is important or if the loop relies on some state that changes during iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = 1; i < lines.length; ++i
