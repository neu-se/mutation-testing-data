  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` in the calculation, while the replacement code fragment uses the value of `y`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the program's output. DONE.
