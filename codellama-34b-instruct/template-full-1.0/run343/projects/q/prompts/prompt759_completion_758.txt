  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a different function than `allResolved`, `allSettled`, and `any`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved.bind(null)` is a different function than `allResolved`, `allSettled`, and `any`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` is a different function than `allResolved`, `allSettled`, and `any`.

DONE.
