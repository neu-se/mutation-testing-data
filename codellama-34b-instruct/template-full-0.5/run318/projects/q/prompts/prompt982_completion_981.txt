  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which is then passed to the `this.dispatch()` method. However, the new code fragment does not push the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which means that it will not be passed to the `this.dispatch()` method. This could cause the `this.dispatch()` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which is then passed to the `this.dispatch()` method. However, the new code fragment pushes the `deferred.reject` function onto the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the
