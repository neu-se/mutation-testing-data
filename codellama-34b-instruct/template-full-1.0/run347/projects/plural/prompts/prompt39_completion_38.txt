  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'osis' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected output from `ices` to `osis`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'uses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected output from `ices` to `uses`, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it keeps the expected output as `ices`, but the test would fail because the function is not returning the expected output.

DONE.
