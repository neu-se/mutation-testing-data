  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second character of the `part` string instead of the slice from the second character onwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of `part` starting from the second character instead of the slice from the second character onwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of `part` starting from the second character instead of the slice from the second character onwards.

DONE.
