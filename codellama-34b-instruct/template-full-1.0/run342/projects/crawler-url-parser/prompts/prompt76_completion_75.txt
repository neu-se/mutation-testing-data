  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.parse(embedBaseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called on the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrl.parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called on the wrong object.

DONE.
