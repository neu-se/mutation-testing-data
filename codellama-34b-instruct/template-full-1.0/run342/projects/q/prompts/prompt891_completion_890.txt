  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (args.length) {
    args.pop();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would empty the `args` array, potentially causing bugs in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof args.pop() !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the last item of the `args` array is not `undefined`, potentially causing bugs in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the code, potentially causing bugs in the surrounding code.

DONE.
