  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the longitude value would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the latitude value would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2, x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to the latitude and longitude values would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
