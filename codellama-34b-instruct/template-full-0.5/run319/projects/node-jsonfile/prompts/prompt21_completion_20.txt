  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would be called with `null` as the second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, "invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` function would be called with `"invalid"` as the second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
