  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is an array, while replacing it with `null` would cause the `Array.isArray()` method to return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is an array, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `Array.isArray()` method to return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is an array, while replacing it with an empty array would cause the `Array.isArray()` method to return `true`.

DONE.
