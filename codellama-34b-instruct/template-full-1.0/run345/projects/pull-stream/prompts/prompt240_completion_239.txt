  Here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `end`, which means that the callback function will be called with the `end` argument set to `true`. By replacing it with `true`, the callback function will be called with the `end` argument set to `true` all the time, which could cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `end`, which means that the callback function will be called with the `end` argument set to `true` only when the end of the stream is reached. By replacing it with `false`, the callback function will never be called with the `end` argument set to `true`, which could cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result
