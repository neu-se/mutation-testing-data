 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the literal string `\n` instead of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\n/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the literal string `\n` instead of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\n\r]/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace both newline (`\n`) and carriage return (`\r`) characters with the value of `EOL`, which could lead to unexpected results if the input string contains carriage returns.

DONE.
