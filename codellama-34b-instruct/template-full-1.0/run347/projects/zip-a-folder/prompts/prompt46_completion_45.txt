  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return true, even if the folder is not found, which could cause bugs or incorrect assumptions in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"false"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a string, even if the folder is found, which could cause bugs or incorrect assumptions in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return undefined, even if the folder is found, which could cause bugs or incorrect assumptions in the rest of the code.

DONE.
