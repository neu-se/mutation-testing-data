  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by all elements of the array returned by `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` would return the number of elements in `args`, whereas `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by all elements of the array returned by `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` would remove and return the last element of `args`, whereas `concat` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by all elements of the array returned by `array_slice
