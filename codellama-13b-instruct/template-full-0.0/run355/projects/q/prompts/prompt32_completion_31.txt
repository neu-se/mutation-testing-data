  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `runSingle(task, domain);` is not executed, and the `task` function is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `runSingle(task, domain);` is not executed, and the `task` function is not called with the `domain` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, domain, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `runSingle(task, domain);` is not executed, and the `task` function is not called with the `domain` argument, and the `true` argument is passed to the `runSingle` function.

DONE.
