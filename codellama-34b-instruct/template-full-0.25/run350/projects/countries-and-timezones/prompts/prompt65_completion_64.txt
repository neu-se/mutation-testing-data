  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country object to null, causing the `getCountry` function to return null, even if the country exists in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country object to an empty object, causing the `getCountry` function to return an empty object, even if the country exists in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = { id: id };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the country object to an object with the same id as the country, causing the `getCountry` function to return an object with the same id, even if the country exists in the `countries` object.

DONE.
