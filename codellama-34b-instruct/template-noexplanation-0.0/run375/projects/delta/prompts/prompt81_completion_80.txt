  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This change will cause the `push` method to be called on the `ops` array instead of the `unshift` method, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp)
```
This change will cause the `splice` method to be called on the `ops` array with the `newOp` object as the first argument, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat(newOp)
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to be called on the `ops` array with the `newOp` object as the argument, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
