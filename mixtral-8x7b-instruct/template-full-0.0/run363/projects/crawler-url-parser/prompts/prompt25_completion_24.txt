 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
baseUrlStr.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character from the base URL string, which could lead to incorrect URL parsing if the last character is a trailing slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the fragment part of the base URL with a question mark, which could lead to incorrect URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the fragment part of the base URL with a random number, which could lead to unpredictable URL parsing results.

DONE.
