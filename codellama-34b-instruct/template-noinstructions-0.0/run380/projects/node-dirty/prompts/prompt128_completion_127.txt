  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that unblocks the stream, allowing data to flow through it, while `cork` is a method that blocks the stream, preventing data from flowing through it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a method that signals the end of the stream, while `cork` is a method that blocks the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that destroys the stream, while `cork` is a method that blocks the stream.

DONE.
