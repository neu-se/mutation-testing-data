  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb === null` is a different condition than `!cb`, which checks if `cb` is truthy or falsy. If `cb` is `null`, the original code would call the callback with an error, but the mutated code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof cb !== 'function'` is a different condition than `!cb`, which checks if `cb` is truthy or falsy. If `cb` is not a function, the original code would call the callback with an error, but the mutated code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.length === 0` is a different condition than `!cb`, which checks if `cb` is truthy or falsy. If `
