  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[4]` instead of `ref[3]`, which would cause the function to behave differently when the length of the `arguments` object is greater than 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[3] + 1` instead of `ref[3]`, which would cause the function to behave differently when the length of the `arguments` object is greater than 3.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[3] - 1` instead
