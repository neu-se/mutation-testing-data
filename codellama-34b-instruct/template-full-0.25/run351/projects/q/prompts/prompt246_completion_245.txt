  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set even if `Q.longStackSupport` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the condition always true, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set regardless of the value of `Q.longStackSupport`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the condition always false, causing the `promise.stack` property to never be set.

DONE.
