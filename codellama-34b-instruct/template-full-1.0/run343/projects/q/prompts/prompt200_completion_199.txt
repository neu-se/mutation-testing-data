  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the original array, while the `split` method returns an array of strings split at the provided separator. If the goal is to modify the original array, `slice` is not the appropriate method to use.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method modifies the original array by removing or replacing existing elements, while the `split` method returns an array of strings split at the provided separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that match the provided filter function, while the `split` method returns an array of strings split at the provided separator.

DONE.
