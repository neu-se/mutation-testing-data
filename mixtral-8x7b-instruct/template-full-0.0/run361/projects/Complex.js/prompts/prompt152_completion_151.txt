 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of z is equal to Infinity, instead of checking if z is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is infinite, instead of checking if the input complex number z is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns true, regardless of the input complex number z.

DONE.
