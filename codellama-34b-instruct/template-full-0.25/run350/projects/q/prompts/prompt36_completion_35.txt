  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the condition, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the `process` variable, which is not an object in the browser environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() !== "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `process` object, which is not the same as the string "[object process]" in the browser environment.

DONE.
