  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the callback would not be called, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment, where `cb` is a function and would be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that indicates the absence of a callback function, so it would cause the `set` method to skip the callback invocation, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment, where `cb` is a non-null function and would be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new callback function that would be called instead of the original `cb` function. This would cause a different execution path of the code and potentially introduce new bugs or errors.

DONE.
