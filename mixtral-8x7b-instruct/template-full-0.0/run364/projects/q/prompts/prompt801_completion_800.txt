 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method treats `null` and `undefined` differently. In the original code, passing `undefined` as an argument to `then` would result in no progress handler being set, whereas passing `null` would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be used as the progress handler, which would not provide the same behavior as no progress handler. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
