  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `-a` would return the negative value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `a + 1` would return the value of `a` plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `a * 2` would return the value of `a` multiplied by 2.

DONE.
