  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except for the first one, whereas the original code fragment `arguments` would return an array containing all arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except for the first two, whereas the original code fragment `arguments` would return an array containing all arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` except for the first three, whereas the original code fragment `arguments` would return an array containing all arguments passed to the function
