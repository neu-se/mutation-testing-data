 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error as an error message instead of emitting an 'unhandledRejection' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not do anything, and the unhandled rejection would not be tracked or reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the handling of the unhandled rejection to be run in the next tick of the event loop, instead of emitting an 'unhandledRejection' event immediately.

DONE.
