  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if both are infinite. This would cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed only if both `this` and `z` are infinite, which is a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if both are infinite. This would cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed only if both `this` and `z` are infinite, which is a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !
