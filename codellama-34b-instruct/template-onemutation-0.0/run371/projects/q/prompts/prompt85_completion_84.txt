  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that takes no arguments, but `flush` is a function that takes one argument. By passing `flush` as an argument to `requestTick`, we are effectively calling `flush` with no arguments, which would cause it to fail.

DONE.
