Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array containing only the next operation instead of concatenating it with the rest of the operations, potentially losing the remaining operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current operation and return all subsequent operations, which changes the expected output of the `rest` method by omitting the operation at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remaining operations in reverse order, altering the sequence of operations that the iterator would provide, which could lead to unexpected results in processing.

DONE.
