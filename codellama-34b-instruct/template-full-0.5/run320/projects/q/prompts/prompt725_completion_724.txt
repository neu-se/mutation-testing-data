  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's current state, while `promise.inspect.value` returns the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect.state` returns the state of the promise ("fulfilled" or "rejected"), while `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's current state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect.reason` returns the reason for the promise's rejection, while `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's current state.

DONE.
