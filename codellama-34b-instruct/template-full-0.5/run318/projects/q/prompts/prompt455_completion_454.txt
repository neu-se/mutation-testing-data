  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called, which would remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, even if it has not been handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections && unhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `untrackRejection` function if `trackUnhandledRejections` is false and there are unhandled rejections in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `untrackRejection` function if the `process` object is defined and it has an `emit` function, which is not always the case.

DONE.
