  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
