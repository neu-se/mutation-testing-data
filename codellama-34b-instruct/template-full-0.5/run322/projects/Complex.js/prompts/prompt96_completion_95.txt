  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the program to exit with a non-zero status code, indicating an error, even if the input string is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the program to exit with a zero status code, indicating success, even if the input string is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose whether to exit with an error or success status code, making it difficult to predict the program's behavior.

DONE.
