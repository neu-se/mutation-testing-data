  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the double negation operator `!!` will coerce the value of `cb` to a boolean, which will always be `true` if `cb` is a function. In the original code, `!cb` would only be `true` if `cb` is a function that returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && !!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will only evaluate the second operand (`!!test`) if the first operand (`cb`) is truthy. In the original code, the `&&` operator was used to short-circuit evaluation if `cb` was falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, while the `!=` operator checks for non-strict equality. In the original code, the
