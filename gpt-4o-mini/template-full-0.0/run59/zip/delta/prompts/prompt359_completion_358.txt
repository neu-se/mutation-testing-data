Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected input type from a Delta or number to a number that is incremented by 1, potentially leading to incorrect index calculations and unexpected results in the transformation logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the input by multiplying it by 2, which could cause the transformation to skip over certain operations or incorrectly calculate positions, leading to unexpected behavior in the resulting Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the input to a string, which would not be compatible with the expected number or Delta type, likely causing runtime errors or incorrect processing of the transformation logic.

DONE.
