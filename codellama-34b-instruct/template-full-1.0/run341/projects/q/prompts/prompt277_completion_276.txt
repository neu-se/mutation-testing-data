  Sure! Here are my three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0].length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the first argument, rather than the number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0] > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first argument to the number 2, rather than checking the number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the number of arguments is greater than or equal to 2, rather than checking if the number of arguments is greater than 2.

DONE.
