  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called only if the `busy` flag is set to `true` and `abortCb` is not null. In the original code, the `abortCb` function is called regardless of the value of the `busy` flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called only if it is not null, regardless of the value of the `busy` flag. In the original code, the `abortCb` function is called regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abortCb` function to be called regardless of the value of the `busy` flag and the value of
