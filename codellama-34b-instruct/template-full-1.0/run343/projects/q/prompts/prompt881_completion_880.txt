  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `deferred.reject(error)`, which passes the `error` object to the rejection handler, while the modified code calls `deferred.reject(exception)`, which passes the `exception` object to the rejection handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `deferred.reject(error)`, which rejects the promise with the `error` object, while the modified code calls `Q.reject(exception)`, which rejects the promise with the `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `deferred.reject(error)`, which rejects the promise with the `error` object, while the modified code calls `deferred.reject()`,
