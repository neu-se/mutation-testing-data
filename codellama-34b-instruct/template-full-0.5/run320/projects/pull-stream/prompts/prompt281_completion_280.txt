  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper + 1` would return a different value than `mapper`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper * 2` would return a different value than `mapper`, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because `!mapper` would return a different value than `mapper`, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
