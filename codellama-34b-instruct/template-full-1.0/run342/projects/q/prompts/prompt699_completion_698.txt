  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second element, instead of the first, which would produce a different outcome in the `fbound` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression evaluates to `undefined`, which would cause the `fbound` function to return an `undefined` value, instead of the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced starting from the second element, instead of the first, which would produce a different outcome in the `fbound` function.

DONE.
