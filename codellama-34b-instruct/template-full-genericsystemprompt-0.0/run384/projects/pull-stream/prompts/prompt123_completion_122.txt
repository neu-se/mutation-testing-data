  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not incremented in the original code, but it is incremented in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is not decremented in the original code, but it is decremented in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is not incremented in the original code, but it is incremented in the mutated code.

DONE.
