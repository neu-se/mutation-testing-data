  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the queue is not empty and the stream is not waiting for a drain, but this code fragment would call `_flush` regardless of the state of the queue and stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` with no arguments, but this code fragment would call `_flush` with the argument `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` with no arguments, but this code fragment would call `_flush` with the argument `false`.

DONE.
