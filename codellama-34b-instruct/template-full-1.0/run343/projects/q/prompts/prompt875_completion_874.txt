  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(deferred, nodeArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `deferred` object, which is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(this, deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `this` object, which is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(null, deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `apply` method on the `null` object, which is not a function and would throw an error.

DONE.
