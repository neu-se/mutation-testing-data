  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second element of the `component` array instead of the first element, which is the type of the component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the length of the first element of the `component` array instead of the first element itself, which is the type of the component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[0].type
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the type of the first element of the `component` array instead of the first element itself, which is the type of the component.

DONE.
