  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
