  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the result of the `_fulfilled` function, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the result of the `_rejected` function, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to always return the result of the `_fulfilled` function, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
