  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstLeft - firstOther.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the iteration by skipping over some elements in the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iterator.next(1 + length - firstLeft);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the iteration by advancing by one more element than necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peek().retain, otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different way of calculating the length of the iteration.

DONE.
