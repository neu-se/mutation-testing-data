  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the object, but the mutated code would return null, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the object, but the mutated code would return undefined, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the object, but the mutated code would return an empty object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the program.

DONE.
