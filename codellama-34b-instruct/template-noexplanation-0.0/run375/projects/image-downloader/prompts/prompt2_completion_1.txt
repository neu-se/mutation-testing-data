  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This will cause the function to always return a resolved promise, even if the `options.url` or `options.dest` are not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Invalid options'))
```
This will cause the function to always return a rejected promise, regardless of the input options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(options.url)
```
This will cause the function to always return a resolved promise with the `options.url` as the resolved value, regardless of the input options.

DONE.
