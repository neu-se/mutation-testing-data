Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown', options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to get a country with the ID 'unknown', which likely does not exist in the data, leading to a null return instead of the expected country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id.toUpperCase(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the country ID to uppercase, potentially causing a mismatch with the keys in the `data.countries` object, resulting in a failure to retrieve the correct country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id, { ...options, deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the options to always include `deprecated: true`, which could change the behavior of how countries are delivered, potentially filtering out certain timezones that are not deprecated.

DONE.
