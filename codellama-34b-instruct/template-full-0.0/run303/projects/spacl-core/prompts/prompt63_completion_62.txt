  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` was using the `reverse()` method with an argument, which is not a valid usage of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the specified number of elements from the original array, whereas the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` was using the `reverse()` method with an argument, which is not a valid usage of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array and returns it, whereas the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>
