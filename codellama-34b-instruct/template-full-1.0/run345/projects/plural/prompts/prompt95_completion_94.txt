  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^Wo?Man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator makes the `o` optional, so it would match "woman" and "woMan", which would otherwise not be matched by the original regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^Wo(?:Man|Woman)$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator makes the entire group optional, so it would match "woman" and "woMan", but also "wo", which would not be matched by the original regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:Wo|Man)$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator makes the entire group optional, so it would match "woman" and "woMan", but also "wo", "man", and "woMan" (which would not be matched by the original regex).

DONE.
