  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions ? zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas the original code would only return `null` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `null` or `undefined` and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is also `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions ? zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas the original code would only return `undefined` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `null` or `undefined` and `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is also `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.custom
