  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would be assigned a value of `undefined`, which would cause the function to execute the `reject` branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only execute the `reject` branch if `timeout` is greater than 0, whereas the original code would execute the `reject` branch for any non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` would be converted to a boolean value, and the function would only execute the `reject` branch if `timeout` is falsy (i.e., if it is `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, etc.).

DONE.
