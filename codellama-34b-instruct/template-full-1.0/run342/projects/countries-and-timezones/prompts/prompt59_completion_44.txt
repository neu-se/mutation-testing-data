  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id.split('-')[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split('-')[0]` method call on the `id` variable would cause the country lookup to be performed on the first part of the `id` string, rather than the whole string. This could cause the `getCountry()` function to return a different country than expected, or even throw an error if the split string is not a valid country ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method call on the `id` variable would cause the country lookup to be performed on the string without the first character, effectively skipping the first character of the `id` string. This could cause the `getCountry()` function to return a different country than expected, or even throw an error if the sliced string is not a valid country ID.
