  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).spread(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` method to be called on the `Q` object, which would then call the `spread` method on the `Promise` object, which would then call the `all` method on the `Promise` object, which would then call the `then` method on the `Promise` object, which would then call the `apply` method on the `Promise` object, which would then call the `inspect` method on the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.spread(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` method to be called on the `value` object, which would then call the `all` method on the `Prom
