  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function (){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the function, even if cb is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function (){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the function if cb is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb ? function (){} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the function if cb is not undefined, and it would return null if cb is undefined.

DONE.
