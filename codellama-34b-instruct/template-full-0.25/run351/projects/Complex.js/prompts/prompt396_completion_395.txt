  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the value, which can affect the calculation of the complex number's real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the value of `b` changes the calculation of the complex number's real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `b` by 2 changes the calculation of the complex number's real and imaginary parts.

DONE.
