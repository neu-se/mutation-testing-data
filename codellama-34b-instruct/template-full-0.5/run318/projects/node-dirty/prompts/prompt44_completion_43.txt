  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key)), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is applied to the value returned by `this.get(key)`, which may not be the same as the value that was originally set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(val), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is applied to the value `val`, which may not be the same as the value that was originally set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, updater(this.get(key).toString()), cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is called on the value returned by `this.get(key)`, which may not be the same as the value that was originally set.

DONE.
