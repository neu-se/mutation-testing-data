  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations and potentially produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the squaring operation on `a`.

DONE.
