  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `index > 0`, which means it will skip the first character of the string if it is an empty string or a single character. However, if we replace `index > 0` with `index < 1`, it will instead skip the first character only if `index` is less than 1, which means it will always skip the first character, regardless of whether the string is empty or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `index > 0`, which means it will skip the first character of the string if it is an empty string or a single character. However, if we replace `index > 0` with `length === 0`, it will instead skip the first character only if the length of the string is 0, which means it will always skip the first character if the string is empty, regardless of whether `index` is greater than
