  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `.call` is a method of the `Function` object in JavaScript, while `array_slice` is a method of the `Array` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a method of the `Array` object, while `array_slice` is a method of the `array_slice` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is a method of the `Array` object, while `array_slice` is a method of the `array_slice` object.

DONE.
