  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with the `data` argument, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with the `this` context, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.apply(this, [data])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with the `this` context and an array of arguments, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
