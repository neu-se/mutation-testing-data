  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` will create a new function with the `this` value bound to `object`, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` will call the `dispatch` method with `object` as the `this` value, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` will call the `dispatch` method with `object` as the `this` value and an empty arguments list, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
