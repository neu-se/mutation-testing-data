  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that slices an array, but `arguments` is not an array, so it would return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce.call(arguments, function(a, b) { return a + b; }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a function that reduces an array to a single value, but `arguments` is not an array, so it would return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map.call(arguments, function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a function that maps an array to a new array, but `arguments` is not an array, so it would return an empty array.

DONE.
