  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is called with the `exception` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The `rejected` function should be called with the `exception` argument to properly handle the rejection of the promise.
