  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation is not commutative, meaning that the result would be different if the operands were reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation would change the result of the expression, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operation would change the result of the expression, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
