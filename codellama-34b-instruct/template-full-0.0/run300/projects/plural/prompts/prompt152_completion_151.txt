  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `num` as is, while this replacement would increment the value of `num` by 1 before using it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `num` as is, while this replacement would multiply the value of `num` by 2 before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `num` as is, while this replacement would decrement the value of `num` by 1 before using it.

DONE.
