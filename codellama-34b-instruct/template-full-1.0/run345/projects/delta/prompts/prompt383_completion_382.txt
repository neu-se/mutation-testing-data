  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest number among the given arguments, while `Math.max` returns the largest number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b) => a + b - Math.min(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would subtract the smaller of the two arguments from the sum of the two arguments, rather than the larger.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b) => a + b - Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would subtract the larger of the two arguments from the sum of the two arguments, rather than the smaller.

DONE.
