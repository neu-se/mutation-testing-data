  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` property is undefined, whereas the original code fragment would check if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.url !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` property is not a string, whereas the original code fragment would check if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.url` property is an empty string, whereas the original code fragment would check if it is falsy.

DONE.
