  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*/)[^\]]+$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression that would match a different pattern in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]\{2,}$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression that matches two or more slashes at the end of the input string.

DONE.
