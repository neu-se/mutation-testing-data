  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that can be called with the `this` keyword bound to the first argument. By passing `Array.prototype.slice` to `uncurryThis`, we are creating a new function that can be called with the `this` keyword bound to an array, which is not the intended behavior of `Array.prototype.slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice.call(null)` would return an empty array, whereas `uncurryThis` would return a function that can be called with the `this` keyword bound to an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior
