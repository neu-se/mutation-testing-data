  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this['re']` and `this['im']` to calculate the complex number, while `1 - this['im']` would calculate a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this['re']` and `this['im']` to calculate the complex number, while `2 * this['im']` would calculate a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this['re']` and `this['im']` to calculate the complex number, while `this['re'] * this['im']` would calculate a different complex number.

DONE.
