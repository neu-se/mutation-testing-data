  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--------------------------
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Op.length` to get the length of the op, but the replaced code uses `---` which is a different operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
alert(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not have any alert statements, but the replaced code has an alert statement that will pop up a dialog box when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use undefined anywhere, but the replaced code uses undefined, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior if the rest of the code is not designed to handle undefined values.

DONE.
