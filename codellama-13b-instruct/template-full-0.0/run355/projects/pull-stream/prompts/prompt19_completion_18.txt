  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the third element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the fourth element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

DONE.
