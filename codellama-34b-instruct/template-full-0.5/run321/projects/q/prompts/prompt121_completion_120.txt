  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the property `1` instead of the property names of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "key";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the property `"key"` instead of the property names of the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object.key;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the value of the `key` property of the `object` instead of the property names of the `object`.

DONE.
