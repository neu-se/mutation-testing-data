Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the input word to uppercase, which would cause the regex rules to fail to match if they are case-sensitive, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the function to always return the plural form by appending 's' to the word, bypassing any rules defined in the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `rules[i][0]` regex directly on the `word` variable instead of the intended `word` variable, which could lead to unexpected results if the regex is not designed to match the word directly.

DONE.
