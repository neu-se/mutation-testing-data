  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` check would always return `false`, even if the `plural` function has not been defined on the `String` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` check would always return `true`, even if the `plural` function has been defined on the `String` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function check would always return `false`, even if the `plural` function has been defined on the `String` prototype.

DONE.
