  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the key as is, while this replacement would convert the key to uppercase, which could result in a different key being used for the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the key as is, while this replacement would append the string 'foo' to the key, which could result in a different key being used for the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the key as is, while this replacement would use the string 'foo' as the key for the map, regardless of the original key.

DONE.
