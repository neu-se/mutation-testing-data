  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the property values of an object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs for an object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.form
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.form` is not a valid JavaScript method.

DONE.
