  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `text.includes(text)` would cause the code to only update the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object if the `text` property already contains the new text. This would prevent the code from updating the `text` property with duplicate text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text !== text
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `text !== text` would cause the code to only update the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object if the `text` property is not already equal to the new text. This would prevent the code from updating the `text` property with duplicate text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.
