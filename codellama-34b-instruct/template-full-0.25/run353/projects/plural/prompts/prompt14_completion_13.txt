  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to retrieve the first character of a string, while `1` would retrieve the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to retrieve the first character of a string, while `-1` would retrieve the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` is used to retrieve the first character of a string, while `word.length - 1` would retrieve the last character.

DONE.
