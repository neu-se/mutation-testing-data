  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_error` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, but it is emitted when there is an error during the write process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_drain` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, but it is emitted when the write stream is drained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_end` event is not emitted when the write stream is closed, but it is emitted when the write stream is ended.

DONE.
