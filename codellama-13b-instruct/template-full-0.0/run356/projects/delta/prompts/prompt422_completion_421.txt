  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - offset` expression would be replaced with `index + offset`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 2 * offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - offset` expression would be replaced with `index - 2 * offset`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 2 * offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - offset` expression would be replaced with `index + 2 * offset`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to return a different value.

DONE.
