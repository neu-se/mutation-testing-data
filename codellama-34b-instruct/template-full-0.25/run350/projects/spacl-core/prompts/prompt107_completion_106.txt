  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "foo" to the end of the path, which may not be intended and could cause the policy to be applied incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the path to uppercase, which could cause the policy to be applied incorrectly if the path is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the path, which may not be intended and could cause the policy to be applied incorrectly.

DONE.
