  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` will always return the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment `2` will always return the second element of the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` will always return the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment `nodeArgs.length` will always return the length of the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `1` will always return the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment `args.length` will always return the length of the `args` array.

DONE.
