  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
boolean(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment ensures that `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object, while this code fragment only checks if `thisOp.retain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
typeof thisOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number or an object, while this code fragment only checks if it's a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number or an object, while this code fragment only checks if `otherOp.delete` is a number.
