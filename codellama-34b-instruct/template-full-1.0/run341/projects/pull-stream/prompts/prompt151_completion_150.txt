  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a callback function that takes two arguments, but `abortCb` is a callback function that takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is a local variable that is assigned to `null`, but `_value` is an undefined variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `abort`, and `cb` would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
