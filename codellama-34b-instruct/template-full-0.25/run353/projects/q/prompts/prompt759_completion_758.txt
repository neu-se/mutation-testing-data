  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "allResolved" would cause the function to be called again, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "allSettled" would cause the function to be called with a different argument, leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled", "allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional "allRejected" would cause the function to be called with a different argument, leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
