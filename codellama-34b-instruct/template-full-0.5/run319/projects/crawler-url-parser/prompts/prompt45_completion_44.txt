  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL to be parsed without resolving the base URL, leading to a different set of parsed URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL to be parsed with resolving the base URL, but without normalizing the URL components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL to be parsed without resolving the base URL, but with normalizing the URL components.

DONE.
