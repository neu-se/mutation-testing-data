 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL\_CHARACTER constant would be set to the string '1' instead of a non-printable character. This could lead to unexpected results when comparing or processing strings with the diff function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String.fromCharCode(Math.floor(Math.random() * 256))
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL\_CHARACTER constant would be set to a random character instead of a predefined non-printable character. This could lead to inconsistent behavior in the diff function, as it might not handle random characters as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String.fromCharCode(0x7F)
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL\_CHARACTER constant would be set to the DEL character (0x7F) instead of a non-printable character. This could lead
