  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would emit an error when an empty line is encountered, while the new code fragment would not emit an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
