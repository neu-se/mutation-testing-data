Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
/**
 * Our default sum is the [Kahan-Babuska algorithm](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1760/7d467cda1d0277ad272deb2113533131dc09.pdf).
 * This method is an improvement over the classical
 * [Kahan summation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm).
 * It aims at computing the sum of a list of numbers while correcting for
 * floating-point errors. Traditionally, sums are calculated as many
 * successive additions, each one with its own floating-point roundoff. These
 * losses in precision add up as the number of numbers increases. This alternative
 * algorithm is more accurate than the simple way of calculating sums by simple
 * addition.
 *
 * This runs in `O(n)`, linear time, with respect to the length of the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x input
 * @return {number} sum of all input numbers
 * @example
 * sum([1, 2, 3]); // => 6
 */
function sum(x) {
    // If the array is empty, we needn't bother computing its sum
    if (x.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Initializing the sum as the first number in the array
    let sum = x[0];

    // Keeping track of the floating-point error correction
    let correction = 0;

    let transition;

    if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
        return NaN;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (typeof x[i] !== "number") {
            return NaN;
        }
        transition = sum + x[i];

        // Here we need to update the correction in a different fashion
        // if the new absolute value is greater than the absolute sum
        if (Math.abs(sum) >= Math.abs(x[i])) {
            correction += sum - transition + x[i];
        } else {
            correction += x[i] - transition + sum;
        }

        sum = transition;
    }

    // Returning the corrected sum
    return sum + correction;
}

export default sum;

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
typeof sum !== "number"
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
