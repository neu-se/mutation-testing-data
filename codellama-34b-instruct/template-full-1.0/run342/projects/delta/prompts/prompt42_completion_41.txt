  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode` expects a numerical character code as argument, while `null` is a null value and will cause the function to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode` expects a numerical character code as argument, while `''` is an empty string and will cause the function to return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode` expects a numerical character code as argument, while `undefined` is an undefined value and will cause the function to throw an exception.

DONE.
