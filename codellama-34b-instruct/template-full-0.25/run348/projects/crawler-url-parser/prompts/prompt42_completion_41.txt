  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://')

This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct a URL, and replacing `http://` with `https://` would change the protocol of the URL, potentially causing the code to fail if the URL is not compatible with the new protocol.

```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct a URL, and removing the `http://` protocol would change the URL, potentially causing the code to fail if the URL is not compatible with the new protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct a URL, and replacing `http://` with `ftp://` would change the protocol of the
