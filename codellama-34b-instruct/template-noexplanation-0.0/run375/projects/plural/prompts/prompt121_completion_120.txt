  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This modification will cause the plural function to always add an extra "s" to words ending in "ics", regardless of the input number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This modification will cause the plural function to always change the ending of words ending in "ics" to "es", regardless of the input number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This modification will cause the plural function to always change the ending of words ending in "ics" to "i", regardless of the input number.

DONE.
