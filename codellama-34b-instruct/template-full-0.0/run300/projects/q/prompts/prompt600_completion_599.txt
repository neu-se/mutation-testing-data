  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array with the original `args` array concatenated with itself, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would return a new array with the original `args` array reversed, which would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments.

DONE.
