  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would fulfill the promise, instead of rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error` would throw an error, instead of rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of progress, instead of rejecting it.

DONE.
