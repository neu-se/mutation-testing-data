  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

delta.ops[delta.ops.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]` refers to the last element of the `delta.ops` array, while `delta.ops[delta.ops.length]` refers to the next element after the last element, which is out of bounds and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]` refers to the last element of the `delta.ops` array, while `delta.ops[0]` refers to the first element of the array, which could be entirely different and would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

null
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]` refers to the last element of
