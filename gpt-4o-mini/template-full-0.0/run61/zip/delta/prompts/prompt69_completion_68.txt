Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof length === 'string' && length.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `length` is a string with a positive length, which would allow the method to proceed even when `length` is not a number, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof length === 'number' && length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the method to proceed when `length` is a positive number, which is the opposite of the original intent to return early for non-positive lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `length` is exactly zero, allowing the method to proceed for any other non-zero values, which could lead to incorrect operations being performed.

DONE.
