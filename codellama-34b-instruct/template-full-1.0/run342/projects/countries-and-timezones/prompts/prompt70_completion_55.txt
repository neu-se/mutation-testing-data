  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function when the PLACEHOLDER is reached, which would update the `timezones` object and potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getTimezone` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getTimezone` function to return `null` instead of the expected timezone object.
DONE.
