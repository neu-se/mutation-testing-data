  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object passed to `getCountry` would have a different value for the `deprecated` property, which could affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { allTimezones: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object passed to `getCountry` would have a different value for the `allTimezones` property, which could affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { timezones: [] })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object passed to `getCountry` would have a different value for the `timezones` property, which could affect the behavior of the `getCountry` function
