  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regex to match all occurrences of `//` in the path, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regex to match `//` in a case-insensitive manner, which could result in false positives for paths that contain `//` in the middle of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//\s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\s` flag would cause the regex to match `//` only if it is followed by a whitespace character, which could result in false negatives for paths that contain `//` at the end of the path.

DONE.
