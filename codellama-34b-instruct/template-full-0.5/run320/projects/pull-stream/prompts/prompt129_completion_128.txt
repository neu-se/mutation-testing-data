  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function `cb` with the argument `null`, while this modified code fragment calls the callback function with the argument `i++`, which is the value of the variable `i` after it has been incremented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function `cb` with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls the callback function with two arguments, `null` and the value of the variable `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function `cb` with a single argument, while this modified code fragment calls the callback function with two arguments, `true` and the value of the variable `i` after it has been incremented.
