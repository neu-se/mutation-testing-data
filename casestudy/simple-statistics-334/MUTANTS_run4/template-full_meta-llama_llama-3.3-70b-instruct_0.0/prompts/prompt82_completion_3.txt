Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index used for the `quantileSelect` function call, potentially affecting the sorting and selection of quantiles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the left index instead of the right index, which could alter the range of values being considered for the quantile selection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a fixed value (the last index of the array) instead of the dynamically calculated index from the `indices` array, which could lead to incorrect quantile calculations.

DONE.
