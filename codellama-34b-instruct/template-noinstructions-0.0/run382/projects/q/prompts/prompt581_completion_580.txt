  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was "throw", which would throw an exception if the generator function throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was "throw", which would throw an exception if the generator function throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was "throw", which would throw an exception if the generator function throws an error.

DONE.
