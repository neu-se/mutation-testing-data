  DONE.
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `Math.abs(0 - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON']`, which is always true, even if the value of `this['im']` is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `Math.abs(-this['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON']`, which is always false, even if the value of `this['im']` is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `Math.abs(Math.abs(this['im']) - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON']`, which is always true if the value of `this['im']` is not
