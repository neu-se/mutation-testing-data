  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` does not advance the iterator, while `next()` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` advances the iterator, while `peek()` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.index(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `index()` advances the iterator to the specified index, while `peek()` does not.

DONE.
