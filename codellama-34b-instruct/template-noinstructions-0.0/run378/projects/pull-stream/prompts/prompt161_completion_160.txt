  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the second argument, even if `value` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` as the second argument, even if `value` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original `value` as the second argument, even if `value` is null.

DONE.
