  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire line, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(0)` would retain the entire line, whereas `inverted.retain` would only retain the line if it was not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(1)` would retain only the first character of the line, whereas `inverted.retain` would retain the entire line.

DONE.
