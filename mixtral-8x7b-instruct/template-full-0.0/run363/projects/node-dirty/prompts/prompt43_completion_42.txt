 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because JavaScript is sensitive to the order of parameters in function calls. The `fn` function would receive the `val` as the first argument and `key` as the second argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function is not designed to handle the parameters in this order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key + 'x', val
