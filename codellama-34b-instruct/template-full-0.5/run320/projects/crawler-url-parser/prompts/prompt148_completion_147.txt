  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to split the path, but the replacement code uses a backslash. This would cause the code to incorrectly split the path and potentially return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to split the path, but the replacement code uses a backslash. This would cause the code to incorrectly split the path and potentially return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"//"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a forward slash to split the path, but the replacement code uses a double forward slash. This would cause the code to incorrectly split the path and potentially return incorrect results.

DONE.
