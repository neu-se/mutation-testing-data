Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would lead to the function processing values instead of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` creates a new array instance from an array-like or iterable object, which may not preserve the intended mapping of keys to values, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, which would change the structure of the data being processed and potentially cause errors in the callback.

DONE.
