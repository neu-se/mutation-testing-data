  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol would be changed from HTTP to HTTPS, which could affect the way the URL is parsed and processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol would be changed from HTTP to FTP, which could affect the way the URL is parsed and processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol would be changed from HTTP to a relative protocol, which could affect the way the URL is parsed and processed.

DONE.
