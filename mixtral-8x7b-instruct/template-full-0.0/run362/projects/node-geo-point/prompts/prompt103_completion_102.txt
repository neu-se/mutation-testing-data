 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the longitude to 0, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the longitude to a random value between 0 and 1, instead of calculating it based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the longitude to the same value as the input's longitude, instead of calculating the destination point.

DONE.
