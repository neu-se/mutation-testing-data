  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment in the given code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now always returning true, regardless of the input. This means that the filter function will always return the entire list of operations, rather than only the operations that match the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now always returning false, regardless of the input. This means that the filter function will always return an empty list, even if there were valid operations in the list that should have been included in the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is now returning the opposite of what it should be returning. This means that the filter function will include operations in the result that should
