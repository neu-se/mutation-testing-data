 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the encoding scheme to ASCII, which may not support all characters in the input string, and could lead to data loss or incorrect parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the encoding scheme to base64, which is not compatible with JSON parsing and would result in an error when trying to parse the stringified object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
