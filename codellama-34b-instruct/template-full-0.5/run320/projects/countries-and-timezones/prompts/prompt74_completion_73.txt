  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the `name` string, whereas `name` would return the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.length` would return the length of the `name` string, whereas `name` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.split('')` would return an array of individual characters of the `name` string, whereas `name` would return the original string.

DONE.
