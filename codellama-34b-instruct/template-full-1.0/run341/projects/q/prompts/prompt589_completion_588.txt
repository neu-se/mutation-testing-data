  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` is a method that returns a promise for a future value, while `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise for an asynchronous function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise for an asynchronous function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` is a method that marks a promise as resolved, while `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise for an asynchronous function.

DONE.
