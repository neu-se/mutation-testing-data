  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would insert an element after the current one, while `delete` would remove the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would insert an element after the current one, while `insert` would insert an element before the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` would insert an element after the current one, while `pop` would remove the last element.

DONE.
