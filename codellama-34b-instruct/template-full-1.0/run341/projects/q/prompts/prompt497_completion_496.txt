  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `stack` property, so the `reason.stack` line would throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is now a string and does not have a `stack` property, so the `reason.stack` line would throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is now an `Error` object and does not have a `stack` property, so the `reason.stack` line would return `undefined` instead of a stack trace.

DONE.
