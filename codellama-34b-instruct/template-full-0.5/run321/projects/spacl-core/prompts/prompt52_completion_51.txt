  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty string to the `parts` array, which would not match any part of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value to the `parts` array, which would not match any part of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an `undefined` value to the `parts` array, which would not match any part of the path.

DONE.
