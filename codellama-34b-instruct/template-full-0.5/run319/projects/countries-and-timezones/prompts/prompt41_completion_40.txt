  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start with an initial value of `prev + 1`, which would affect the final result of the reduction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start with an initial value of `prev * 2`, which would affect the final result of the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce()` method would start with an initial value of `prev - 1`, which would affect the final result of the reduction.

DONE.
