  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `== null` checks for both `null` and `undefined`, while `=== undefined` only checks for `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `!row.val` checks for any falsy value, while `row.val === undefined` only checks for `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `=== null` checks for `null`, while `row.val === undefined` checks for `undefined`.

DONE.
