  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a `Tile` object, while the mutated code returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a `Tile` object with the correct coordinates, while the mutated code returns a `Tile` object with coordinates of (0, 0).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(this.longitude, this.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a `Tile` object with the correct coordinates, while the mutated code returns a `Tile` object with coordinates that are swapped (i.e., the longitude and latitude are reversed).

DONE.
