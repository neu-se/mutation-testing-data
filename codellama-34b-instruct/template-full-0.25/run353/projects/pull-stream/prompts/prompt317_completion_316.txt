  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was called with `ended` as an argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In this option, `cb` is called with `data` as an argument, which is a data object that may not be a boolean value. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting a data object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was called with `ended` as an argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In this option, `cb` is called with `!data` as an argument, which is the negation of the data object. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting a negated data object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
