  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This change will cause the `unique` function to return a different result for the same input, as it will be adding 1 to the `field` value before passing it to the `filter` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This change will cause the `unique` function to return a different result for the same input, as it will be subtracting 1 from the `field` value before passing it to the `filter` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This change will cause the `unique` function to return a different result for the same input, as it will be multiplying the `field` value by 2 before passing it to the `filter` function.

DONE.
