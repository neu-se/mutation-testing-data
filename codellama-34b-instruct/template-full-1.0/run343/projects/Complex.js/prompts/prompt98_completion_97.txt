  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length > i+1 && (tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a check for the length of the `tokens` array, and only executes the block if the length is greater than `i+1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the token is not equal to `'i'` or `'I'`, and only executes the block if the token is not equal to either of those.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the token is equal to `'j'` or `'J
