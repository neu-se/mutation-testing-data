  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function, but `makeNodeResolver()` is a method that returns a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function, but `makeNodeResolver()` is a method that returns a function.

DONE.
