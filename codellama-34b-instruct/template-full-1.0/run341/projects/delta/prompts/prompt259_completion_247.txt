  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now insert the object `thisOp` instead of `otherOp.insert`, which may have different properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now insert the length of the `insert` property of `otherOp` instead of `otherOp.insert`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string or does not have a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now insert `null` instead of `otherOp.insert`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is a string or has certain properties or methods.

DONE.
