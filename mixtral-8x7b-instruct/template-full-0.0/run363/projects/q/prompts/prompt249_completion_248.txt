 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` uses a regular expression and returns the index of the first match, while `indexOf` searches for a specific substring and returns the index of its first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` searches for a specific substring from the end of the string and returns the index of its last occurrence, while `indexOf` searches for a specific substring from the beginning of the string and returns the index of its first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.toString().indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` converts the error object to a string, which may not contain the same information as the `stack` property. The `indexOf` method would then search for the substring in the string representation of the error object
