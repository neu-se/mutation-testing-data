  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejected` function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `rejected` function with the `self` context. This would cause the `rejected` function to be called with a different context, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejected` function, while the buggy code fragment is a call to the `rejected` function with the `exception` argument. This would cause the `rejected` function to be called with a different argument, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(exception, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejected`
