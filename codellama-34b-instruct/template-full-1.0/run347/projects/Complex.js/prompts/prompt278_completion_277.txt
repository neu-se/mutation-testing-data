  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the argument of the cosh function by 1, which would change the resulting value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the argument of the cosh function, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine function instead of the cosine function, which would change the resulting value.

DONE.
