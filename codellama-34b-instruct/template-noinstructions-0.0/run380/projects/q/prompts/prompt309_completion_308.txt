  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would throw an error with the message "reject", whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("reject"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would return a rejected promise with the reason "reject", whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
