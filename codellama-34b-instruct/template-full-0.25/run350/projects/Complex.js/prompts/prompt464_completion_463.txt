  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round()` rounds a number to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
