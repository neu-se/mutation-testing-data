  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dipatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` method is replaced with `dispatch` method which is different from the original method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dhan
```
This would result in different behavior because `dhan` is not a recognized method in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` method is replaced with `ninvoke` method which is the same as the original method.

DONE.
