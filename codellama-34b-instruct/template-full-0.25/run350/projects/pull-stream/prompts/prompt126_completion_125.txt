  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the ">" operator, which checks if the value of "i" is strictly greater than "max". The new code fragment uses the ">=" operator, which checks if the value of "i" is greater than or equal to "max". This change would cause the function to return a different value when "i" is equal to "max".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the ">" operator, which checks if the value of "i" is strictly greater than "max". The new code fragment uses the "<" operator, which checks if the value of "i" is strictly less than "max". This change would cause the function to return a different value when "i" is equal to "max".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
