  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the property exists and is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || object[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the property exists or is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the property exists and is not `null`.

DONE.
