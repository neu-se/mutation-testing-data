  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called, and the progress notification would not be propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with an empty function as the argument, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
