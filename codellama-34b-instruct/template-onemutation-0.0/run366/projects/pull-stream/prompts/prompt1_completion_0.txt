  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `in` operator to iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `for` loop to iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, starting from 0. The `for` loop will only iterate over the keys that are greater than or equal to 0, while the `in` operator will iterate over all keys, regardless of their value.

DONE.
