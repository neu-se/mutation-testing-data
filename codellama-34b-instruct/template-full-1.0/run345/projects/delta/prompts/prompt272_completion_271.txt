  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (iter.hasNext)
```
This would result in different behavior because "while" loop will iterate even if there is no next element, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (iter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only loop through the portion of the code that involves insertions, whereas the original code would loop through all the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (iter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only loop through the portion of the code that involves deletions and retains, whereas the original code would loop through all the code.

DONE.
