  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the string is greater than 0, while the mutated code is checking if the string is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the string is greater than 0, while the mutated code is checking if the string is less than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking the length of the string, while the mutated code is calling the `String.length` method on the string, which would return the length of the string.

DONE.
