 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'round' method would always return a complex number with the real part equal to 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'round' method would always round the real part towards 1, instead of rounding it to the nearest integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'round' method would round the imaginary part instead of the real part, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
