  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the characters '^' and '$' at the beginning and end of the character class, respectively. This would cause the regular expression to match any string that contains any character other than the specified set of characters, rather than just matching the first occurrence of such a character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the 'i' flag at the end, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive. This would cause the regular expression to match any string that contains any character other than the specified set of characters, regardless
