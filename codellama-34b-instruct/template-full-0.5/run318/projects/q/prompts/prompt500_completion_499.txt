  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the `this` value bound to the provided value, whereas `apply` calls the function with the provided value as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method for concatenating arrays, and it would not make sense in this context.

DONE.
