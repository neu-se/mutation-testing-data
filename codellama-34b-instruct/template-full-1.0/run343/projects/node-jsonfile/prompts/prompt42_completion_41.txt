  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because before it was assigned to the  stringified file contents object is now assigned to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because it now includes an additional argument, options.reviver, in the call to stringify, which did not exist before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(stringify(obj))
```
This would result in different behavior because it now includes an additional call to JSON.parse, which is not pres condstr.io format.

DONE.
