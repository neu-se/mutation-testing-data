  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<deferred()>
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred()` returns a new Deferred object, rather than using the existing one, which would cause the Promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<deferred.resolve()>
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would immediately resolve the Promise with the given value, rather than waiting for the other Promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<>
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty template would cause the Promise to be resolved with an empty value, rather than waiting for the other Promises to settle.

DONE.
