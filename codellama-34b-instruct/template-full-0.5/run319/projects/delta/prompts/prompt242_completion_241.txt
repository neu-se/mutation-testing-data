  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an iterator for the other delta, while `thisIter` is an iterator for the current delta. Using `otherIter.peekLength` would cause the code to use the length of the other delta, rather than the current delta, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the current delta plus one, rather than the length of the current delta. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the current delta has a length that is not one greater than the length of the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength, otherIter.peekLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the maximum of the length of the current delta and
