  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` array only has two elements, so accessing the third element would return `undefined`, which would cause the `plural` function to return the original word instead of the expected plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` array only has two elements, so accessing the first element would return the `match` regex, which would cause the `plural` function to return the original word instead of the expected plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original word concatenated with the string 's', regardless of the input word or the rules defined in the `rules` array.

DONE.
