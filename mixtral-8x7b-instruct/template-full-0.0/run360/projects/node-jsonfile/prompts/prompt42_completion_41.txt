 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned string from `stringify` is now being multiplied by 1, which will not affect the original value but is still technically different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict'
stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `'use strict'` to the top of the file changes the parsing and execution context of the code, potentially causing issues with the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which `stringify` is called, potentially causing issues if `stringify` is not defined in the global scope.

DONE.
