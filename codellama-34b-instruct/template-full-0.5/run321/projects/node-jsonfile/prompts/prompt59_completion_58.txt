  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/ /g` matches a single space character, whereas the original `/\n/g` matches any newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\n]/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^\n]/g` matches any character that is not a newline character, whereas the original `/\n/g` matches any newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\n]/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[\n]/g` matches any newline character, whereas the original `/\n/g` matches any newline character.

DONE.
