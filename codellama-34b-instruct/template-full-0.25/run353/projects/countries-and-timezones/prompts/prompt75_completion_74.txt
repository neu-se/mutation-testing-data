  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an invalid timezone name, which would cause it to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a timezone name in uppercase, which would cause it to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a timezone name with the characters in reverse order, which would cause it to return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
