  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only retain the first character of the `insert` property, rather than the entire value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only delete the first character of the `delete` property, rather than the entire value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only retain the first character of the `retain` property, rather than the entire value.

DONE.
