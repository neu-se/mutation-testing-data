  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to `1`, while the new code fragment checks if `1` is not equal to `b`. This change in the order of the operands would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
