  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the original `Q` object that was used in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, which is not the same as the original `Q` object that was used in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, which is not the same as the original `Q` object that was used in the code.

DONE.
