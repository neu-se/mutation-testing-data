  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\$2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\${1}'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\${1}`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is incorrect, it should be `\\$1` instead of `\\$0`.

DONE.
