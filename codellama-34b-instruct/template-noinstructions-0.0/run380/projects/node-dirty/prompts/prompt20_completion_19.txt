  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the `_queue` is not empty, but this modified code fragment would call `_flush` unconditionally, potentially causing unnecessary writes to the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the `_queue` is not empty, but this modified code fragment would call `_flush` unconditionally, potentially causing unnecessary writes to the database.
