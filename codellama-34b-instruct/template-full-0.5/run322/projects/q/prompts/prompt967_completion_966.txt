  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `args` array as an argument to `Q.nbind`, while this modified code fragment also passes the `arguments` object as an argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the entire `args` array as an argument to `Q.nbind`, while this modified code fragment only passes all but the last element of the `args` array as an argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `args` array as an argument to `Q.nbind`, while this modified code fragment passes
