  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object as its first argument, but 1 is not an object. The function would throw a `TypeError` when it tries to iterate over the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object as its first argument, and `{}` is an object. The function would try to stringify the object, which would result in an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ a: 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object as its first argument, and `{ a: 1 }` is an object with a property `a` that has the value `1`. The function would try to stringify the object, which would result in the string `"{ a: 1 }"`.

DONE.
