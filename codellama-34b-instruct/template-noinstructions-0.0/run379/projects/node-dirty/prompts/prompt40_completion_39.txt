  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `forEach` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is called with the `key` and `val` arguments, rather than being passed as a callback to the `forEach` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is called with the `key`, `val`, and `this` arguments, rather than being passed as a callback to the `forEach` method.

DONE.
