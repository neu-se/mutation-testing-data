  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
#\S*$
```
This would result in different behavior because "##" matches more than "#." in a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
[^a-zA-Z0-9!-]+
```
This would result in different behavior because "aaaaa" is not matched by" \w+".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
_.+;$
```
This would result in different behavior because "url" does not contain "_".

DONE.
