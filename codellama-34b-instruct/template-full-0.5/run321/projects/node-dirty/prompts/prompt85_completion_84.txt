  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of strings, but the replacement code fragment uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.slice(0, buffer.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of strings, but the replacement code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.match(/\\n/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of strings, but the replacement code fragment uses the `match` method to search for a pattern in the buffer.

DONE.
