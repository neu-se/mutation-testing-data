  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `value` to be a promise, but this replacement would cause the code to resolve the promise with the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("foo"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `value` to be a promise, but this replacement would cause the code to reject the promise with the error "foo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects `value` to be a promise, but this replacement would cause the code to resolve the promise with the value `null`.

DONE.
