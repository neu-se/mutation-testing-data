  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` is falsy or if its `apply` method is not a function, while this replacement checks if the `callback` is truthy and if its `apply` method is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` is falsy or if its `apply` method is not a function, while this replacement checks if the `callback` is truthy and if its `apply` method is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` is falsy or if its `apply` method is not a function, while this replacement checks if the `
