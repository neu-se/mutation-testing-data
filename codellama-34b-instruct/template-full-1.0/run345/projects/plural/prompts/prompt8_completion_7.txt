  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty array would be pushed onto the `rules` array rather than the `match` and `result` pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `match` and `result` arguments would be reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['foo', 'bar']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` and `result` arguments would be replaced with the fixed values `'foo'` and `'bar'`, which would likely break the code.

DONE.
