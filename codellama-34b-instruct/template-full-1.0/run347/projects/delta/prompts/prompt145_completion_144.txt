  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.pop` would remove the last operation from the list, whereas `ops.push` adds a new operation to the end of the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.push` would add a new operation to the end of the `this` object, whereas `ops.push` adds a new operation to the end of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.push` would add a new operation to the end of the `other` object, whereas `ops.push` adds a new operation to the end of the `ops` array.

DONE.
