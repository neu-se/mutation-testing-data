Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly reports the size of the data as one more than the actual size, which could lead to inconsistencies in the application logic that relies on the correct size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the keys array instead of the size of the data, which may not accurately reflect the number of entries if the data structure does not directly correlate with the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.get('nonexistentKey')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to retrieve a value using a key that does not exist, which would return `undefined` instead of the actual size of the data, leading to potential errors in downstream logic that expects a valid size.

DONE.
