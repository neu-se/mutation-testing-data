  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new string with the first character removed, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

DONE.
