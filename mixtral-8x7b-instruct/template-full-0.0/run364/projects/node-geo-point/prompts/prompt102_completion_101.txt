 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180/Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, while this replacement simply divides 180 by PI, which would give incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y/x) * (180/Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement calculates the arctangent of `y/x` and then converts it to degrees, which is not equivalent to the original `rad2deg` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) * (180/Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement uses `Math.atan2` instead of `Math.atan`, which would give incorrect results for certain input values.

DONE.
