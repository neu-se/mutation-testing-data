  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (result) {
    return result;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called on the promise, but the `then` method would not be called on the result of `inspect`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (result) {
    return result.value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called on the promise, and the `then` method would be called on the result of `inspect`, but the `value` property would not be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (result) {
    return result.value.then(function (value) {
        return value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the
