  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a resolved promise with the value `value`, while this modified code fragment throws an error and returns a rejected promise with the reason `"error"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a resolved promise with the value `value`, while this modified code fragment returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a resolved promise with the value `value`, while this modified code fragment returns a resolved promise with the value `null`.

DONE.
