  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now `'drain'` instead of `'foo'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'bar');
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now `'drain'` instead of `'bar'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'baz');
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now `'drain'` instead of `'baz'`, which could cause the event listener to not be triggered.

DONE.
