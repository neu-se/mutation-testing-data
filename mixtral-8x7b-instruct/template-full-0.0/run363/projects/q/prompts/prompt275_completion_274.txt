 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which changes the expected outcome when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with an empty function, which would not reject the promise, causing the error to go unnoticed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately with a value, instead of waiting for the error to occur and rejecting the promise. This change hides the error and alters the expected behavior of the code.

DONE.
