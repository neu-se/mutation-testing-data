  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` argument is not passed to the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `null` value instead of the expected error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` argument is not passed to the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an `undefined` value instead of the expected error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object is created and passed to the `deferred.reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error object than the expected one.

DONE.
