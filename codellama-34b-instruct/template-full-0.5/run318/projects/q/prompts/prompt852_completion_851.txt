  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an error instead of being rejected, which could cause the test to pass when it should fail.

DONE.
