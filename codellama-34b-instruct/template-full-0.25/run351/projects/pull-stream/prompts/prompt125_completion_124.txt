  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
