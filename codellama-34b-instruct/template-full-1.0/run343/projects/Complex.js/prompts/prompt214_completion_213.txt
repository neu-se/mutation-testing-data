  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 <div>
                const func = context.bindings.func;
                func.entryPoint();
            </div>
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function named `func` being assigned to a `const` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const type = typeof b
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the type of `b` is an object, which returns false if `b` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the variable `b` is `null` or not, which returns true if `b` is `null`.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option 3.
