  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument of the function, which is the object on which the method is being invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments of the function, which are the object on which the method is being invoked and the name of the method being invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first three arguments of the function, which are the object on which the method is being invoked, the name of the method being invoked, and the arguments to the method.

DONE.
