  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of a URL path, while the new code fragment uses a backslash. This could cause the URL parsing function to misinterpret the URL and return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of a URL path, while the new code fragment uses an empty string. This could cause the URL parsing function to misinterpret the URL and return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a forward slash to indicate the end of a URL path, while the new code fragment uses a space character. This could cause the URL parsing function to misinterpret the URL and return incorrect results.

DONE.
