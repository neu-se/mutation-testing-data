  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not log the callback function, whereas this modified code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the callback function is truthy, whereas this modified code checks if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not check if the callback function is truthy, whereas this modified code does.

DONE.
