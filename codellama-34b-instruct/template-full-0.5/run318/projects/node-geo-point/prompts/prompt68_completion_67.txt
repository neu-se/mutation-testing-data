  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `x`, which was a variable in the `calculateBearing` function. Replacing it with `1` would cause the function to always return `1`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `x`, which was a variable in the `calculateBearing` function. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the function to always return `-1`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `x`, which was a variable in the `calculateBearing` function. Replacing it with `0` would cause the function to always return `0`, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
