  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expression would not return the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (args.length > 0) {
    return args[0];
} else {
    return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expression would not return the expected value for certain argument arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.forEach(function (arg) {
    console.log(arg);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expression would perform a different side effect.

DONE.
