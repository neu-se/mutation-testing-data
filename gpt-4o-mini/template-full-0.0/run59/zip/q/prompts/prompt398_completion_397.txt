Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the original value, it would resolve with `null`, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, which is different from the original value and could cause issues if the subsequent code expects a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the string `"error"` instead of the original value, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's resolution in the following `.then()` calls.

DONE.
