  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the `^` character at the beginning, which negates the character class and matches any character that is not in the class. This means that the rule would apply to words that do not end in "o", rather than words that end in "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the `s` character at the end, which matches any character that is not in the class, and the function has been modified to return "s" instead of "es". This means that the rule would apply to words that do not end in "o", and the plural form would be "s" instead of "es".
