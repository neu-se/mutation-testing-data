  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function that dispatches an event, while `this.post` is a function that sends a POST request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function that dispatches an event, while `this.get` is a function that sends a GET request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.put
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is a function that dispatches an event, while `this.put` is a function that sends a PUT request.

DONE.
