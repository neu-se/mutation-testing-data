  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to match "woman" instead of "man", but the replacement function is still the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'u') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to match "woman" instead of "man", and the replacement function has been modified to replace "o" with "u".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
