 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 20)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose a zoom level between 0 and 19, instead of using the provided `zoom` level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a zoom level of 1, regardless of the provided `zoom` level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the coordinate as the zoom level, instead of using the provided `zoom` level.

DONE.
