 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(op: any, index: any) => predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `any` instead of the correct types for the parameters, potentially causing type-related issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(op, index) => predicate(index, op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters, causing the predicate to receive incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(op, index) => predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes one argument to the predicate function, while the original implementation passes two arguments.

DONE.
