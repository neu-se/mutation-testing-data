  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer().resolve()` would return a resolved promise, while `defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer().reject()` would return a rejected promise, while `defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer().notify()` would return a promise that is already notified, while `defer` returns a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected later.

DONE.
