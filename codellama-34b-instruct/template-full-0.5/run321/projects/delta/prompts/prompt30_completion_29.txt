  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and is not undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` or is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and is not undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and is not null.
