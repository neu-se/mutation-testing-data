 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine function instead of the deg2rad function, which is used to convert degrees to radians. This would cause incorrect calculations in the calculateBearing method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, regardless of the input value. This would cause incorrect calculations in the calculateBearing method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
