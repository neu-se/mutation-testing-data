  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Failed to makeNodeResolver"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a new node resolver, while this replacement code fragment calls `deferred.reject()` to reject the promise with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a new node resolver, while this replacement code fragment calls `deferred.resolve()` to resolve the promise with the node resolver.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a new node resolver, while this replacement code fragment calls `deferred.notify()` to notify the promise
