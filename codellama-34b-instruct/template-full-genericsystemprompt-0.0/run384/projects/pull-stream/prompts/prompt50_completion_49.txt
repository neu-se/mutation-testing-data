  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` may not be a function, but it may still be an instance of a class that has a `source` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `s` may not be a function, but it may still have a `constructor` property that refers to the `Function` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype` is a property of a function that refers to the object that will be used as the prototype of objects created by the function
