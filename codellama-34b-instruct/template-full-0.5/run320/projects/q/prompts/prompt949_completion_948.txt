  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different ways of calling the function. `call` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument of `bind`, and has the same arguments as the original function. It does not call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representing the source code of the function, while `call` and `apply` call the function.

DONE.
