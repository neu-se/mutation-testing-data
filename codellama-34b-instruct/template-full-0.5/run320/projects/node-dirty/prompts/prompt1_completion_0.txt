  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` method is not being called, and the cache is not being populated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Testing mutation'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` method is being called, but it is throwing an error, which is not expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._data = new Map(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` method is being called, but it is resetting the cache to an empty map, which is not expected.

DONE.
