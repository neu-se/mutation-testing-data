  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of a URL object, which would cause the `extract` function to return an empty array instead of an array of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a URL object with a `host` property set to `null`, which would cause the `extract` function to return an empty array instead of an array of URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a URL object with an empty `pathname` property, which would cause the `extract` function to return an empty array instead of an array of URLs.

DONE.
