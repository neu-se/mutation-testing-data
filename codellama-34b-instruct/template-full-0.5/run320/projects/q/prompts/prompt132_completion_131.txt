  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` is a function that returns a string representing the object's type, whereas `Object.prototype.toString` is a function that returns a string representing the object's type and its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()

This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property and it is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf.call()` is a function that returns the object's primitive value, whereas `
