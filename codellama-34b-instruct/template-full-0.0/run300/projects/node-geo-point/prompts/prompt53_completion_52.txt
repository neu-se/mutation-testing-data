  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 180` would shift the bearing by 180 degrees, causing the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the bearing, causing the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 180` would shift the bearing by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, causing the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
