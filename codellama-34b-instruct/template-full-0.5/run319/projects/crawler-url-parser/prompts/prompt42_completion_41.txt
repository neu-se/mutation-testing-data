  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the base URL, which would cause the URL parsing function to fail and return null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http", "ftp")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "http" protocol with "ftp", which would cause the URL parsing function to fail and return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the base URL, which would cause the URL parsing function to fail and return null.

DONE.
