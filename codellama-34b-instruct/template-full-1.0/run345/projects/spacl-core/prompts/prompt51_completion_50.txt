  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(1)` would return the substring of `part` starting from the second character, whereas `part.slice(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the substring of `part` starting from a position specified by the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(-1)` would return the substring of `part` ending at the last character, whereas `part.slice(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the substring of `part` starting from a position specified by the value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(part.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(part.length - 1)` would return the substring of `
