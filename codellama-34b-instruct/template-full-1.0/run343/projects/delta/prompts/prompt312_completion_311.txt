  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { x: 1 }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` is replaced with an object with a property `x` set to `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { y: 2 }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` is replaced with an object with a property `y` set to `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, { z: 3 }, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` is replaced with an object with a property `z` set to `3`.

DONE.
