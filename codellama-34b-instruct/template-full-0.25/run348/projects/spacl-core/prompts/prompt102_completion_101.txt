  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `ctx`, potentially causing the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `ctx` would return a different value than the original `ctx` variable, potentially causing the `query` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different subset of `ctx`, potentially causing the `query` method to return a different result.

DONE.
