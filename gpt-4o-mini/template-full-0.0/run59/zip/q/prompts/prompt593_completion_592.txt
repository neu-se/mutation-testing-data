Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(self, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments, while `apply` expects an array of arguments, potentially leading to incorrect argument handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(self)(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, but it does not immediately invoke the function with the arguments, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the `this` context means that the function will not have access to the intended context, which could lead to errors if the function relies on `this` being set to `self`.

DONE.
