  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `compression` property is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `compression` property is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `compression` property is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium`.

DONE.
