  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 0 instead of the actual length of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always check the length of the operation in the other iterator instead of the operation in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always check the length of the operation in the other iterator instead of the operation in the current iterator, and it would also fail if the operation in the other iterator is not an insert operation.

DONE.
