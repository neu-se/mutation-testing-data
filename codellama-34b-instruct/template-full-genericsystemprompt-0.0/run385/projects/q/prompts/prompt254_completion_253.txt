  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the first element removed, instead of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(["new element"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the new element added to the end, instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with each element multiplied by 2, instead of the original array.

DONE.
