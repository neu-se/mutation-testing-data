  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Node.js process to terminate immediately, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.enopped = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `enopped` function, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function noop() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new, empty function called `noop`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
