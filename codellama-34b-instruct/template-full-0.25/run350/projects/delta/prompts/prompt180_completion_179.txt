  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the length of the string, which would cause the diff algorithm to compare the strings with an offset of 1 character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be doubling the length of the string, which would cause the diff algorithm to compare the strings with a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the length of the string, which would cause the diff algorithm to compare the strings with an extra character at the end.

DONE.
