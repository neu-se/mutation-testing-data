  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `exception` object, which is an instance of the `Error` class, and the new code fragment is using the `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `exception` object, which is an instance of the `Error` class, and the new code fragment is using the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `exception` object, which is an instance of the `Error` class, and the new code fragment is using a new instance of the `Error` class.

DONE.
