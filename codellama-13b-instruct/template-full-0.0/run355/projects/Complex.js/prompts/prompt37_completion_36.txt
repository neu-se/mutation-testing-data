  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `b` variable instead of the `a` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the `a` and `b` variables instead of accessing them individually.

DONE.
