  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled instead of rejected, leading to unexpected results in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered pending instead of rejected, leading to unexpected results in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled instead of rejected, leading to unexpected results in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
