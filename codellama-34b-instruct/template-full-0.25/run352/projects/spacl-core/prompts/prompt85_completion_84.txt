  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with `null` as the name and `false` as the deep copy flag, which would create a new policy with a different name and without cloning the underlying rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(this.name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with the current policy's name and a deep copy flag of `true`, which would create a new policy with the same name and clone the underlying rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(this.name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would be called with the current policy's name and a deep copy flag of `false`, which would create a new policy with the same name but without cloning
