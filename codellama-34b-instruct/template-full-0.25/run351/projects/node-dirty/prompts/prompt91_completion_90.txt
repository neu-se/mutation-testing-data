  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

DONE.
