  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This code fragment will return the directory name of the path, rather than the base name. This will cause the code to fail if the path is not a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This code fragment will return the file extension of the path, rather than the base name. This will cause the code to fail if the path does not have a file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename + '.txt'
```
This code fragment will return the base name of the path with a '.txt' extension, rather than the base name. This will cause the code to fail if the path does not have a '.txt' extension.

DONE.
