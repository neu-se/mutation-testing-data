  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `inspect` method is only called if `inspect` is undefined, while in the new code, `inspect` is called if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect() !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `inspect` method is not called if it is undefined, while in the new code, `inspect` is called if it is not undefined, and then the return value is compared to `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect() === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `inspect` method is called if it is undefined, while in the new code, `inspect` is called if it is not undefined, and then the return value is compared to `void 0`.
