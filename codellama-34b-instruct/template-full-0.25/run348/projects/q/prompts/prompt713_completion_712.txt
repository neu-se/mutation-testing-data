  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for the "dispatch" function, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the "dispatch" function is an array of arguments, and passing [1] as the second argument would cause the "keys" method to be called with an argument, which would result in a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing ["foo"] as the second argument would cause the "keys" method to be called with a different argument, which would result in a different return value.

DONE.
