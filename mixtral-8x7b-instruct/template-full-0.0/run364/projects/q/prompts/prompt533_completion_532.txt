 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error is thrown instead of using the `fulfilled` function, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the argument to `fulfilled` instead of the actual value, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is passed as the argument to `fulfilled` instead of the actual value, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

DONE.
