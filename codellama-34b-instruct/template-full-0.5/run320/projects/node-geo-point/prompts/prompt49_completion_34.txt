  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2.longitude` is a different value than `point2.latitude`, and would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a value that is 1 degree different than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a value that is twice as large as the original code fragment.

DONE.
