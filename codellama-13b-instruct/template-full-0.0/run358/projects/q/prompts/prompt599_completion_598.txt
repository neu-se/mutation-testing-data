  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is not defined, and the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable would be set to null, and the code would throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable would be set to an empty array, and the code would throw a TypeError.

DONE.
