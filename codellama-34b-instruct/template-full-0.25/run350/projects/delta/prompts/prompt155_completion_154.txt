  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue even if there are no more operations in the other iterator, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue even if there are no more operations in the this iterator, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to continue even if the next operation in the other iterator is not an insert, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
