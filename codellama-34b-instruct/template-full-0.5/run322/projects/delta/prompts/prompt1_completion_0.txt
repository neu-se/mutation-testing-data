  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` would return `true` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would only return `true` if `a` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Object(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== Object(a)` would return `true` if `a` is not an object, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would only return `true` if `a` is not an object or a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.toString.call(a).includes('Object')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Object.prototype.toString.call(a).includes('Object')` would return `true` if `a` is not an object, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would only return `true
