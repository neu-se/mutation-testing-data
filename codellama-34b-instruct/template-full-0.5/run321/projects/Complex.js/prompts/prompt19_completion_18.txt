  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `y`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of `hypot`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `y`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of `hypot`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the value of `y`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of `hypot`.

DONE.
