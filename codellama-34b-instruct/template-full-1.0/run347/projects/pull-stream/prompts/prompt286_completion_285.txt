  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is always truthy, so the code would always execute the `return cb(err)` statement, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end) data = mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would only execute the `data = mapper(data)` statement if `end` is truthy, so the code would only call `mapper` on `data` if `end` is falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? mapper(data) : data
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would only execute the `mapper(data)` statement if `end` is truthy, so the code would only call `mapper` on `data` if `end` is falsey.

DONE.
