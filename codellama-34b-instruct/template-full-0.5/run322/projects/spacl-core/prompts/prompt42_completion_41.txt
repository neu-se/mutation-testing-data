  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the part of the string without the last character, which could cause the code to not match the expected path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the part of the string in reverse order, which could cause the code to not match the expected path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all alphanumeric characters and underscores from the part of the string, which could cause the code to not match the expected path.

DONE.
