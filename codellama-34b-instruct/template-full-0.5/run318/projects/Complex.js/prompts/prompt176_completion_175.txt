  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return a complex number with a positive real part and a zero imaginary part, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.abs(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return a complex number with a real part that is one greater than the absolute value of the input, and a zero imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.abs(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to always return a complex number with a real part that is one less than the absolute value of the input, and a zero imaginary part.

DONE.
