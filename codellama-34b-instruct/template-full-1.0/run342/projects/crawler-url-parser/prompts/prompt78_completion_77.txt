  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only select anchor elements that are direct children of the document, rather than all anchor elements within the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('[href]')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all elements that have an href attribute, regardless of their tag name, rather than just anchor elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a, [href]')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all anchor elements and elements with href attributes, regardless of their tag name, rather than just anchor elements.

DONE.
