  Option 1:
```
this._emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `_emit` instead of `emit`, which is a different method in the `Dirty` class.

Option 2:
```
emit('write_close')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different event than the original code, which could cause confusion and unexpected behavior in the test suite.

Option 3:
```
this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different event than the original code, which could cause confusion and unexpected behavior in the test suite.

DONE.
