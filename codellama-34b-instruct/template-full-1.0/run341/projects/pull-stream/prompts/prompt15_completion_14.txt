  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args || null` always evaluates to `null`, whereas `args == null` only evaluates to `true` if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args && null
```
This would result in different behavior because `args && null` always evaluates to `null`, whereas `args == null` only evaluates to `true` if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args?.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args?.length === 0` checks if `args` is an array or an object with a `length` property, whereas `args == null` only checks if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
