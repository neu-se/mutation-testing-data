  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"plus", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being invoked is different. Instead of `delete`, `plus` would be called, which would result in the property being set to a value rather than being deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"increment", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being invoked is different. Instead of `delete`, `increment` would be called, which would result in the property being incremented rather than being deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push". [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being invoked is different. Instead of `delete`, `push` would be called, which would result in the property being added to an array rather than being deleted.

DONE.
