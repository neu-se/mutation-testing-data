  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes an operation onto the delta, while the new code pushes a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes an operation onto the delta, while the new code pushes the next operation from the other iterator onto the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes an operation onto the delta, while the new code pushes the next operation from the this iterator onto the delta.

DONE.
