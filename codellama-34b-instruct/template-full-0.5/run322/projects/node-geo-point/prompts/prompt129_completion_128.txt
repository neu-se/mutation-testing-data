  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a zoom level that is one level lower than the original code, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a zoom level that is one level higher than the original code, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.toTile(zoom * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a zoom level that is twice the original code, which could result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
