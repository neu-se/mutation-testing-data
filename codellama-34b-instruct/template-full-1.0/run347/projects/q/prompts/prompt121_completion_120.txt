  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object_keys(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks if a property is present in an object, whereas the original code fragment was simply iterating over the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first character of each property name, whereas the original code fragment returned the entire property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key. charset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the ASCII code of the first character of each property name, whereas the original code fragment returned the entire property name.

DONE.
