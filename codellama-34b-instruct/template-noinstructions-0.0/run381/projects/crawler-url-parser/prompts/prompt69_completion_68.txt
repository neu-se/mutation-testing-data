  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` would be set to a specific URL, whereas the original code uses the `sourceUrl` as the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path/to/file"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` would be set to a specific URL with a path, whereas the original code uses the `sourceUrl` as the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path/to/file?query=string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` would be set to a specific URL with a path and query string, whereas the original code uses the `sourceUrl` as the base URL.

DONE.
