  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress listener is an array and accessing `[0]` would cause the code to fail if the array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolvedPromise` variable is not defined in this scope and referencing it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` cannot be called as a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
