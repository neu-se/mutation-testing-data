  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the first element of the iterator, instead of the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return the last element of the iterator, instead of the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would always return a random element of the iterator, instead of the next element.

DONE.
