  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a delay in milliseconds as its second argument, and `1` is a valid delay of 1 millisecond.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a delay in milliseconds as its second argument, and `-1` is a valid delay of -1 millisecond.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a delay in milliseconds as its second argument, and `null` is not a valid delay value.

DONE.
