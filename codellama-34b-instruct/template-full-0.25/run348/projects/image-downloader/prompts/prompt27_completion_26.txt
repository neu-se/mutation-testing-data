  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `options.url` value as the first argument to the `request` function, instead of the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `options.dest` value as the first argument to the `request` function, instead of the `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `options.url` and `options.dest` values and pass the resulting string as the first argument to the `request` function, instead of the `options` object.

DONE.
