  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "pending" state, while this code fragment checks for the "rejected" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state, while this code fragment checks for a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state, while this code fragment checks for the "fulfilled" state and a value of undefined.

DONE.
