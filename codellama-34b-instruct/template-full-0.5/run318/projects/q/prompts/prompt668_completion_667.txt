  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method, while this code uses the "apply" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method, while this code uses the "apply" method, and the arguments passed to the "apply" method are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method, while this code uses the "apply" method, and the arguments passed to the "apply" method are different.

DONE.
