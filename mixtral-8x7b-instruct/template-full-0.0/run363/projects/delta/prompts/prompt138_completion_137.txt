 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && firstLeft <= thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator for `firstLeft` and `thisIter.peekLength()` is changed, which would affect the order of operations being compared.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` is changed to `'delete'`, which would cause the following code block to be executed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && firstLeft < thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator for `firstLeft` and `thisIter.peekLength()` is changed to `<`, which would affect the order of operations being
