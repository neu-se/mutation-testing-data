  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the first point would be used instead of the latitude of the second point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the second point would be increased by 1 degree, which would change the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the second point would be doubled, which would change the bearing calculation.

DONE.
