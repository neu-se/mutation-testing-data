  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the null character, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the string representation of the placeholder character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the start of heading (SOH) character, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the string representation of the placeholder character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the start of text (STX) character, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the string representation of the placeholder character.

DONE.
