  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendixies/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now /appendixies/i, causing the rule to only match words that end in "appendixies" instead of "appendix".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ces' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns the word "ces" instead of "ices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }.bind(this));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now bound to the current
