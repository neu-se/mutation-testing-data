Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly swaps the singular and plural forms, leading to the wrong output when 'criteria' is passed as input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an incorrect pluralization that does not follow the standard English rules for the word 'criterion', which should be 'criteria'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criteriae'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a non-standard plural form 'criteriae', which is not recognized in English, thus producing an incorrect output.

DONE.
