  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first one, whereas `arguments` would return an array containing all elements of `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first two, whereas `arguments` would return an array containing all elements of `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would return an array containing all elements of `arguments` except the first three, whereas `arguments` would return an array containing all elements of `arguments`.

DONE.
