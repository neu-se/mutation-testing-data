 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result, as the reciprocal of a number is its multiplicative inverse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the sine instead of the cosine, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the inverse cosine, which is not the same as the cosine. This would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
