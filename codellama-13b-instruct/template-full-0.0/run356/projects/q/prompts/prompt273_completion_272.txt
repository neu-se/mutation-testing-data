  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` object has a `value` property that is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` object has a `message` property that is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress.status
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` object has a `status` property that is not defined in the original code fragment.

DONE.
