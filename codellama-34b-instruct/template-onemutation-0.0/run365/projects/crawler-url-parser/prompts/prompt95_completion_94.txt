  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.url` is a string representing the URL of the base URL, while `baseUrlStr` is a string representing the URL of the current URL. Using `baseUrl.url` instead of `baseUrlStr` would cause the `parse` function to use the base URL as the current URL, which would result in incorrect parsing of the URL.
