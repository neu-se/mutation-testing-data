  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the first element in the `tokens` array, potentially causing the parser to miss a token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, potentially causing the parser to process tokens in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(tokens.length / 2); i < tokens.length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only process every other token in the array, potentially causing the parser to miss some tokens.

DONE.
