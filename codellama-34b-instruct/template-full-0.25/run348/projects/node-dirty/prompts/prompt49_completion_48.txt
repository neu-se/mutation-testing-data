  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with a different number of arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function is called with a different number of arguments, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
