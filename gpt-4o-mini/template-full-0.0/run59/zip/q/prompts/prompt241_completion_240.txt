Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nearerValue === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nearerValue` is an object instead of verifying if it is a promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of non-promise values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nearerValue` is an instance of an Array, which would incorrectly treat arrays as valid promise values, potentially leading to unexpected results in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nearerValue` is null or undefined, which would bypass the intended promise check and could lead to incorrect promise resolution logic.

DONE.
