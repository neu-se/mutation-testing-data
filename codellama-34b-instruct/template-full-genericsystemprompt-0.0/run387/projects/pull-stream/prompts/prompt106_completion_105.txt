  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `done` callback with no arguments, while this replacement calls it with a single argument `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `done` callback with no arguments, while this replacement calls it with a single argument that is an instance of the `Error` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `done` callback with no arguments, while this replacement calls it with a single argument that is `undefined`.

DONE.
