  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and the condition would check if i is less than or equal to the length of the lines array instead of less than. This would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
