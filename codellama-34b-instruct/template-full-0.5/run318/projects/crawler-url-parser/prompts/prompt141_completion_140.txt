  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the forward slash, resulting in a different URL being parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a URL fragment, which is not the same as the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a URL query string, which is not the same as the original URL.

DONE.
