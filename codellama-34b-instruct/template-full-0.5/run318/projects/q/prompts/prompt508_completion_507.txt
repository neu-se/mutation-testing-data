  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and using `call` instead of `apply` would cause the function to be called with a different context and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that is bound to a specific context and arguments, whereas `apply` and `call` call the function immediately with the specified context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, whereas `apply` and `call` call the function immediately with the specified context and arguments.

DONE.
