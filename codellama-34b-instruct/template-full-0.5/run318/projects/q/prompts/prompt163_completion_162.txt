  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace lines to be concatenated without any separation, making it difficult to identify the individual stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace lines to be concatenated with a tab character, which could make the stack trace harder to read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace lines to be concatenated with a backslash and the letter "n", which would not be a valid line break character.

DONE.
