  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is negated, which would cause the filter function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to only return true for even-indexed elements, which would cause the filter function to return a different subset of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index) || index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to return true for the first element of the array, regardless of whether it satisfies the original predicate function.

DONE.
