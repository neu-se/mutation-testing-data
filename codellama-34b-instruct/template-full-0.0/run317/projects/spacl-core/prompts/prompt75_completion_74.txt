  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is true, while this new code fragment checks if the result is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is true, while this new code fragment checks if the result is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is true, while this new code fragment checks if the result is false.

DONE.
