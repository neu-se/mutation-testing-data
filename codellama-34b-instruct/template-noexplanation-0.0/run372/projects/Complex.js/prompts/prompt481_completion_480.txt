  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['im'] === 0) {
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || this['im'] === 0) {
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['re'] === 0) {
```
This change will cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the real part of the complex number is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
