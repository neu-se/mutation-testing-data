  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing it to return a different value than it would have with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i + 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing it to return a different value than it would have with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i + 2) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the wrong arguments, potentially causing it to return a different value than it would have with the original code.

DONE.
