  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to access the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the code to access the previous element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the code to access the element at twice the index instead of the current one.

DONE.
