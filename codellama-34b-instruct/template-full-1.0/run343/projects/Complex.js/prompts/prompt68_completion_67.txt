  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(z);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the parsed result `z` to the `parser_exit` function, which would likely cause the function to exit with a different error message or behavior than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument `a` to the `parser_exit` function, which would likely cause the function to exit with a different error message or behavior than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to create a new instance of the `Complex` class, which may not be intended in this context.

DONE.
