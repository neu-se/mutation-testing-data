  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.delete` was originally a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `elem.delete` was originally a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `elem.delete` was originally an even number, and `false` if it was originally an odd number.

DONE.
