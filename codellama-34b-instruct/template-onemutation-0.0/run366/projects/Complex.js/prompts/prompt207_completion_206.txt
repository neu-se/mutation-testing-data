  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['im']` is greater than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `z['im']` is less than 0. This change would cause the function to return a different value when the input is a complex number with a negative imaginary part.

DONE.
