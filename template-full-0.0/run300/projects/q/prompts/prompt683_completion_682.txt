  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would create a rejected promise, causing the `dispatch` method to be called on a rejected promise, which would result in a different error message or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would create a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a resolved promise with a different value, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q({})` would create a resolved promise with the value `{}`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a resolved promise with a different value, which could result in different behavior.

DONE.
