  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, indicating that the database is loaded with one key-value pair, even if the database is actually empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `-1`, indicating that the database is loaded with a negative number of key-value pairs, which is not a valid state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `NaN`, which is not a valid number and would cause any code that relies on the `load` event to fail.

DONE.
