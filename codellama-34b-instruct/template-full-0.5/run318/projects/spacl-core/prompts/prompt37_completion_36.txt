  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts.push()` method is being called with a different argument, which would change the behavior of the `compile()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts.push()` method is being called with a different argument, which would change the behavior of the `compile()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
