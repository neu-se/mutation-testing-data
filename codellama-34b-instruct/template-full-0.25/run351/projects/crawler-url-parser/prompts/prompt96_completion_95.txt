  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is being modified by appending the string `'foo'`, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is being modified by replacing the string `'http://'` with `'https://'`, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is being modified by splitting it on the `'/'` character and returning the first element of the resulting array, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

DONE.
