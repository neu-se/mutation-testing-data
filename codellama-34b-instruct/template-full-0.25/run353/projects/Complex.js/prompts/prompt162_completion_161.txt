  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `Complex` object to `true`, which would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']` when the divisor is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `isInfinite` property of the `Complex` object to `false`, which would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['INFINITY']` when
