  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `nodeArgs` is a reference to the original array. If the function being tested modifies the array, the test would pass with the original code fragment but fail with the modified code fragment.

DONE.
