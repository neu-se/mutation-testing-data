  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push}[infinitely shifting array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6097204/adding-and-removing-from-array-at-the-same-position)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs` array to infinitely shift, resulting in the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function always being called with a different value, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to be called with an unexpected value, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to be called with an unexpected value, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
