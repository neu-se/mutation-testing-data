Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `isInfinite` method, as it would incorrectly assume that the complex number is not infinite regardless of its actual values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly evaluate the finiteness of the complex number by summing the real and imaginary parts, which could lead to a false positive for being finite when one of the parts is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part is infinite, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results for complex numbers that are infinite in the imaginary direction.

DONE.
