  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would no longer be called when an unhandled error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would be called with a different function, which may have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would throw the error, rather than attempting to handle it.

DONE.
