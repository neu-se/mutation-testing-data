  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(end)` would pass the `end` argument to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would pass `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(end)` would pass the `end` argument to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `cb(err, data)` would pass `err` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(end)` would pass the `end` argument to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment `cb(null, err)` would pass
