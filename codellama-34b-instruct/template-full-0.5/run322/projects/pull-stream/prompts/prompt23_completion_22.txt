  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument instead of the first argument to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument plus one to the `pull` function, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument multiplied by two to the `pull` function, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
