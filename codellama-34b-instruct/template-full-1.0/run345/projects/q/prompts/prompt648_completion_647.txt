  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the array `args`, which could cause unexpected behavior if the function expects a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the array `args`, which could cause unexpected behavior if the function expects a specific length or shape of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat("extra argument")]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the array `args`, which could cause unexpected behavior if the function expects a specific number of arguments.

DONE.
