  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the minimum length of the two iterators, rather than the length of the current operation in the other iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the maximum length of the two iterators, rather than the length of the current operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.abs(thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the absolute difference between the lengths of the two iterators, rather than the length of the current operation in the other iterator.

DONE.
