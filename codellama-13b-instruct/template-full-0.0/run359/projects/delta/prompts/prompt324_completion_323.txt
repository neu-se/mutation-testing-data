  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to skip over the first operation in the delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to skip over the last operation in the delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + Math.floor(length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to skip over half of the operations in the delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
