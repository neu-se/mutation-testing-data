  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called later, but calling `requestTick()` directly would cause `flush` to be called immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, which could cause the `flush` function to be called at a different time than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules the `flush` function to be called immediately, which could cause the `flush` function to be called at a different time than intended.

DONE.
