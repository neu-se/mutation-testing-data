  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("My custom error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a custom error message, whereas the original code fragment would reject with the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value passed in, whereas the original code fragment would reject with the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with the original exception, whereas the original code fragment would reject with a custom error message.

DONE.
