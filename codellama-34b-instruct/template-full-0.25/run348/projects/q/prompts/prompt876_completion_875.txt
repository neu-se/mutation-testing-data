  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.call(args)` will return a shallow copy of the `args` object, which is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` will return a shallow copy of the `args` object, which is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(args)` will return a shallow copy of the `args` object, which is not an array.

DONE.
