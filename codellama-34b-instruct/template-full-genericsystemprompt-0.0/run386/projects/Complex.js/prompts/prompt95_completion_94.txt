  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is not defined in the context of the code snippet, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant value, and would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment, which was `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"a"` is a string value, and would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment, which was `c`.

DONE.
