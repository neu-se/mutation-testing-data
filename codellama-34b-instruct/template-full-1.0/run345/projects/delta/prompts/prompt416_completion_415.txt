  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f() { return 2 + 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a closure that returned a constant value (4), while the new code fragment is a function that returns the result of a computation (2 + 2) every time it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not declare any variables, while the new code fragment declares a variable `x` with the value `5`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(1, -Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of a binary operation, while the new code fragment returns the result of a unary operation.

DONE.
