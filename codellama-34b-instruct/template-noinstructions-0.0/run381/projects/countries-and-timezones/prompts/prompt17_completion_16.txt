  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a string representing the country ID, while the new code fragment `"random"` is a string literal that does not represent any country ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a string representing the country ID, while the new code fragment `null` is a null value that does not represent any country ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a string representing the country ID, while the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value that does not represent any country ID.

DONE.
