  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment is more complex and includes a negative lookahead assertion, which is not present in the replacement code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment uses a different regular expression, which matches a different set of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '+')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment uses a different regular expression, which matches a different set of characters.

DONE.
