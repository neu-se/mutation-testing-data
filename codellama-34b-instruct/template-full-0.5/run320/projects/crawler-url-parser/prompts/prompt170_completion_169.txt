  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the hostname only, not the domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the domain only, not the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain == pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the subdomain only, not the domain.

DONE.
