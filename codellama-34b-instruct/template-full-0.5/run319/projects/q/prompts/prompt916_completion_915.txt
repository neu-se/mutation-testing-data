  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not reject the promise if the callback was undefined, while this new code fragment would reject the promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise if the callback was undefined, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not notify the promise with an error message if the callback was undefined, while this new code fragment would notify the promise with an error message.

DONE.
