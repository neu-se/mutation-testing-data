  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  nodeArgs.concat(array_slice(arguments, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is being concatenated twice, which could cause the application to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  nodeArgs.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is being concatenated with the `arguments` array starting from the second element, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  Array.prototype.slice.call(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is being converted to a regular array using the `Array.prototype.slice` method, which could cause the application to break if the `nodeArgs` array is used as an argument in a function call.

DONE.
