 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error or true value from the read callback to the last callback, while this change would always pass false to the last callback, potentially hiding errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls cb(ended) when the input data fails the test and ended is true, while this change would call cb(ended) unconditionally, potentially hiding errors or triggering premature termination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error or true value from the read callback to the last callback, while this change would discard the error or true value, potentially hiding errors.

DONE.
