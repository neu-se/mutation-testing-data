  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the data as is, while this mutation logs the data in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the data as is, while this mutation logs each character of the data separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the data as is, while this mutation logs the length of the data.

DONE.
