  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, whereas the `im` property is the imaginary part. Using `this['re'] * places` would result in a different value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a constant value to the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than multiplying it by a constant value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * (places + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by a different constant value, which would result in a different value for the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
