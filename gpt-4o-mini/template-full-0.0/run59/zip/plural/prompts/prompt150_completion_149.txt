Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.bind(null, this, num)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` to `null`, which may lead to unexpected results if the `plural` function relies on the context of the string being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.call(this, num)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `call` instead of directly invoking `plural`, which may not pass the string correctly as the first argument, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(this.toString(), num)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts `this` to a string explicitly, which could alter the input if `this` is not a string or if it has a different representation, leading to incorrect pluralization results.

DONE.
