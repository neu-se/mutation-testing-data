  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1(b)` is a function call, while `cosm1` is a variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1 + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1 + b` is an arithmetic expression, while `cosm1` is a variable name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1 * b` is an arithmetic expression, while `cosm1` is a variable name.

DONE.
