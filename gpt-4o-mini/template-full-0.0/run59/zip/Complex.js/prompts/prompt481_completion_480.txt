Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `true` for infinite values, leading to a false negative when checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part is NaN, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results for complex numbers that are NaN in the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic, causing the function to return `true` for finite numbers and `false` for infinite numbers, which is the opposite of the intended functionality.

DONE.
