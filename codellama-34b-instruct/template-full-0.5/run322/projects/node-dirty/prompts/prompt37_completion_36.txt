  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object that stores a list of callbacks for each key, while `this._data` is a Map object that stores the actual data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the Map, while `this._data` returns an iterator over the keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the Map, while `this._data` returns an iterator over the keys and values.

DONE.
