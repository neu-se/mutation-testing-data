  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `resolvedPromise` had a falsy value like `0` or `''`, since the equality operator would coerce the value to a Boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `resolvedPromise` had a falsy value like `0` or `''`, since `typeof` would always return `object` or `function` for objects and functions, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `resolvedPromise` was a truthy value, but `true` if it was a falsy value like `0` or `''`. The unary `!` operator coer
