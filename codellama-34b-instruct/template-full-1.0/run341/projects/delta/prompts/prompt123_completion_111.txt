  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would cause the loop to continue even when `index` is greater than `end`, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator would cause the loop to continue when `index` is equal to `end`, resulting in additional iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator would cause the loop to continue when `index` is greater than or equal to `end`, resulting in additional iterations.

DONE.
