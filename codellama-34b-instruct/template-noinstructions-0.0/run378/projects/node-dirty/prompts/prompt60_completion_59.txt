  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a writable stream, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream. Using `this._writeStream` instead of `this._readStream` would cause the code to write to the file instead of reading from it, which would likely cause errors and unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._readStream.destroy()` would destroy the readable stream, causing it to stop reading from the file. This would likely cause errors and unexpected behavior, especially if the code is relying on the readable stream to continue reading from the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.end()` would end the writable stream, causing it to stop writing to the file. This would likely cause errors and
