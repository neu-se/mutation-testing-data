  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-opLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` is replaced with `-opLength`, which would cause the loop to iterate a different number of times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` is replaced with `1`, which would cause the loop to only iterate once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `opLength` is replaced with `0`, which would cause the loop to not iterate at all.

DONE.
