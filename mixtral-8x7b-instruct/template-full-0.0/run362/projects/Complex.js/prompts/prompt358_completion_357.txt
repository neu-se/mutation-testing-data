 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument for the `cosh` function would be multiplied by 2, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because 1 would be added to the argument for the `cosh` function, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be replaced with the `cos` function, leading to different results.

DONE.
