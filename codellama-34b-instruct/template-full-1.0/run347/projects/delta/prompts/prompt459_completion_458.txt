  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.offset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the array starting from a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the array starting from a negative index.

DONE.
