  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the check for a negative sign, potentially causing the code to interpret a negative number as positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a positive sign instead of a negative sign, potentially causing the code to interpret a negative number as positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a multiplication sign instead of a negative sign, potentially causing the code to interpret a negative number as positive.

DONE.
