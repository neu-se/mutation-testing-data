  Sure, I can help you with that. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [null, null];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the values `null` and `null` to the variables `key` and `val`, respectively. The original code fragment, `const [key, val] = obj.a;`, assigns the values of the `a` property of the `obj` object to the variables `key` and `val`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = obj.a + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `1` to the values of the `a` property of the `obj` object and assign the result to the variables `key` and `val`. The original code fragment, `const [key, val] = obj.a;`, assigns
