  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of the `Op.length()` method, which could be any positive number, while the new code fragment always returns `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of the `Op.length()` method, which could be any positive number, while the new code fragment always returns `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of the `Op.length()` method, which could be any positive number, while the new code fragment always returns `0`.

DONE.
