  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This change will cause the `request` function to be called with the `options.url` object instead of the `options` object, which will likely result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest
```
This change will cause the `request` function to be called with the `options.dest` object instead of the `options` object, which will likely result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.pathname
```
This change will cause the `request` function to be called with the `options.url.pathname` object instead of the `options` object, which will likely result in a different behavior.

DONE.
