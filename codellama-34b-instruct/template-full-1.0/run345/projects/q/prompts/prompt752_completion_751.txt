  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Another error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message that is propagated to the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value that is propagated to the user when the rejection is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value that is propagated to the user when the rejection is handled.

DONE.
