  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first operation from the `other` delta onto the `delta` object, which is not the intended behavior of the `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the second operation from the `other` delta onto the `delta` object, which is not the intended behavior of the `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[2]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the third operation from the `other` delta onto the `delta` object, which is not the intended behavior of the `concat` method.

DONE.
