  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object` would test whether the variable `object` is falsy, which is not necessarily the same as testing whether it is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object !== 'object'` would test whether the variable `object` is not an object, but it would not test whether it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object || typeof object !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object || typeof object !== 'object'` would test whether the variable `object` is not an object or is falsy, which is not necessarily the same as testing whether it is not an object.

DONE.
