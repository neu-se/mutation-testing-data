  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && !end
```
This code fragment is logically equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) instead of the logical AND operator (`&&`). This change should not affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This code fragment is logically equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the logical OR operator (`||`) instead of the logical AND operator (`&&`). This change should not affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This code fragment is logically equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) instead of the logical OR operator (`||`). This change should not affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
