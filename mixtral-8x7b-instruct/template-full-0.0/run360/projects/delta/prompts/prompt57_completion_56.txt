 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops !== undefined && Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `undefined` instead of `null`. The original code handles both `null` and `undefined` cases, while this change would incorrectly assume that `ops` is always defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ops && ops.ops instanceof Array
