  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the first operation in the `delta` object with the newly created operation `newOp`, rather than the last operation as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the second-to-last operation in the `delta` object with the newly created operation `newOp`, rather than the last operation as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing `undefined` with the newly created operation `newOp`, rather than a valid operation as intended.

DONE.
