  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().state` would always return a string, causing the program to always enter the `if` block and throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().value` would always return the current value of the promise, which could be any type of object. If the value is not a function, the program would always enter the `if` block and throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect().reason` would always return the current rejection reason of the promise, which could be any type of object. If the reason is not a function, the program would always enter the `if` block and throw an exception.

DONE.
