  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, 10)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only report the first 10 characters of the corrupted row, rather than the entire row.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would report the corrupted row in uppercase letters, rather than the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would report the corrupted row in reverse order, rather than the original order.

DONE.
