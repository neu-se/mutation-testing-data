  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is a boolean variable that is set to `true` when the `requestTick` function is called, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the `requestTick` function is only called when `!flushing` is true, which means that the function is only called when the `flushing` variable is false. If we replace the `!flushing` with `flushing`, the function will be called when the `flushing` variable is true, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!flushing && true` is always `false` when `flushing` is `true`, and `true` otherwise. In the original code, the `requestTick` function is only called when `!flushing` is true, which means that the function is only called when the `flushing` variable is false. If we replace
