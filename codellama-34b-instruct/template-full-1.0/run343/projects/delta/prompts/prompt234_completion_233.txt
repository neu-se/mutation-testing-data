  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` will remove the given number of characters from the `ops` array, while `push` would add a new operation to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` would add a new operation to the array with the given length, while `push` would add the given operation as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` would add a new operation to the array with the given length and a null `insert` value, while `push` would add the given operation as is.

DONE.
