  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of JSON.stringify() is the "space" argument, which specifies the number of spaces to indent the JSON output. In the original code, this argument is set to the value of the "spaces" parameter, which defaults to 0 if not specified. If we replace the PLACEHOLDER with "obj, null, 0", the output of JSON.stringify() will be indented with a single space, which may affect the appearance of the JSON output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null, Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of JSON.stringify() is the "space" argument, which specifies the number of spaces to indent the JSON output. In this case, setting the "space" argument to Infinity would result in an infinite loop, as JSON.stringify() would continue to indent the JSON output indefinitely. This would likely cause a crash or infinite loop in the program.
