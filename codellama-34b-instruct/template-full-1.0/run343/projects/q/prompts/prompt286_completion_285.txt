  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks whether `resolver` is not equal to the string `"function"` instead of checking whether it is not a function. This would cause the code to always enter the `try` block and call `resolver`, even if `resolver` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolver !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks whether `resolver` is not an object instead of checking whether it is a function. This would cause the code to always enter the `try` block and call `resolver`, even if `resolver` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.constructor.name !== "Function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks whether the `constructor` property of `resolver` is not the `Function` constructor function instead of checking whether `resolver` is
