 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the approximate reciprocal of the radians-to-degrees conversion, instead of the actual conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(1) * 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a simplified approximation for the value of Ï€, which is less accurate than the built-in `Math.PI`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(x) => 180 * x / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function that returns the incorrect value, instead of the correct `rad2deg` function.

DONE.
