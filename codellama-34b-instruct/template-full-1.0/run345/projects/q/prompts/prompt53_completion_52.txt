  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the code as running in a NodeJS environment, regardless of whether it actually is or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "number";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, as `process` is an object and cannot be a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() === "[object number]";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, as `process.toString()` returns a string in the form "[object process]".

DONE.
