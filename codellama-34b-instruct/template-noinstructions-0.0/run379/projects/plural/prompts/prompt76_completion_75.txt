  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die" as "dice", while the new code fragment would return the singular form of the word "die" as "die".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die" as "dice", while the new code fragment would return the plural form of the word "die" as "dies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'died'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die" as "dice", while the new code fragment would return the past tense form of the word "die" as "died".
