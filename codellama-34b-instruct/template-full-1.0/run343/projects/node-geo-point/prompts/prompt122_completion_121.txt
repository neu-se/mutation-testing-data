  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `calculateBearing` method is called on a null object, it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because if a GeoPoint object with coordinates (0, 0) is used instead of the original object, the function call would return a different value, as the calculation would be performed using the (0, 0) coordinates instead of the original coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be performed using the sum of the longitude and latitude coordinates, which would return a different value than the original calculation.

DONE.
