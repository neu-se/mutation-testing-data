  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `task` to be a function, but `null` is not a function and will cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `task` to be a function, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `task` to be a function, but `() => {}` is a no-op function and will not cause any errors, but it will also not execute any code.

DONE.
