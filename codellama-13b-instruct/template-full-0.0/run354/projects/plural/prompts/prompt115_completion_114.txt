  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "illnesses", while the modified code fragment returns the length of the array "illnesses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "illnesses", while the modified code fragment returns the first element of the array "illnesses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.join(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "illnesses", while the modified code fragment returns a string containing the elements of the array "illnesses" separated by commas.

DONE.
