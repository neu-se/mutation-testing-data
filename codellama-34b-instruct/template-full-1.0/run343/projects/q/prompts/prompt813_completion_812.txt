  I will be happy to help! Here are three answers as you requested.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function(){return void 0;}```
This would result in different behavior because this function returns undefined, whereas the original code fragment returns the "this" context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function(arg){return arg + 1;}```
This would result in different behavior because this function adds one to the argument, whereas the original code fragment returns the "this" context as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function(arg){return arg * 2;}```
This would result in different behavior because this function multiplies the argument by two, whereas the original code fragment returns the "this" context as-is.

DONE.
