 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver()()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()()` immediately invokes the returned function, which is not the intended behavior in the original code. The original code only needs to pass the function as a callback, without invoking it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
