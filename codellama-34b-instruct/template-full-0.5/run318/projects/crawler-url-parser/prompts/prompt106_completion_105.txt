  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds a new element to the map, while `set` is a method that sets the value of an element in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` removes an element from the map, while `set` sets the value of an element in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` removes all elements from the map, while `set` sets the value of an element in the map.

DONE.
