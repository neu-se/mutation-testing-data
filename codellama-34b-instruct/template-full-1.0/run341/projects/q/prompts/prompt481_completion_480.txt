  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, which could cause the unhandled rejection tracking to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra element to the `unhandledReasons` array, which could cause the unhandled rejection tracking to report more unhandled rejections than the actual number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the index of the element to be removed with the length of the `unhandledReasons` array, which would cause the function to always remove the last element of the array, regardless of the actual index of the element to be removed.

DONE.
