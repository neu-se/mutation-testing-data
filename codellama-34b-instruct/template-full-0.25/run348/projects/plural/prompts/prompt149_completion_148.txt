  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `plural` method from the `String.prototype` object, causing the `plural` function to be undefined and unable to be called on strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { return this; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `plural` method with a new function that simply returns the original string, effectively making the `plural` function a no-op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { throw new Error('Plural method not implemented'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `plural` method with a new function that throws an error when called, causing any code that relies on the `plural` method to fail.

DONE.
