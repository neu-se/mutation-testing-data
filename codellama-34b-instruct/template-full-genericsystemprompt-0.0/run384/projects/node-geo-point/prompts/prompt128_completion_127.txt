  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the longitude of the current point and the longitude of the destination point, instead of the distance between the current point and the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the longitude of the current point and the latitude of the destination point, instead of the distance between the current point and the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the latitude of the current point and the longitude of the destination point, instead of the distance between the current point and the destination point.

DONE.
