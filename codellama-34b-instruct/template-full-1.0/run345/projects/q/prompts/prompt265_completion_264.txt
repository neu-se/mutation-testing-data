  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would short-circuit the call to `fulfill`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would short-circuit the call to `fulfill`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `fulfill` with a string value, which would be different from the original behavior where `value` could be any value.

DONE.
