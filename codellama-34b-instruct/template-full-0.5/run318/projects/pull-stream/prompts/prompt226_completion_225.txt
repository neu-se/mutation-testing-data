  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is being used, which will return the opposite of the result of the `test(data)` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is not being used, so the result of the `test(data)` function will be returned directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) ? true : false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `? :` operator is being used to explicitly return `true` or `false` based on the result of the `test(data)` function.

DONE.
