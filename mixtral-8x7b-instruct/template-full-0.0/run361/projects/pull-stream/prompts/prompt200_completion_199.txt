 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` callback would not be set when the `map` function is still busy processing a previous item, causing the next item to be processed regardless of whether an abort signal has been received.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` callback would be set to `null` when the `map` function is still busy processing a previous item, causing a TypeError to be thrown when the `abortCb` is called during the processing of the next item.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` does not refer to a valid callback function, causing a TypeError to be thrown when the `abortCb` is called during the processing of the next item.

DONE.
