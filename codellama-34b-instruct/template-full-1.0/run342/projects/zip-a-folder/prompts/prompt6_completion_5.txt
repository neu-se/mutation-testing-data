  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `targetFilePath` argument is not passed as a named argument, but as a positional argument, which would result in the function throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value `1` is not a valid path, so the function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would wait indefinitely for the `undefined` promise to resolve, which would never happen.

DONE.
