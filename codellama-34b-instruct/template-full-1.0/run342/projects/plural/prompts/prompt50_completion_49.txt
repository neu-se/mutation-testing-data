  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]ar $/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end in "ar" instead of "o".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o{3,}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end in "o" three or more times instead of just once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end in "o" regardless of the number of times it appears.

DONE.
