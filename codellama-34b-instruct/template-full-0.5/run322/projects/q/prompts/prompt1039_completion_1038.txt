  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was resolving the `closed` deferred object with the `error` object, while the new code would resolve it with the `error` object and then throw the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was resolving the `closed` deferred object with the `error` object, while the new code would reject the `closed` deferred object with the `error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was resolving the `closed` deferred object with the `error` object, while the new code would notify the `closed` deferred object with the `error` object.

DONE.
