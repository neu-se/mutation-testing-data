  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `op` method on the `descriptor` object without passing any arguments, which could produce a different result if the method has side effects or relies on the values of any global variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as an argument to the `op` method, which could affect the result of the method if it relies on the values of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(descriptor)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `op` method to the `descriptor` object and then call it without passing any arguments, which could affect the result of the method if it relies on the values of `this` or the arguments passed to it.

DONE.
