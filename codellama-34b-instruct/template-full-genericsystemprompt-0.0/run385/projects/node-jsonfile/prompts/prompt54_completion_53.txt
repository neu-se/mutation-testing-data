  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return a string with no spaces, whereas the original code fragment would return a string with spaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return a string with no spaces, whereas the original code fragment would return a string with spaces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return a string with no spaces, whereas the original code fragment would return a string with spaces.

DONE.
