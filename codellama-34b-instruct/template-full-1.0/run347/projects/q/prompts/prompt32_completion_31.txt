  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a null value as the task would cause the runSingle function to be called with a null task, which would likely result in an error or undefined behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the noop function as the task would cause the runSingle function to be called with a function that does nothing, which would likely result in the task being skipped or ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(laterQueue[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the first element of the laterQueue array as the task would cause the runSingle function to be called with a task that may not be the one that is intended to be executed, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
