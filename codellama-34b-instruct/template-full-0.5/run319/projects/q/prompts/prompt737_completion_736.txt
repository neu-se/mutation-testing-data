  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an array cannot be less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would only consider the first promise in the array, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function would consider all promises in the array, rather than just the first one.

DONE.
