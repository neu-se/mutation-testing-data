  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent()` function to decode the basename, while this new code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the basename to uppercase. This change would result in a different value being used for the `dest` option, which could potentially cause the `request()` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.basename()` function to get the basename of the `options.dest` path, while this new code fragment uses the `path.basename()` function to get the basename of the `options.url` path. This change would result in a different value being used for the `dest` option, which could potentially cause the `request()` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
