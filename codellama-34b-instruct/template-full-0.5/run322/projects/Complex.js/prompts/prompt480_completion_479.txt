  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isNaN` and would return a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator and would invert the result of `isNaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different method than `isNaN` and would return a different result for the same input.

DONE.
