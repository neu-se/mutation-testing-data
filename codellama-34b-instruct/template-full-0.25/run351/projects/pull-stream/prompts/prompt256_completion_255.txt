  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code. The original code is expecting a function to be assigned to `_read`, not a stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.pipe(values)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the result of piping the `stream` through the `values` function to `_read`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code. The original code is expecting a function to be assigned to `_read`, not a stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream.pipe(once)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the result of piping the `stream` through the `once` function to `_read`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code. The original code is expecting a function to be assigned to `_read`,
