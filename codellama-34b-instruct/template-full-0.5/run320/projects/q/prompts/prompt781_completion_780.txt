  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless()
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `promise.inspect()`, but in the original code, the function is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return promise.inspect(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not called in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not called in the original code.

DONE.
