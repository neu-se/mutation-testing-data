  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to skip the first operation in the `other` delta and concatenate the remaining operations instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[other.ops.length - 1]
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to concatenate the last operation in the `other` delta instead of the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * other.ops.length)]
```
This change will cause the `concat` method to concatenate a random operation from the `other` delta instead of the first operation.

DONE.
