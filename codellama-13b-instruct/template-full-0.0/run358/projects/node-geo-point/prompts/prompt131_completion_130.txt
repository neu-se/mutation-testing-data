  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` variable is being incremented by 1, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom` variable is being decremented by 1, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a different tile coordinate.

DONE.
