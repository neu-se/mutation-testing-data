 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an incorrect number of arguments, causing unexpected behavior or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects a nullish value (null or undefined) as the `this` argument, but passing `null` explicitly might cause issues if the function relies on the default behavior with the global object as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be passed as the `thisp` argument, which might cause issues if the function being bound relies on a specific `this` value.

DONE.
