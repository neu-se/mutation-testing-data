  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while the modified code calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere with a 180 degree offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while the modified code calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere with a 2x offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while the modified code calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere with a -180 degree offset.

DONE.
