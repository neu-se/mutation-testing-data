  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first character of the base URL string, which may not be a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the base URL string to lowercase, which may not be a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/\/$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the trailing slash from the base URL string, which may not be a valid URL.

DONE.
