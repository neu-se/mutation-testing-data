  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is different from `<`, which could lead to a different outcome in the `for` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is different from `<`, which could lead to a different outcome in the `for` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` could potentially cause the loop to iterate more times than intended, leading to different behavior in the loop.

DONE.
