  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and is not NaN, while the buggy code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and is not NaN, but also checks if the next token is not a space. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases where the next token is a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1]) && tokens[i + 1] !== 'i'
