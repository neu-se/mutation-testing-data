  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason, " "
```
This would result in a syntax error, so it would cause the modified code to not compile or run at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would cause the concatenation operator to return NaN instead of a string, which would likely cause an unhandled rejection to be reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would cause the concatenation operator to return null instead of a string, which could cause an unhandled rejection to be reported.

DONE.
