  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array, while the original code simply checks if `unhandledRejections` is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof unhandledRejections === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `unhandledRejections` is an object, while the original code simply checks if it's a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `unhandledRejections` is defined, while the original code simply checks if it's a falsy value.

DONE.
