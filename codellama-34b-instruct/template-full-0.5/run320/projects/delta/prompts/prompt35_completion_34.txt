  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is undefined. These are not the same thing, and the new code fragment may produce different results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is falsy. These are not the same thing, and the new code fragment may produce different results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to itself. This is a contradiction and will always evaluate to `false`, which may produce different results in some cases.

DONE.
