  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the path of the current file, whereas `__dirname` returns the path of the current file's directory. Using `__filename` would cause the `path.resolve()` method to resolve the path relative to the current file, rather than the current file's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd()` returns the current working directory, whereas `__dirname` returns the path of the current file's directory. Using `process.cwd()` would cause the `path.resolve()` method to resolve the path relative to the current working directory, rather than the current file's directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the parent directory of the specified path, whereas `__dirname` returns the path of the current file
