  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` always returns a boolean value, whereas `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength + 1` would increment the length of the next operation in the iteration, whereas `otherIter.peekLength` returns the length as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength - 1` would decrement the length of the next operation in the iteration, whereas `otherIter.peekLength` returns the length as is.

DONE.
