  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `a && onEnd` is always false, so the `else` branch will never be executed, even if `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `a || onEnd` is always true, so the `if` branch will always be executed, even if `end` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a && !onEnd` is always false, so the `else` branch will never be executed, even if `end` is true.

DONE.
