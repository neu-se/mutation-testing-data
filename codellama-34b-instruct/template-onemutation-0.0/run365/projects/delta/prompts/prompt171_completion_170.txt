  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest. In the context of the code, this would cause the `length` variable to be assigned the largest value between the two operands, rather than the smallest.
