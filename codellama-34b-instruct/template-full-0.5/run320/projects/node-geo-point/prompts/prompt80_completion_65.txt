  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + deg2rad(coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is applied to the `coordinate.longitude` value, which is not the same as the `λ1` value used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI / 2` value is added to the `λ1` value, which is not the same as the `deg2rad` function applied to the `coordinate.longitude` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + Math.PI * coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI * coordinate.longitude` value is added to the `λ1` value, which is not the same as the `deg2rad` function applied to the `coordinate.longitude` value.
