  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with a rejected promise, which would cause the `array_reduce` function to be called with `undefined` as its first argument, instead of the expected `resolvedPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with a fulfilled promise, which would cause the `array_reduce` function to be called with the fulfilled value as its first argument, instead of the expected `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with a notification promise, which would cause the `array_reduce` function to be called with the notification
