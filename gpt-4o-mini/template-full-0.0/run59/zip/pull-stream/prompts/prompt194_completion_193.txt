Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would signal a successful completion with a `null` error instead of passing the `aborted` error, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass a string 'error' as the error argument, regardless of the actual abort reason, which could mislead the caller about the nature of the failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `end` variable (which is expected to be a termination signal) instead of the `aborted` error, potentially causing the caller to misinterpret the state of the operation.

DONE.
