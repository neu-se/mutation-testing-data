  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property is a string representing the path of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object representing the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` property is a string representing the entire URL, while `linkurl` is an object representing the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is a string representing the protocol of the URL, while `linkurl` is an object representing the entire URL.

DONE.
