  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfill function is changed to reject, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the become function is called with the rejected promise, causing the promise to be rejected with the value as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with undefined instead of the value.

DONE.
