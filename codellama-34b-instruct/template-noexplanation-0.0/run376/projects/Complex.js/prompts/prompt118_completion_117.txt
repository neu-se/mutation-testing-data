  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `sign` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `sign` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This change will also cause the `sign` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `sign` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `sign` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `sign` method.

DONE.
