 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` invokes the function with a given `this` value and arguments as an array. This change could cause issues if the `arguments` passed to the function rely on the array-like behavior of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.apply` is a method that provides the ability to apply a target function to a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, similar to the original `apply`. However, using `Reflect.apply` introduces a potential difference in behavior due to its additional features, such as handling of `this` binding and argument spreading.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because
