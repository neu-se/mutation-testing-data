  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function has a different range of values than `sinh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function has a different range of values than `sinh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coth` function has a different range of values than `sinh`.

DONE.
