  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to `pull` instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument would be incremented before being passed to `pull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument would be passed to `pull` instead of the second argument.

DONE.
