  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```
    const other = new Delta({ ops: [ 
        {retain: 1 }, 
        {insert: 't'}, 
        {delete: 1 }, 
        {insert: 'h'}, 
        {retain: 2 }, 
        {delete: 1 }]});
```
This would result in different behavior because the the new 'Delta' instance created by this code fragment has an extra 'insert' operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```
    const other = new Delta({ ops: [ 
        {retain: 1 }, 
        {insert: 't'}, 
        {delete: 1 }, 
        {insert: 'h'}, 
        {retain: 2 }, 
        {delete: 1 }]});
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'insert' operation on line 2 of the code fragment was modified to insert the character 'h' instead of the character 'a'.
