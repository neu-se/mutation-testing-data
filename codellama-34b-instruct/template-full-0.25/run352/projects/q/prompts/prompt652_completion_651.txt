  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the second argument instead of the third, which would cause the `name` argument to be included in the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would start from the third argument instead of the second, which would cause the `name` argument to be excluded from the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would only take the second argument and ignore the rest, which would cause the `name` argument to be included in the `args` array.

DONE.
