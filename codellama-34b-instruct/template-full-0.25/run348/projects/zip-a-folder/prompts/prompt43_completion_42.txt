  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `glob` module to match files, while the new code fragment is using the `split` method to split the `globPart` string into an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '**')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `glob` module to match files, while the new code fragment is using the `replace` method to replace the `*` character with `**`, which would match all files and subdirectories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `glob` module to match files, while the new code fragment is using the `replace` method to replace the `*` character with an empty string, which would match all files and subdirectories.
