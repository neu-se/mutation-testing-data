 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(promises) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's internal `[[Class]]` property instead of the `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the object's constructor instead of the `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is an actual array, but it won't work in older browsers that don't support `Array.isArray()`.

DONE.
