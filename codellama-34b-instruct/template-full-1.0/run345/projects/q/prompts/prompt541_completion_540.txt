  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which is the value `void` returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new promise that is resolved, while `void 0` is a undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fulfill()` creates a new promise that is fulfilled, while `void 0` is a undefined value.

DONE.
