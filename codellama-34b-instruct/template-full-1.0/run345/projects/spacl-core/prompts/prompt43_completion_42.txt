  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with a different parameter, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with a different parameter, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.flatten()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called on the superclass instead of the current class, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
