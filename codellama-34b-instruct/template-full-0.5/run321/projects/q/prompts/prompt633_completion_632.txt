  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would delete the `key` property from the object, while the new code fragment would set the `key` property to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would delete the `key` property from the object, while the new code fragment would retrieve the value of the `key` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hasOwnProperty", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would delete the `key` property from the object, while the new code fragment would check if the `key` property exists in the object.

DONE.
