  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to use the synchronous `fs.readFileSync` method instead of the asynchronous `fs.readFile` method. This could potentially cause issues with the `universalify.fromCallback` function's ability to handle asynchronous operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to use the `fs.readFile` method bound to the `fs` object, which could potentially cause issues with the `universalify.fromCallback` function's ability to handle asynchronous operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null)
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback` function to use the `fs.readFile` method bound to `null`, which could potentially cause issues with the `universalify
