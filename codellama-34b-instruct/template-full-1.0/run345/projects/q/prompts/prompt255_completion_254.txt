  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    newPromise, message, message
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, which could cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    newPromise, message, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because a `undefined` argument is being passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, which could cause a different branch of the code to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    newPromise, message, 'different'
```
This would result in different behavior because a different value is being passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, which could cause a different branch of the code to be executed.

DONE.
