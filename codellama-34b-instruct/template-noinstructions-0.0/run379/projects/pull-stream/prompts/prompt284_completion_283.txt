  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would propagate the error to the next step in the pipeline, while the new code fragment `null` would swallow the error and continue the pipeline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would propagate the error to the next step in the pipeline, while the new code fragment `undefined` would not propagate the error and would continue the pipeline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would propagate the error to the next step in the pipeline, while the new code fragment `throw err` would throw the error and stop the pipeline.

DONE.
