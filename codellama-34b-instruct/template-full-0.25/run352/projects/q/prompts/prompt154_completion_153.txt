  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:" + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:" + "\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be different.

DONE.
