  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, meaning that it will return `true` if `deprecated` is not strictly equal to `true`. In the original code, the `===` operator is used, which checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `deprecated`, meaning that if `deprecated` is `true`, it will return `false`, and if `deprecated` is `false`, it will return `true`. In the original code, the `===` operator is used, which checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for loose equality, meaning that it will return `true` if `deprecated` is lo
