 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `inspect` function from the global object, which might not have the desired effect if there is a global `inspect` function defined elsewhere in the codebase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['inspect']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation to access the `inspect` property, which might not work as expected if the `inspect` property is not a direct property of the `object` but rather inherited from its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `inspect` function from the `Object.prototype`, which might not have the desired effect if there is a different `inspect` function defined in the prototype chain of the `object`.

DONE.
