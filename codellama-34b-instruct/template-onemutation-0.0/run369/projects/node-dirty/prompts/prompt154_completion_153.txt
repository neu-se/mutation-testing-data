  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function as an argument to `uncork`, while the new code fragment passes `null`. This would cause the `uncork` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.
