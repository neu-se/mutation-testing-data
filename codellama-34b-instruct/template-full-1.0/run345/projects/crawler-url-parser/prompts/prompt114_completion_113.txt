  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior as it would get the key-value pairs of the map instead of just the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.reversed()
```
This would result in different behavior as it would iterate the map in a reverse order.

DONE.
