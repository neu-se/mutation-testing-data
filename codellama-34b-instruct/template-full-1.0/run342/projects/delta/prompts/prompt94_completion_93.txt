  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to insert the value `123` into the `ops` array, instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to insert the value `null` into the `ops` array, instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to insert the value `newOp + 1` into the `ops` array, instead of the expected value.

DONE.
