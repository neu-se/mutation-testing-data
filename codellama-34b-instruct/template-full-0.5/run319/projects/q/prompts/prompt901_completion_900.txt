  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is used to resolve the promise, whereas the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is used to notify the promise of a progress update, whereas the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` method is used to create a new node resolver, whereas the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise.

DONE.
