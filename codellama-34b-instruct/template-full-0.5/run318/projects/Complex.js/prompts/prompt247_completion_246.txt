  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` and `this['im']` refer to different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a)` and `this['im']` are different functions with different return values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` and `this['im']` are different functions with different return values.

DONE.
