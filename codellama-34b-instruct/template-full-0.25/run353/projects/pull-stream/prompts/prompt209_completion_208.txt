  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` is true, the new code fragment would evaluate to false, and if `aborted` is false, the new code fragment would evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `aborted` is not strictly equal to true, the new code fragment would evaluate to false, and if `aborted` is strictly equal to true, the new code fragment would evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `aborted` is not strictly equal to false, the new code fragment would evaluate to true, and if `aborted` is strictly equal to false, the new
