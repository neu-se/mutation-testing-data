 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the length of the other iterator as larger, causing the diff algorithm to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the length of the other iterator as smaller, causing the diff algorithm to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the length to a string, causing issues when comparing lengths and iterating through the operations.

DONE.
