  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while the new code fragment uses the first element of the `arguments` object, which may not be the same as the `thisp` argument.
