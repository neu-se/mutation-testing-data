  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is not. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the first character of the word, while the new code fragment is checking the second character. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the word in its original form, while the new code fragment is checking the word in its reverse form. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

DONE.
