  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nothing;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` loop would not be executed if the `if` statement's condition evaluates to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `next()` method, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for the `next()` method, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
