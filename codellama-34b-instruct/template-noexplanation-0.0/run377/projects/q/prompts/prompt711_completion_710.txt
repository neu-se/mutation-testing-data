  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This change will cause the `Q.keys` method to return the values of the object's properties, rather than the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This change will cause the `Q.keys` method to return the length of the object, rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This change will cause the `Q.keys` method to return the string representation of the object, rather than the keys.

DONE.
