  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$r
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a variable, and `r` is uncertain in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$$.arg
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a variable, and `$$` is uncertain in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$$arg
```
 This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a variable, and `$$` is uncertain in this context.

DONE.
