  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement code fragment checks if it is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement code fragment checks if it is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement code fragment checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
