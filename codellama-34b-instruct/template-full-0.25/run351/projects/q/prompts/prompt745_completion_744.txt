  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a different function than `onRejected`, and it would be called when the promise is fulfilled instead of when it is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a different function than `onRejected`, and it would be called when the promise makes progress instead of when it is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and it would cause an error when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
