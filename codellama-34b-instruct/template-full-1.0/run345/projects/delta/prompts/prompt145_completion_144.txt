  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.pop()` would remove the last element from the `ops` array, whereas `ops.push()` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the `ops` array, whereas `ops.push()` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.shift()` would remove the first element from the `ops` array, whereas `ops.push()` would add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
