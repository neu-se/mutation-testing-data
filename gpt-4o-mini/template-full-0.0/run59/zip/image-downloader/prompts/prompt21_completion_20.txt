Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `url` property is absolute instead of the `dest` property, which could lead to incorrect handling of the destination path if the URL is not absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the `dest` path, which would cause the path resolution to fail or lead to an incorrect destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, 'dummy')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if a path created by joining `dest` with a dummy string is absolute, which would always return false if `dest` is not an absolute path, leading to unintended resolution of the destination.

DONE.
