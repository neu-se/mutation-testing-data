  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` would cause the function to execute immediately and not wait for the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[]` would cause the function to execute immediately with an empty array and not wait for the promise to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() => {}` would cause the function to execute immediately without any arguments and not wait for the promise to resolve.

DONE.
