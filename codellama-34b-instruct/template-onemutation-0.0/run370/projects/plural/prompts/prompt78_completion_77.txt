  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was adding a rule for the word "goose" to be pluralized as "geese", but the new code fragment is adding a rule for the word "goose" to be pluralized as "gooses".

DONE.
