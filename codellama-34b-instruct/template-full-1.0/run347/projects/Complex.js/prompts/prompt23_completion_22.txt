  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less-than operator, which checks if the value of `a` is less than the value of `b`. However, the new code fragment uses the identity operator, which checks if the value of `a` is identical to the value of `b`. If `a` and `b` are equal, the identity operator will return `true`, while the less-than operator would have returned `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less-than operator, which checks if the value of `a` is less than the value of `b`. However, the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator, which checks if `a` and `b` are both truthy. If either `a` or `b` is falsy, the logical AND operator will return `false`, while the less-than operator would have returned `true`.

Option 3
