  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp.retain) {
    const newOp: Op = {};
    if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number') {
        newOp.retain = {""}
} 
```
This would result in different behavior because the tested code would no longer check if `otherOp.retain` is a number, resulting in different execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp.retain) {
    const newOp: Op = {};
    if (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number') {
        newOp.retain = document.cookie
} }
```
This would result in different behavior because the tested code would now add a string representing a cookie to the `retain` property of `newOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp.retain) {
    const newOp: Op = {};
    if (typeof thisOp.retain === '
