  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob(src)` returns `true` if `src` is a glob, whereas `!isGlob(src)` returns `true` if `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const isGlob = (src) => !src.includes('*');
```
This would result in different behavior because the new implementation of `isGlob` would return `true` if `src` does not contain a `*` character, whereas the original implementation would return `true` if `src` is a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const isGlob = (src) => src instanceof RegExp;
```
This would result in different behavior because the new implementation of `isGlob` would return `true` if `src` is an instance of `RegExp`, whereas the original implementation would return `true` if `src` is a
