  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function using the `Math.exp` method, but then subtract 1 from the result, which would not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a + i*b, 2) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of the complex number using the `Math.pow` method, but then subtract 1 from the result, which would not be the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - Math.exp(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function using the `Math.exp` method, but then subtract the exponential function evaluated at 1 from the result, which would not be the same as the original code fragment
