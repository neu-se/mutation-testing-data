  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude instead of the latitude to calculate the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the latitude before calculating the tile coordinates, which would cause the resulting tile coordinates to be offset by half a tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 180 degrees from the latitude before calculating the tile coordinates, which would cause the resulting tile coordinates to be offset by half a tile in the opposite direction.

DONE.
