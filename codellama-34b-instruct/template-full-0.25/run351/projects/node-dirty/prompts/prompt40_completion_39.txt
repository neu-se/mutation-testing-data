  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` and `val` variables are not defined in the code snippet provided, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when added together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` and `val` variables are not defined in the code snippet provided, so it would throw a `ReferenceError` when multiplied together.

DONE.
