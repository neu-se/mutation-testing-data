  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the `args` object to `errback`, instead of the `errback` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"errback"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the string `"errback"` instead of the actual `errback` function, which would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the result of the `Math.max()` function (which would likely be a numerical value) instead of the actual `callback` or `errback` functions, which would likely cause a runtime error.

DONE.
