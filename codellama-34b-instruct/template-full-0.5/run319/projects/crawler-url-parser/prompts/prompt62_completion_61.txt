  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is a string representing the path of the URL, whereas `parsedUrl` is an object containing various properties of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the host and pathname properties of the URL, whereas the original code only used the `pathname` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname.replace(/^\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the leading slash from the pathname, whereas the original code kept it.

DONE.
