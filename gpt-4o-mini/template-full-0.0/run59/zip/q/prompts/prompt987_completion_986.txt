Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument ("extraArg") to the array, which may cause the target method to behave differently or throw an error if it does not expect more arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, which could lead to the method being called with the wrong parameters, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs.length, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the actual arguments with the length of the `nodeArgs` array and the method name, which would not provide the expected arguments to the method, likely resulting in a failure or incorrect execution.

DONE.
