  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the original order of the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the original length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the original elements in the array.

DONE.
