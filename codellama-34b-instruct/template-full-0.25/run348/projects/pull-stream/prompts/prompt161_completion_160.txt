  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` if `value` is not null, but this modified code fragment would call `cb` regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the value of `value` to a new variable `_value` before calling `cb`, but this modified code fragment would pass the original `value` to `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value of `_value` to `cb`, but this modified code fragment would pass `null` to `cb`.

DONE.
