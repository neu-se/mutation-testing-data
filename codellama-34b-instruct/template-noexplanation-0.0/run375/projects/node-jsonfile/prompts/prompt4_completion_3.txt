  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function to return `null` instead of the expected `options` object. This will likely cause the `JSON.parse` function to throw an error, which will be caught by the `try-catch` block and returned as `null` if the `shouldThrow` option is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function to return an empty object instead of the expected `options` object. This will likely cause the `JSON.parse` function to throw an error, which will be caught by the `try-catch` block and returned as `null` if the `shouldThrow` option is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` function
