  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `length` is falsy, while this replacement code fragment uses the `===` operator to check if `length` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `length` is falsy, while this replacement code fragment uses the `<` operator to check if `length` is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to check if `length` is falsy, while this replacement code fragment uses the `!==` operator to check if `length` is not equal to `Infinity`.

DONE.
