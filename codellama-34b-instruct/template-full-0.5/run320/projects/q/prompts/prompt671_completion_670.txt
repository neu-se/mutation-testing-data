  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.slice(1)` would result in the second argument being an array with the first element removed, which would cause the `fapply` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.concat(["extra"])` would result in the second argument being an array with an extra element, which would cause the `fapply` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })` would result in the second argument being an array with each element incremented
