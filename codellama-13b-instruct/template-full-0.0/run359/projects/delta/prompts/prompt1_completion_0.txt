  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would return `undefined` if `a` is `null`, whereas the original code would return an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would return `undefined` if `a` is `undefined`, whereas the original code would return an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would return `undefined` if `a` is `undefined`, whereas the original code would return an empty object.

DONE.
