  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function resolve(promise){ return promise; }
```
This would result in all promises return without inspecting, as the resolve function returns the input promise directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function reject(error){ return error; }
```
This would result in all promises return immediately when rejected, as the reject function returns the input error directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function immediate(value){ return value; }
```
This would result in all promises return immediately when fulfilled or rejected, as the immediate function returns the input value directly.

DONE.
