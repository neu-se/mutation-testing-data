  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the dot product of the two vectors, while this replacement code fragment calculates the dot product directly using the `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad) * cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the dot product of the two vectors using the `sin` function, while this replacement code fragment calculates the dot product using the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad) * cos(point2Rad) * cos(a)

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the dot product of the two vectors using the `sin` function, while this replacement code fragment calculates the dot product using the `cos` function and
