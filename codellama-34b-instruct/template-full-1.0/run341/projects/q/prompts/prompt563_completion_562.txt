  Option 1: The
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original
code, the `Throw` case returns a rejected promise with the error.
If it is replaced with `null`, the rejected promise will be caught
by the `when` statement, and the `null` value will be passed to the
next `handler`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original
code, the `Throw` case returns a rejected promise with an undefined
error. If it is replaced with `undefined`, the rejected promise will
be caught by the `when` statement, and the `done` method will be
called with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original
code, the `Throw` case returns a rejected promise with a value. If it
is replaced with `Q()`, the rejected promise will be caught by the
`when`
