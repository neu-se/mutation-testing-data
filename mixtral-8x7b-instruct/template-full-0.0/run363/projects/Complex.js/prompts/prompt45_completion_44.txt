 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `parse` function to always treat the input as a string, even if it is a number or an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to throw a `TypeError` when `a` is not `null`, `undefined`, a number, or an object with the correct properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow objects that were created using the `new Object()` constructor or object literals (`{}`) to be parsed correctly. Other types of objects, such as arrays or functions, would not be parsed correctly.

DONE.
