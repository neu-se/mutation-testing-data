  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a` instead of multiplying it by `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the value of `a` by `b` instead of multiplying them.

DONE.
