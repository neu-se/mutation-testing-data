  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + length
```
This would result in different behavior because `start` and `length` are different variables, and `start + length` would produce a different result than `start`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - length
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` and `length` are different variables, and `end - length` would produce a different result than `start`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `start`, and would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
