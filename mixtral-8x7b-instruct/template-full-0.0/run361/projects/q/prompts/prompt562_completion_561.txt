 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Replaced by mutation testing')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would catch the `StopIteration` exception and return the value, while the mutated code would throw an error and not return the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a rejected promise with the `StopIteration` exception, while the mutated code would return a resolved promise with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a rejected promise with the `StopIteration` exception, while the mutated code would return the `Q` object itself, which is not a promise and would likely cause errors in the calling code.

DONE.
