  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Object.keys` to get an array of property names of the `array` object, whereas `array.length - 1` would return the length of the array minus 1, which could result in different behavior if the array has fewer than two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Object.keys` to get an array of property names of the `array` object, whereas `array.values()` would return an array of property values of the `array` object, which could result in different behavior if the array contains objects with different properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Object.keys` to get an array of property names of the `array` object, whereas `array.slice
