  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `length` property of the `line` variable, which is a `Delta` object, to determine the length of the line. Replacing the `length` property with 0 would cause the `while` loop to execute indefinitely, as the `line` variable would never become empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `length` property of the `line` variable, which is a `Delta` object, to determine the length of the line. Replacing the `length` property with -1 would cause the `while` loop to execute indefinitely, as the `line` variable would never become empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `length
