  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified exception, rather than resolving it with the value returned by `thenResolve`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined`, rather than the value returned by `thenResolve`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the value returned by `resolve`, rather than the value returned by `thenResolve`.

DONE.
