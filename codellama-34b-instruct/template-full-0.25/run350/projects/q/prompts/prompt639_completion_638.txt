  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property to `undefined` instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the property value instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would post a message with the property value set to `undefined` instead of deleting it.

DONE.
