  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause an error when trying to call `pull.apply(undefined, ref)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and would not have a `source` property, which is used in the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() {}` is a function that does not have a `source` property, which is used in the `if` statement.

DONE.
