Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to call `nextChunk` immediately after setting `_read`, potentially leading to an infinite loop if the stream is not properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the data to the callback, which may not be the intended behavior when processing the next chunk of data, potentially leading to unexpected results in the consuming code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `true` as an argument to `nextChunk`, which is not expected by the function and could lead to incorrect handling of the stream data or errors in the processing logic.

DONE.
