  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would return `null` instead of a deferred object, and the promise returned by `Q` would be forever pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would return an empty object instead of a deferred object, and the promise returned by `Q` would be forever pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would return a reference to the `Q` constructor itself, instead of a deferred object, and the promise returned by `Q` would be forever pending.

DONE.
