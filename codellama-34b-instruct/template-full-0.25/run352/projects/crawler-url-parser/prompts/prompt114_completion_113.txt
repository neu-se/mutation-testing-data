  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, value] of urlMap.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the `urlMap` object, rather than just the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const value of urlMap.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `urlMap` object, but would not provide access to the corresponding keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, value] of urlMap.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the `urlMap` object, but would not provide access to the corresponding values.

DONE.
