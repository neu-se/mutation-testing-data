  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `a` instead of `b`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the `key` property of `b` instead of the value of `b`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `undefined` instead of `b`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

DONE.
