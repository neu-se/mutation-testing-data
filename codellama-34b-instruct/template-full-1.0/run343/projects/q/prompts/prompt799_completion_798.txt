  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is not defined in the scope of the function, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` expects an object with an `index` and a `value` property, but an empty object does not have those properties. It would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` expects an object with an `index` and a `value` property, but a string does not have those properties. It would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
