  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"add"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a verb that indicates a message is being sent, while `add` is an arithmetic operation that has a different purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"multiply"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a verb that indicates a message is being sent, while `multiply` is an arithmetic operation that has a different purpose.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a verb that indicates a message is being sent, while `get` is a function that retrieves a property of an object.

DONE.
