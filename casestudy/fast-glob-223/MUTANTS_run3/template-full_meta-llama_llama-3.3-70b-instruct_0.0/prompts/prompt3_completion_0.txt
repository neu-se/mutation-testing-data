Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
micromatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `micromatch` is an object with various methods, including `makeRe` and `isMatch`, whereas `isGlob` is a function that checks if a string is a glob pattern, so using `micromatch` directly would likely cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => true
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement would always return `true`, indicating that every pattern is dynamic, whereas `isGlob` checks if a string is a glob pattern and returns a boolean value accordingly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pattern => pattern.includes(ESCAPE_SYMBOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement checks if the pattern includes the escape symbol, whereas `isGlob` checks if the string is a glob pattern, which may not necessarily include the escape symbol, so the replacement would have a different condition for determining if a pattern is dynamic.

DONE.
