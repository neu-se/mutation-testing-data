 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
-y, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the y component is flipped, which would affect the calculation of the new longitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
y, 1 / x
```
This would result in different behavior because the x component is inverted, which would affect the calculation of the new longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.sin(y), Math.cos(x)
