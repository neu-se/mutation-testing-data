  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.square
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.square()` returns the square of its argument, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp()` returns the exponential of its argument, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log()` returns the logarithm of its argument, while `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of its argument.

DONE.
