  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `err` variable, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `err` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is falsy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `err` is falsy.

DONE.
