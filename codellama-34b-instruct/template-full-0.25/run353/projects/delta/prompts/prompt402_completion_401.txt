  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the embed type in the `Object.keys()` array would be different, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the embed type would no longer match the key in the `otherData` object, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the embed type would no longer match the key in the `otherData` object, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

DONE.
