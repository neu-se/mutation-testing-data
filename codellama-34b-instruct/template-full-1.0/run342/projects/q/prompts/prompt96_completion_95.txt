  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index <= length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "<" operator, which would evaluate to false if index was greater than or equal to length. In this alternative code fragment, we use the "<=" operator, which would evaluate to true if index was greater than or equal to length, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index >= length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "<" operator, which would evaluate to true if index was greater than or equal to length. In this alternative code fragment, we use the ">=" operator, which would evaluate to false if index was greater than or equal to length, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index === length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "<" operator, which would evaluate to true if index was equal to length
