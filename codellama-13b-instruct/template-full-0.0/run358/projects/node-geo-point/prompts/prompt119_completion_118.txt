  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the bearing value would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by a small amount in the opposite direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the bearing value would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by a small amount in the same direction as the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of the bearing value by 2 would cause the calculated destination point to be shifted by a larger amount in the same direction as the bearing.

DONE.
