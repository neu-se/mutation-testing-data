  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is called with the `object` argument, which is a promise, and returns a promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is called with the `object` argument, which is a promise, and returns a promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` function is called with the `object` argument, which is a promise, and returns a promise that resolves to the same value as the original promise.

DONE.
