  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment uses the `of` operator to iterate over the `Map` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator of only the keys in the `Map` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `of` operator to iterate over both the keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator of only the values in the `Map` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `of` operator to iterate over both the keys and values.
