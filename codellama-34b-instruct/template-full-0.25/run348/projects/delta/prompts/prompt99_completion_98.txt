  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter would be incremented by 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `splice` method to start at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp.insert` property would be used as the second argument to `splice` instead of `newOp`, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp.attributes` property would be used as the third argument to `splice` instead of `newOp`, which would cause the `splice` method to insert the wrong value.

DONE.
