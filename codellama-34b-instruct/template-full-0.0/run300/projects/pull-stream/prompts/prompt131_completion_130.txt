  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max--
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would decrement `max` instead of incrementing `i`, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would set `i` to `max` instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
