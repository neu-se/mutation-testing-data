  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong number of arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `dispatch` method, causing an error.

DONE.
