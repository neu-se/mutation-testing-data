  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `defer`, but `defer(null)` would pass `null` instead. This could cause an error or unexpected behavior when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `defer`, but `defer(1)` would pass the number `1` instead. This could cause an error or unexpected behavior when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed to `defer`, but `defer(function() {})` would pass an anonymous function that does nothing instead. This could cause an error or unexpected behavior when the function is called.

DONE.
