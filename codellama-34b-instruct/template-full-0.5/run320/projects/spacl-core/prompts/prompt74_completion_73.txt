  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the function would return `false` instead of `null` if the rule's query returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the function would return `false` instead of `null` if the rule's query returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, so the function would return `true` instead of `null` if the rule's query returns `true`.

DONE.
