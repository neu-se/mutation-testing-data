  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the divisor, while the mutated code fragment uses `a + 1` as the divisor, which would change the result of the division.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b / d` as the divisor, while the mutated code fragment uses `b / a` as the divisor, which would change the result of the division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the divisor, while the mutated code fragment uses `a + b` as the divisor, which would change the result of the division.

DONE.
