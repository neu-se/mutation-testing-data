  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with an error event, which would trigger the error handling logic in the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', () => this.emit('drain'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with a `'drain'` event, which would trigger the `drain` event handler in the `Dirty` class. However, the event handler would also call `emit` again, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', () => this.emit('drain', () => this.emit('drain')));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with a `'drain'`
