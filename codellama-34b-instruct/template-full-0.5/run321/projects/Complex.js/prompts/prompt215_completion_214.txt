  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `,` operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand, whereas the new code fragment uses the `+` operator, which returns the sum of the two operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `,` operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand, whereas the new code fragment uses the `*` operator, which returns the product of the two operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `,` operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand, whereas the new code fragment uses the `-` operator, which returns the difference of the two operands.

DONE.
