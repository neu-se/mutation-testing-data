  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is being called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is being called with the return value of `otherIter.next()`, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherIter.next() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is being called with a different argument, which could cause the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
