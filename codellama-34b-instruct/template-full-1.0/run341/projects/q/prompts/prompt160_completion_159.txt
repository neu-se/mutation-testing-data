  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: "modified stack", configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be modified with the string "modified stack", which would not capture the correct call stack.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: stack.replace("original", "modified"), configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be modified with the string "modified stack", which would not capture the correct call stack.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: null, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be null, which would not capture the correct call stack.

DONE.
