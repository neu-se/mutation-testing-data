  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging the elements of two arrays, while `push` method adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.unshift(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging the elements of two arrays, while `unshift` method adds new elements to the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice(0, 0, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` method creates a new array by merging the elements of two arrays, while `splice` method adds new elements to the specified position in an array.

DONE.
