  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value associated with the key, rather than the value associated with the placeholder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, rather than the value associated with the placeholder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, rather than the value associated with the placeholder.

DONE.
