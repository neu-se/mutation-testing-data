  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would mutate the `base` array instead of returning a new array with the same elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the same elements as `base`, but with a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the same elements as `base`, but with a different order.

DONE.
