  Definitely! Here are the options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with the `exception` object itself instead of its `message` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with a non-null value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with a random number, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

DONE.
