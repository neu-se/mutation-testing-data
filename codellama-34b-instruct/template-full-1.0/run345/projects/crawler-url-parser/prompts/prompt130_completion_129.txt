Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl` is used as the base URL to resolve other URLs, and an empty object will not have any properties to use as the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com/"
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl` is used to determine the type of link (internal, external, etc.), and a different URL will have a different type.

BONUS: Here's a riddle: What is the role of the `retsArr` variable in the code?

1. It stores the extracted URLs from the HTML
2. It stores the URLs that should be ignored
3. It stores the type of link (internal
