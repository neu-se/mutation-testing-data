Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string and if `op.attributes` is not null, which would cause the code to skip the logic for retaining operations that are actually numbers with null attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is strictly undefined, which would bypass the logic for retaining operations that have a numeric value, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.attributes` is not strictly undefined instead of checking for null, which could lead to different outcomes if `op.attributes` is an empty object or another falsy value.

DONE.
