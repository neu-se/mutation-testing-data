  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z` variable is defined as a new instance of the `Complex` class, and would not have the same properties or methods as the original `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the `Complex` class, and would not have the same properties or methods as the original `b` variable.

DONE.
