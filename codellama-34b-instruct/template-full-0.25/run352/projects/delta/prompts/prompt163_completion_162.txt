  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance one step further than it should, potentially skipping over an important operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to rewind one step, potentially repeating an operation that was already performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance twice as far as it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
