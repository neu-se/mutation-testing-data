  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two numbers, while `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - index` would give the number of characters until the end of the string, while `Math.min` would give the smaller of the two numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because `index + length` would give the number of characters after the end of the string, while `Math.min` would give the smaller of the two numbers.

DONE.
