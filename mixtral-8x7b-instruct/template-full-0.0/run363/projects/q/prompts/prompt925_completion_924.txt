 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` directly applies the function with an array of arguments, while the original code uses `this.fapply` which maintains the context of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` wraps the value in a promise, whereas the original code returns the promise directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.prototype.then.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype.then.call` directly invokes the `then` method of the promise prototype, while the original code uses `this.then` which maintains the context of the promise.

DONE.
