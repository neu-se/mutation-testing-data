  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would receive a `null` value instead of an array-like object, and would return an empty array instead of an array containing the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would receive an empty array instead of an array-like object, and would return an empty array instead of an array containing the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` would receive an object instead of an array-like object, and would return an array containing the object's properties instead of an array containing the arguments.

DONE.
