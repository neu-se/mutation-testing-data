  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function checks for equality, and the `!` operator negates the result, so the code would behave differently if the `insert` properties of the two objects were not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, and the code would behave differently if the `insert` properties of the two objects were not strictly equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert !== otherOp.insert || thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would also check for inequality in the `attributes` properties of the two objects, and the code would behave differently if either the `insert` or `attributes` properties were not equal.

DONE.
