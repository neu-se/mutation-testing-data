  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is defined and has a length of at least 3, while this code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr.slice(0, -1)` is defined and has a length of at least 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is defined and has a length of at least 3, while this code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr.substring(0, 1)` is defined and has a length of at least 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.indexOf('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is defined and has a length of at least 3, while this
