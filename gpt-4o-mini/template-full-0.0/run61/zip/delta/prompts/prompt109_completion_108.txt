Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it will push operations to the `passed` array only if the operation is falsy, which is the opposite of the original intent where it checks if the operation passes the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will push operations to the `passed` array only if the operation has a length greater than zero, potentially excluding valid operations that do not meet this condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only push operations to the `passed` array if they have an `insert` property that is not null, ignoring operations that may be valid but do not have an `insert` property.

DONE.
