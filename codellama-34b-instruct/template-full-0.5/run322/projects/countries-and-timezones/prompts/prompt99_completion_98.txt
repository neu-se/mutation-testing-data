  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns the values of the own enumerable string-keyed properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns the own enumerable string-keyed property names of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable and non-enumerable string-keyed property names, while `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumer
