  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the new op only if the condition is met, whereas this code would always push the new op regardless of the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `push` to add the new op to the end of the `ops` array, whereas this code uses `splice` to insert the new op at a specific index, which could potentially change the order of the ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = this.ops.concat(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code modifies the `ops` array in place, whereas this code creates a new array that is a concatenation of the original `ops` array and the new `newOp` object.
