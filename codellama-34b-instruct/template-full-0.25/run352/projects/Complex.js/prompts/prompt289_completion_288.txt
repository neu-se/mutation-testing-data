  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be offset by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to `sinh` would be different.

DONE.
