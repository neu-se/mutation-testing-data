  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise object, while the modified code fragment returns the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `then` method to chain promises, while the modified code fragment uses the `fapply` method to chain promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `then` method to chain promises, while the modified code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to chain promises.

DONE.
