Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called on the string representation of the object instead of the object itself, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called on the global `window` object instead of the `obj` object, which would likely lead to incorrect results and potentially cause errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `hasOwnProperty` on `null` would throw a TypeError, whereas calling it on `obj` would not, assuming `obj` is a valid object.

DONE.
