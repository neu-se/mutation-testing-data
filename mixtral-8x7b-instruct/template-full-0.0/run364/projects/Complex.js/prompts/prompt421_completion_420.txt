 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always return `false`, causing the `inverse` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for all cases, even when the number is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isZero` method on the `this` object, which might not be equivalent to checking if the denominator is zero. This could lead to incorrect results or exceptions when the `this` object does not have an `isZero` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, causing the `inverse` method to return a complex number with a real part of `0` and an imaginary part of `0` (`Complex['ZERO']`), even when the number is not
