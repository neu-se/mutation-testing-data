  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first element of the coordinates array, rather than all the elements, which could cause errors if the coordinates array contains more than one element.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the number of elements in the coordinates array, rather than the values of those elements, which could cause errors if the coordinates array contains unexpected values.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the coordinates array, which could cause errors if the order of the elements is important.

DONE.
