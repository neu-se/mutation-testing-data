 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call `nextStream()` instead of calling `nextChunk()` when there's no abort condition and `_read` is defined. This change would cause the function to not propagate errors correctly from the current stream to the caller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite recursion when calling `nextChunk()`, since it would keep calling the same function without ever reaching the base case. This change would cause the function to crash with a stack overflow error.
