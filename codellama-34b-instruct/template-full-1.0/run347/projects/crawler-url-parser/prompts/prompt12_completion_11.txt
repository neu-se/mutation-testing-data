  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `https://` protocol would be used instead of `http://`, which could cause issues with certain URLs that do not support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'file://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file://` protocol would be used instead of `http://`, which could cause issues with file URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://www.');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `www.` subdomain would be added to the URL, which could change the behavior of the URL parsing and normalization.

DONE.
