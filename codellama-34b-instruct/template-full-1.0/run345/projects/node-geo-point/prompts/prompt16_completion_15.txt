  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLatLngArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to call the `fromLatLngArray` method instead of the `fromLngLatArray` method, which could lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromGeJSON
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to call itself instead of the `fromLngLatArray` method, which could lead to an infinite loop and crash the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to return `null` instead of a `GeoPoint` object, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
