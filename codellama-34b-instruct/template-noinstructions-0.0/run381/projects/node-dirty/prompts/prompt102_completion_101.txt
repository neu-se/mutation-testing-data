  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete()` removes only the element with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with an undefined value would set the value for the specified key to undefined, while `delete()` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with a null value would set the value for the specified key to null, while `delete()` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

DONE.
