  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a different value than `options`, which could cause the `stringify` function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a different value than `options`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a different value than `options`, which could cause the `JSON.parse` function to produce a different output.

DONE.
