Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra length to the value returned by `peekLength`, potentially causing the index to be incremented incorrectly when processing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts one from the length, which could lead to incorrect calculations of the index when encountering 'delete' or 'insert' operations, potentially skipping over some operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length returned by `peekLength`, which would cause the index to move forward too far, potentially leading to incorrect transformations or missed operations.

DONE.
