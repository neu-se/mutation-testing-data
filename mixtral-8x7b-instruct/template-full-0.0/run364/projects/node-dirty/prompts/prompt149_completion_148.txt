 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb = cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only assigns the first callback in the `cbs` array to `cb`, while the original code fragment uses a `for...of` loop to iterate over all callbacks in the array. This change may cause some callbacks not to be executed, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the last callback in the `cbs` array, while the original code fragment uses a `for...of` loop to iterate over all callbacks in the array. This change may cause some callbacks not to be executed, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes and returns the first callback in the `cbs` array, while
