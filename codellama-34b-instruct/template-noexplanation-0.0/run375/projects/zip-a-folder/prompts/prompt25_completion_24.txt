  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This code fragment will set the `gzip` option to `true` if it is not already set in the `archiverOptions` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This code fragment will set the `zlib` option to an object with a `level` property set to `9` if it is not already set in the `archiverOptions` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This code fragment will set the `store` option to `true` if it is not already set in the `archiverOptions` object.

DONE.
