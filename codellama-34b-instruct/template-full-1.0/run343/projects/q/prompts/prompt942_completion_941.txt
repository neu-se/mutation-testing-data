  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].join()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` returns an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function. On the other hand, `[].join()` creates a new array and joins its elements into a string when `.join()` is called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` returns an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function. On the other hand, `[].concat()` creates a new array and concatenates its elements when `.concat()` is called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"".split()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` returns an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function. On the other hand, `"".split()` creates a new array by splitting an empty string, which would result in an array that contains no elements when `.split()` is called on
