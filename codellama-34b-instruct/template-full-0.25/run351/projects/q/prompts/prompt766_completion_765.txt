  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `noop`, which means it does nothing and does not throw any errors. However, the new code fragment throws an error with a message that includes the rejection message, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `noop`, which means it does nothing and does not return any value. However, the new code fragment returns a rejected promise with the rejection reason, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior
