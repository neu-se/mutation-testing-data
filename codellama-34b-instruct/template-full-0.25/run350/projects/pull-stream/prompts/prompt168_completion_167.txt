  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment simply passed the function as an argument to `abortCb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with `null` as the `this` context, whereas the original code fragment did not specify a `this` context for the `onAbort` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.apply(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with `null` as the `this` context and an empty argument list, whereas the original code fragment did not specify a `this` context for the `onAbort`
