  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `cb` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => { throw new Error('Error in callback function'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, while the modified code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => { console.log('Callback function called'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not log a message to the console, while the modified code fragment does.

DONE.
