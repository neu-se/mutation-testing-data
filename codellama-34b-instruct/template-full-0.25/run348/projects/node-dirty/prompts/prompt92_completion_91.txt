  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + buffer)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different and include the buffer variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + rowStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different and include the rowStr variable.

DONE.
