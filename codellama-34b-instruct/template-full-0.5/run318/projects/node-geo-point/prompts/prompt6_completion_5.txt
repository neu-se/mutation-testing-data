  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is an object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the `isObject` function to return `false`, even if the input is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is an object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `isObject` function to return `false`, even if the input is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the input is an object, but replacing it with an empty array would cause the `isObject` function to return `true`, even if the input is not an object.

DONE.
