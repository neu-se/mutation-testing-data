  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `iter.hasNext()`, causing the loop to terminate early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would short-circuit the loop, causing it to terminate early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the loop to continue indefinitely, regardless of the value of `iter.hasNext()`.

DONE.
