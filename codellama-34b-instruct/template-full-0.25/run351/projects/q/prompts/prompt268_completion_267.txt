  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Error` object with the `reason` message, whereas the original code simply passed the `reason` value as the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason + "");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `reason` value to a string using the `+ ""` operator, whereas the original code simply passed the `reason` value as the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `message` property of the `reason` object as the rejection reason, whereas the original code simply passed the `reason` value as the rejection reason.

DONE.
