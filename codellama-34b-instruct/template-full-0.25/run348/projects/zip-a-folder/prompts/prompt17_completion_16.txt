  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the targetBasePath, which would change the path that is being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the targetBasePath to uppercase, which could change the path that is being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/').reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the path components, which could change the path that is being accessed.

DONE.
