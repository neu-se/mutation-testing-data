  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to check if `options.reviver` is defined, while the new code fragment does not. If `options.reviver` is not defined, the original code fragment would return `null`, while the new code fragment would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to check if `options.reviver` is defined, while the new code fragment always returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to check if `options.reviver` is defined, while the new code fragment always returns `data`.
