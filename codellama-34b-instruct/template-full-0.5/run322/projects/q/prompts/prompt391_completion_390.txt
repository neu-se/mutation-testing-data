  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would not be called, which could cause the progress propagator not to be attached in the current tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with `undefined` as the value, which could cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with a no-op function as the value, which could cause the progress propagator to not be attached in the current tick.

DONE.
