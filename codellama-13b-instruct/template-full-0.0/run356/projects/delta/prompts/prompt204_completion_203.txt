  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops` array is being used instead of the `rest` function, which would cause the code to return the entire `this.ops` array instead of the remaining ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops` array is being used instead of the `rest` function, which would cause the code to return the entire `other.ops` array instead of the remaining ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delta.ops` array is being used instead of the `rest` function, which would cause the code to return the entire `delta.ops` array instead of the remaining ops.

DONE.
