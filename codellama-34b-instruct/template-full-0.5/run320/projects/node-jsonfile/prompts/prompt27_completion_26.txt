  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `random()` function would introduce a random value into the JSON parsing process, which could cause the parsing to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `options.reviver` value, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, 'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'hello'` would be added to the `options.reviver` value, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
