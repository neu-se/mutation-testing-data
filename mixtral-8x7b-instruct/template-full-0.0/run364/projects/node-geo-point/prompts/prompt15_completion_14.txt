 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>point).coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses type checking and allows any property to be accessed, potentially causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point['coordinates']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation instead of dot notation, which might not be caught by the current test suite if it only checks for the correct property name using dot notation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `coordinates` array. If the original code modifies the array, this change would not reflect those modifications, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the methods that rely on the original array.

DONE.
