  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` argument is being passed to the `cb` function instead of the `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is being passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is being passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
