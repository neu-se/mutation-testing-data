  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(object, name, args).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.ninvoke` is a method that returns a promise, but it is not being used to reject the promise in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(object, name, args).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.ninvoke` is a method that returns a promise, but it is not being used to resolve or reject the promise in this case.

DONE.
