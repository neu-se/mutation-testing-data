  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is not called, which could cause the promise to be resolved without handling progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is not called, which could cause the promise to be resolved without handling progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is not called, which could cause the promise to be resolved without handling progress notifications.

DONE.
