Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, insert: null };
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `insert` property of `newOp` to `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the `insert` operation is processed, potentially causing errors or incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, delete: 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `delete` property with a value of `1` to `newOp`, which could change the intended operation from an insert to a delete, leading to incorrect manipulation of the operations array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp = { ...newOp, retain: newOp.retain + 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `retain` property of `newOp` by incrementing it by `1`, which could alter the intended length of the retention operation, potentially causing logical errors in the operation sequence.

DONE.
