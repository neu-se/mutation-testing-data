  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!object.hasOwnProperty('type') || !object.hasOwnProperty('coordinates'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the presence of two properties, 'type' and 'coordinates', in the object instead of just 'type' as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type') || !Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the presence of the properties 'type' and 'coordinates' in the object's prototype chain instead of just the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the presence of both properties 'type' and 'coordinates'
