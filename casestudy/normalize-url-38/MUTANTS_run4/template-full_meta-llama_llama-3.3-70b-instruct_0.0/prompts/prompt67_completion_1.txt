Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if a string includes a specified value, whereas the original code uses a regular expression to match the hostname against a specific pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method checks if a string starts with a specified value, whereas the original code uses a regular expression to match the hostname against a specific pattern, allowing for more flexibility in the hostname format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname ===
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for an exact match between the hostname and the string 'www.', whereas the original code uses a regular expression to match the hostname against a specific pattern, allowing for more flexibility in the hostname format.

DONE.
