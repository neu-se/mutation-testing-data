  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.call` is a different method than `continuer.bind`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.apply` is a different method than `continuer.bind`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null)` would bind the function to a different context, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
