  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.push(null)` would add `null` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment `nodeArgs` would add the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.pop()` would remove the last element from the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment `nodeArgs` would add the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.shift()` would remove the first element from the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment `nodeArgs` would add the value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to the
