Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.remoteAddress
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed two arguments to the `trust` function, but this replacement passes only one argument, potentially changing the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.remoteAddress, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `0` as the second argument to the `trust` function, but this replacement passes `1`, which could affect the function's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.connection.localAddress, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment referred to `remoteAddress`, but this replacement refers to `localAddress`, which is a different property of the `connection` object and could return a different value.

DONE.
