  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of the original value, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of the original value, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `0` instead of the original value, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
