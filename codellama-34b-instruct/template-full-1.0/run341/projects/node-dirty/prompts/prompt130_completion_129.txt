  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let key, val;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `key` and `val` variables with `undefined`, which would cause the loop to run forever.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let key = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `key` variable to `null`, which would cause the loop to run forever.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let key = "abc";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `key` variable to a non-empty string, which would cause the loop to run forever.

DONE.
