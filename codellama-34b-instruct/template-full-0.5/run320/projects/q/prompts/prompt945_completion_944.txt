  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the arguments to be passed to the callback in a different order, potentially causing the callback to fail or return unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the arguments to be passed to the callback in a different order, potentially causing the callback to fail or return unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would empty the `nodeArgs` array, causing the callback to receive no arguments. This would likely cause the callback to fail or return unexpected results.

DONE.
