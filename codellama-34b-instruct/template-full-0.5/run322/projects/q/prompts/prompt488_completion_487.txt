  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called twice, which would reset the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays to empty, even if there were unhandled rejections that had not been reported yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag would be set to `false`, which would prevent any further unhandled rejections from being tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would be cleared, even if there were unhandled rejections that had not been reported yet.

DONE.
