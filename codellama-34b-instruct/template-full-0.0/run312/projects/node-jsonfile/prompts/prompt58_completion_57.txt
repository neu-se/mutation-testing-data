  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` variable, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` variable, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses a backslash followed by the letter "n", which is a string literal representing a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\r\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `EOL` variable, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses a backslash followed by the letter "r" followed by a backslash followed by the letter "n", which is a string literal representing a carriage return followed by a newline character.

DONE.
