  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args = array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `args.concat` to concatenate the `args` from the outer function with the `array_slice` from the inner function, while this replacement would simply reassign `args` to a new array without concatenating anything.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice` to create a new array from the `args` from the inner function, while this replacement would simply create a shallow copy of the `args` array using the `slice()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `array_slice` to create a new array from the `args` from the inner function, while this replacement would create a new array by mapping each element
