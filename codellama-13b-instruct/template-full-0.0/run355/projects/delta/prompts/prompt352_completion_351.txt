  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is comparing the `attributes` property of two `Op` objects, while the buggy code fragment is comparing the `attributes` property of an `Op` object with the `attributes` property of a `Delta` object. This would result in a type error and the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is comparing the `attributes` property of two `Op` objects, while the buggy code fragment is comparing the `attributes` property of an `Op` object with the `insert` property of a `Delta` object. This would result in a type error and the code would not compile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is comparing the `attributes
