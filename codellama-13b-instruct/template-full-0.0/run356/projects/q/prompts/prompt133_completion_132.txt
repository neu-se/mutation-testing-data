  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for `null`, whereas the original code would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for `undefined`, whereas the original code would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would return `false` for the number `1`, whereas the original code would return `true`.

DONE.
