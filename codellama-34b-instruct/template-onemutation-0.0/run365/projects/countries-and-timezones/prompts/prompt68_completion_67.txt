  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country === null` checks if the `country` variable is strictly equal to `null`. If the `country` variable is `undefined`, `!country` would return `true`, while `country === null` would return `false`.
