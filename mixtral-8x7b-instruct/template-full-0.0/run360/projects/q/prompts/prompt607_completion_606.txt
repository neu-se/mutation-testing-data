 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `op` variable may contain a truthy value, causing the `promiseDispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'op'
