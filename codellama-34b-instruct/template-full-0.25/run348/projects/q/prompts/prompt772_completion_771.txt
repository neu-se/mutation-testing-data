  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.filter(function (promise) {
    return promise.isRejected();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `all` to wait for all promises to be settled, while this code fragment uses `filter` to only wait for rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.map(function (promise) {
    return promise.isFulfilled();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `all` to wait for all promises to be settled, while this code fragment uses `map` to only wait for fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.reduce(function (prev, current) {
    return prev.isRejected() || current.isRejected();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `all` to wait for all promises to be settled, while
