  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This will cause the `tan` function to return the wrong value, as it will be using the cosine function instead of the sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This will cause the `tan` function to return the wrong value, as it will be using the hyperbolic sine function instead of the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This will cause the `tan` function to return the wrong value, as it will be using the inverse sine function instead of the sine function.

DONE.
