 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. In this context, using `filter` would not create a proper copy of the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value. In this context, using `reduce` would not create a proper copy of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object. In this context, using `slice` would not create a proper copy
