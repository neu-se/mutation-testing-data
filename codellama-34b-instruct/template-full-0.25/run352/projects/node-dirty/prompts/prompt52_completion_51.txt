  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always use the current value of the key, rather than the value of the key at the time the `update` method was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always use the current value of the key plus one, rather than the value of the key at the time the `update` method was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `update` method to always use the current value of the key multiplied by two, rather than the value of the key at the time the `update` method was called.

DONE.
