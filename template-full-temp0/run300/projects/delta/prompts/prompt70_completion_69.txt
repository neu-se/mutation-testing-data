  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while this new code checks if it has more than one key. This could cause the `retain` method to behave differently if the `attributes` object has only one key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `attributes` object has at least one key, while this new code checks if it has no keys. This could cause the `retain` method to behave differently if the `attributes` object has no keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes
