  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. If the `onEnd` function is called with `undefined` as the argument, it will not execute the `drain` function and the `done` callback will not be called, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. If the `onEnd` function is called with an empty string as the argument, it will not execute the `drain` function and the `done` callback will not be called, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. If the `onEnd` function is
