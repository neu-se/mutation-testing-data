  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would create a rejected promise, whereas `Q(object)` would create a resolved promise with the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would create a rejected promise, whereas `Q(object)` would create a resolved promise with the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q({})` would create a resolved promise with the value of `{}`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a resolved promise with the value of `object`.

DONE.
