  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a reserved word in JavaScript and refers to the function `Promise.all()`, which returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an iterable have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first promise that rejects. Using `none` instead would not cause the code to fail, but it would return an empty promise that could cause other parts of the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Using `reject` instead of `all` would cause the promise to reject immediately, which could cause other parts of the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled
