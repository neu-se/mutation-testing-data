  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).then(function () {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `then` method call would cause the promise to resolve with the value returned by the second function, which is also `value`. This would result in the promise being fulfilled with `value` twice, which is different from the original behavior where the promise was fulfilled with `value` only once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).catch(function () {
    throw new Error("Error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `catch` method call would cause the promise to be rejected with an error if the promise returned by `callback.fcall()` is rejected. This would result in the promise being rejected with an error, which is different from the original behavior where the promise was fulfilled with `value` if the promise returned by `callback
