  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.protocol` is a different property than `baseUrl`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.host` is a different property than `baseUrl`, and it may not have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.path` is a different property than `baseUrl`, and it may not have the same value.

DONE.
