  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.delete` property is a number, and adding 1 to it would change the value of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.delete` property is a number, and subtracting 1 from it would change the value of the property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem.delete` property is a number, and multiplying it by 2 would change the value of the property.

DONE.
