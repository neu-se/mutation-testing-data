  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a boolean value, while `cb` is a function. If `aborted` is used instead of `cb`, the function will return a boolean value instead of calling the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null value, while `cb` is a function. If `null` is used instead of `cb`, the function will return a null value instead of calling the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a undefined value, while `cb` is a function. If `undefined` is used instead of `cb`, the function will return a undefined value instead of calling the callback function.

DONE.
