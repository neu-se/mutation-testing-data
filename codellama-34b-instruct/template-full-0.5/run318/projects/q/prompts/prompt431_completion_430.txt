  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.bind(this)` is a bound function, which has a different `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.call(null)` is a function call with a different `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.apply(null)` is a function call with a different `this` context.

DONE.
