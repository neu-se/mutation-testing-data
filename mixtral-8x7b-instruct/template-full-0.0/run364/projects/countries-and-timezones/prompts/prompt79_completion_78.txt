 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.timezones[tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `timezones` object using the `tzName` instead of using the `getTimezone` function. This could lead to unexpected results if the `tzName` does not exist in the `timezones` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getTimezones()[tzName]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to get all timezones first and then accesses the one with the given `tzName`. This could lead to performance issues if the number of timezones is large, as it iterates over all timezones to create an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timezones[Math.floor(Math.random() * Object.keys(timezones).length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random timezone instead of the
