  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not being checked in the original code fragment, but it is being checked in the new code fragment. This means that the new code fragment will only return timezones that are not deprecated, while the original code fragment will return all timezones.
