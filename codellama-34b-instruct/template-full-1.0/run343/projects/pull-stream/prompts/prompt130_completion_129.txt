  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `end` argument, whereas `null` is a valid value. The code expects the `end` argument to be a boolean value, and if it's not, it will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a valid value for the `end` argument, whereas `null` is not. The code expects the `end` argument to be a boolean value, and if it's not, it will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a valid value for the `end` argument, whereas `null` is not. The code expects the `end` argument to be a boolean value, and if it's not, it will throw an error.

DONE.
