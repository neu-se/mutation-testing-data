  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 && a['arg'] > 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than operator instead of the not-equal operator. This change will cause the function to return a different result when the input is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] <= 0 && a['arg'] > 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than-or-equal-to operator instead of the not-equal operator. This change will cause the function to return a different result when the input is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] < 0 || a['arg'] > 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the logical OR operator instead of the not-equal operator. This change will cause the function to return a different result when the input is a negative number.
