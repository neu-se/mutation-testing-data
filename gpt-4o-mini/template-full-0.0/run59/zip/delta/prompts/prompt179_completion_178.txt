Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` does not advance the iterator, potentially returning the same operation multiple times instead of moving to the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(1)` retrieves only one unit of length, which may not correspond to the expected length of the operation, leading to incorrect processing of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` would effectively do nothing and return the current operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect results in the composition.

DONE.
