Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the function to read data when it should not, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the read function to always execute, ignoring the actual end state and potentially leading to an infinite loop or unnecessary reads.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a null value to the read function, which may not be handled correctly, leading to unexpected results or errors in processing the data.

DONE.
