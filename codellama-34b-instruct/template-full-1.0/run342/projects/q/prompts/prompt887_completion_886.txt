  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function, while `1` is a number. In the original code, the `arguments` object is used to slice the array of arguments to pass to the `nodeArgs` array. Replacing it with `1` would result in the `nodeArgs` array being populated with the number `1`, instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value. In the original code, the `arguments` object is used to slice the array of arguments to pass to the `nodeArgs` array. Replacing it with `null` would result in the `nodeArgs` array being populated with `null`, instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in
