  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that is used to retrieve the handler for a given operation, and returning `null` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => ({
  transform: (op1, op2) => op2,
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that is used to retrieve the handler for a given operation, and returning a function that always returns the second operation would cause the code to always use the second operation, regardless of the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => ({
  transform: (op1, op2) => op1,
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.getHandler` is a function that is used to retrieve the handler for a given
