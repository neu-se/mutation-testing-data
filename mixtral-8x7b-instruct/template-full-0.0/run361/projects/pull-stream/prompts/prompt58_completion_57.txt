 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with `undefined` instead of checking if the `done` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type of `done` being `'undefined'` instead of checking if the `done` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `read` variable is falsy instead of checking if the `done` variable is falsy.

These changes would cause the test suite to not fail if the `done` callback is not provided, which is different from the original behavior. DONE.
