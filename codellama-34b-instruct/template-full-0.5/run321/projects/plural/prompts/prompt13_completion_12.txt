  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have different parameters and usage. `slice` takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the end position, while `substr` takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the length of the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `substr` have different parameters and usage. `substring` takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the end position, while `substr` takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the length of the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have different parameters and usage. `slice` takes two arguments, the first is the start position and the second is the end position
