  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would not be called, which would prevent the promise from being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would not be called, which would prevent the promise from being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would not be called, which would prevent the promise from being rejected.

DONE.
