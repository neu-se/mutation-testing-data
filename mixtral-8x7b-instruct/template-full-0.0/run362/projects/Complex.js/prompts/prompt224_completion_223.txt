 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the case where `a` is negative and `b` is not zero would be skipped, and the square root of a negative number would be calculated, which is not a valid complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, and the square root of a negative number would be calculated, which is not a valid complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, and the square root of a negative number would be calculated, which is not a valid complex number. Additionally, it would not check if `b` is zero, which would cause the calculation of the square root of a negative number.

DONE.
