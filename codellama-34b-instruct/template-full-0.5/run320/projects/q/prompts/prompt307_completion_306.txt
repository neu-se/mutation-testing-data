  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the fulfilled value of `answerPs[i]`, rather than the rejected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(reject, resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the fulfilled value of `answerPs[i]`, rather than the rejected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function() { return reject(); }, resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, regardless of the state of `answerPs[i]`.

DONE.
