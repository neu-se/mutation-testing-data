  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is negated, which means that the filter function would return the opposite of what it would have returned with the original predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to only return true for even-indexed elements, which would cause the filter function to return a different subset of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) || index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to return true for the first element, regardless of the value of the predicate function for that element. This would cause the filter function to return a different subset of the original array.

DONE.
