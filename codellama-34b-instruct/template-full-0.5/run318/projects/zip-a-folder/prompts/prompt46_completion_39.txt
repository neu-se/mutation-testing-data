  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `recursive` option set to `true`, which would include all subdirectories and files in the archive, instead of just the files in the top-level directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with a glob pattern that matches all files and directories, instead of just the files in the top-level directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'**/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with a glob pattern that matches all files and directories recursively, instead of just the files in the top-level directory.

DONE.
