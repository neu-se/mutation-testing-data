Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it will push operations to the `passed` array only if the operation is falsy, which is the opposite of the original intent where operations are pushed based on the truthiness of the predicate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will push operations to the `passed` array only if the `attributes` property of the operation is not null, which may exclude valid operations that should be included based on the original predicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will push operations to the `passed` array only if the `insert` property is explicitly undefined, potentially excluding operations that have valid `insert` values, thus changing the filtering logic significantly.

DONE.
