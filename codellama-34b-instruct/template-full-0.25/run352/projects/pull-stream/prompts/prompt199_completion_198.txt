  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is an error object, while `null` is a valid value for the `err` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is an error object, while `undefined` is not a valid value for the `err` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is an error object, while `new Error()` creates a new error object with a different message and stack trace.

DONE.
