 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, 'incorrect-options'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes a string 'incorrect-options' as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync`, instead of the actual options object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty options object, ignoring any provided options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a function as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync`, which is not the expected options object.

DONE.
