 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'stringified' + obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the object to a string using its `toString()` method and concatenates it with a string 'stringified', instead of using the `stringify` function which handles circular references, date objects, and other edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds indentation (2 spaces) to the JSON string, while the original `stringify` function does not add any indentation by default.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
util.inspect(obj, { depth: null })
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `util.inspect` method to convert the object to a string, which may not produce the same output as `JSON.stringify`. Additionally, it sets the `depth` option to `null`,
