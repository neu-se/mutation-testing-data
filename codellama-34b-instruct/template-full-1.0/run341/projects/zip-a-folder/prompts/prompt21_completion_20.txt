  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would change the file path to uppercase, which could cause the file to not be found or to be written to the wrong location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'not a real file path'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.createWriteStream()` method would receive an invalid file path, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream('out.txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.createWriteStream()` method would receive a different file path, which would cause the output to be written to a different file.

DONE.
