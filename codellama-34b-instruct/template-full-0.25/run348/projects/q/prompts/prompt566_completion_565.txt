  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `when` returns a promise for the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, whereas `when` returns a promise for the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, whereas `when` returns a promise for the resolved value.

DONE.
