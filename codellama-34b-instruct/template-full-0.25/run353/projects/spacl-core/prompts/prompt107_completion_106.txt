  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substring(1)` would return the substring of `path` starting from the second character, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.toLowerCase()` would return the lowercase version of `path`, whereas `path` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split('/')[0]` would return the first element of the array returned by `path.split('/')`, whereas `path` would return the entire string.

DONE.
