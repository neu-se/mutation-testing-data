  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform the test on the `data` variable, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `test` function as an argument to the `tester` function, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform the test on the `data` variable, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
