  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would never be called, even if the operation was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a value of null, even if the operation was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with an empty function, even if the operation was successful.

DONE.
