  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledRejections` array to an empty array, potentially hiding any unhandled rejections that had been detected earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `promise` object to the `unhandledRejections` array, potentially causing the `unhandledRejections` array to grow indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `reason` object to the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially causing the `unhandledReasons` array to grow indefinitely.

DONE.
