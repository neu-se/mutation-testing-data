  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator will return null if replacer is falsey, which could cause JSON.stringify to error if replacer is not a function that can be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator will attempt to convert replacer to a number and then add 1 to it, which could cause JSON.stringify to error if replacer is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the [0] index operator will attempt to access the first element of replacer, which could cause JSON.stringify to error if replacer is not an array or a string.

DONE.
