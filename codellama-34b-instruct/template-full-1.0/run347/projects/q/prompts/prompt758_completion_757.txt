  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allFulfilled" is not a valid Q method, and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allResolved" is not a valid Q method, and would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because "any" is a valid Q method, but it would not accomplish the same goal as the original code fragment, which was to return a promise for an array of promises that have all been settled.

DONE.
