  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` if the operand is truthy. In this case, `op` is an object, which is truthy, so `!op` would return `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if `op` has a `delete` property.

DONE.
