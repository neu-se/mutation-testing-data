  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `attempt1[1]` is a non-empty string, regardless of whether it contains a file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] !== ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `attempt1[1]` is a non-empty string, regardless of whether it contains a file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1].length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `attempt1[1]` is a non-empty string, regardless of whether it contains a file name and line number.

DONE.
