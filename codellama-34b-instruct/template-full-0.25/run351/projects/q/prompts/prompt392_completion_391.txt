  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the functions being passed in rely on the specific order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, "extra argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the list of arguments, which could potentially cause issues if the functions being passed in do not expect this extra argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because a null value has been added to the list of arguments, which could potentially cause issues if the functions being passed in do not expect a null value.

DONE.
