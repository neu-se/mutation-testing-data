  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the policy name, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name is not the same length as the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the policy name on the `.` character, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy name contains multiple `.` characters.

DONE.
