  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/ig
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would make the match case-insensitive, while the original regex does not have this flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` pattern matches any character zero or more times, while the original regex matches a letter `a` at the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\b` anchor matches a word boundary, while the original regex matches a letter `a` at the end of the word.

DONE.
