  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `cb` function to be called with `null` instead of `end` when `end` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` instead of `acc` when `end` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? acc : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `acc` instead of `null` when `end` is `false`.

DONE.
