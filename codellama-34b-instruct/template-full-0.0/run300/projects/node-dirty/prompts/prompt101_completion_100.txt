  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if it is the string `'undefined'`.

DONE.
