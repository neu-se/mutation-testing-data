 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is null, instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause unexpected behavior if `a` is undefined or any other non-object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not a function, instead of checking if `a` is not an object. This could cause unexpected behavior if `a` is an array, a primitive value, or any other non-object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is an array, instead of checking if `a` is an object. This could cause unexpected behavior if `a` is a primitive value, null, or any other non-object value.
