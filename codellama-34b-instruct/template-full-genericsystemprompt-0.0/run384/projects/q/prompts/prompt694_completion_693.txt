  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise with the value of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(1)` would resolve the promise with the value `1`, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise with the value of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with the value `null`, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise with the value of the object.

DONE.
