  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` would return the actual value of the promise, not a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` would throw an error and would not reach the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the behavior for progress notifications would change, which would not be desirable.

DONE.
