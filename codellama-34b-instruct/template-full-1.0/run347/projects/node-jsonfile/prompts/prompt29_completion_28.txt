  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` would attempt to parse the input string as JSON, which may not be what was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify.toJSON
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify.toJSON` is a method that serializes an object into a JSON string, but it is not equivalent to `JSON.stringify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a function that serializes a JavaScript value into a JSON string, but it is not equivalent to `stringify`.

DONE.
