  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expected to return the result of `Q`, but with `return` instead, it will return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expected to return a promise, but with `throw new Error("test")` instead, it will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q({})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expected to return a promise, but with `return Q({})` instead, it will return a different promise that resolves with an empty object.

DONE.
