  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the `get` method would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `val` property to be different from the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the `get` method would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `val` property to be different from the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by the `get` method would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `val` property to be different from the original value.

DONE.
