  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the URL string to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the URL string, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/[a-z]/gi, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove all lowercase letters from the URL string, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting logic.

DONE.
