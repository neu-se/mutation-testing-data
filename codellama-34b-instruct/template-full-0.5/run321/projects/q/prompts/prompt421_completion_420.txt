  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a more general function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, not just a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotPromise` is a function that checks if an object is not a promise, and would return `true` for promise-like objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of `isPromise`, returning `true` for non-promise objects and `false` for promise objects.

DONE.
