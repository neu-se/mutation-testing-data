  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array element to remove by 1, potentially removing the wrong element or causing an error if the index is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array element to remove by -1, potentially removing the wrong element or causing an error if the index is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the array instead of the index of the element to remove, potentially removing the wrong element or causing an error if the index is out of bounds.

DONE.
