Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `become` function would cause the promise to resolve with a non-thenable value, which may lead to unexpected behavior in promise chaining or handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the promise with `undefined` would not fulfill the promise with a meaningful value, potentially leading to confusion or errors in subsequent promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the promise with a string value ("resolved") would change the expected resolution type, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise in the consumer code that expects a different type (like an object or a function).

DONE.
