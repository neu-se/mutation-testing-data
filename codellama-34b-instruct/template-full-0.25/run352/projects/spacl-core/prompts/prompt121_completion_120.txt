  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of the original path, starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment would return the original path and the query context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase(), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return the original path in uppercase, whereas the original code fragment would return the original path and the query context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/'), ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of substrings split by the '/' character, whereas the original code fragment would return the original path and the query context.

DONE.
