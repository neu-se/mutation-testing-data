  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an error object as an argument, while `cb` is a function that takes a data object as an argument. In the original code, `cb` is called with the data object returned by the `map` function, while `abortCb` is called with the error object returned by the `read` function. By replacing `cb` with `abortCb`, the code would call the `map` function with the error object, which could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
