  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the third argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "foo" would be passed as the third argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
