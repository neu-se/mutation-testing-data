  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chilles'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second word is spelled incorrectly. The correct plural of chilli is chillies, not chilles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillie'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second word is spelled incorrectly. The correct plural of chilli is chillies, not chillie.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillen'
```
This would result in different behavior because chillen is not a valid English word. The correct plural of chilli is chillies.

DONE.
