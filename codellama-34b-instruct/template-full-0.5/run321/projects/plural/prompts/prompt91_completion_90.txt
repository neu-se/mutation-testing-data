  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for the word "chilli" but the new code fragment is looking for the word "chillis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for the word "chilli" but the new code fragment is looking for the word "chillies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for the word "chilli" but the new code fragment is looking for the word "chill".

DONE.
