  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(sourceUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrl` variable as the second argument to the `parse` function, while this replacement uses `sourceUrl` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrl` variable as the second argument to the `parse` function, while this replacement uses `baseUrlStr` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl = parse(embedBaseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `baseUrl` variable as the second argument to the `parse` function, while this replacement uses `embedBaseUrlStr` directly.

DONE.
