  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `embedType` variable as a key in an object, but this replacement would convert the key to lowercase, potentially causing a mismatch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `embedType` variable as a key in an object, but this replacement would add the string 'foo' to the end of the key, potentially causing a mismatch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `embedType` variable as a key in an object, but this replacement would return the length of the string, potentially causing a mismatch.

DONE.
