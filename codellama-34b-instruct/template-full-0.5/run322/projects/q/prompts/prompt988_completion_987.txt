  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the method to be called with incorrect parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "get", which could cause the method to be called with incorrect parameters or return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional null argument is added to the end of the argument list, which could cause the method to be called with incorrect parameters.

DONE.
