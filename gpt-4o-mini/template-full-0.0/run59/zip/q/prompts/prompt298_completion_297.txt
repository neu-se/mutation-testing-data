Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately with the value of `x`, rather than creating a new promise that joins `x` and `y`, potentially leading to different outcomes if `x` and `y` are not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value of `x`, instead of attempting to join `x` and `y`, which would prevent the promise from resolving successfully if `x` and `y` are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve all promises in an array containing `x` and `y`, rather than checking if `x` and `y` are the same, which could lead to a successful resolution even if `x` and `y` are not equal.

DONE.
