  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the `toString` method on the `Object.prototype` object, which is not the same as invoking the `toString` method directly on the `Object.prototype` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that, when called, will invoke the `toString` method on the `Object.prototype` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the `toString` method on the `Object.prototype` object, passing in the `Object.prototype` object as the `this` value.

DONE.
