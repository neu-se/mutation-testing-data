  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would not be called with a promise, and the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` callbacks would not be registered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would not be called with a promise, and the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` callbacks would not be registered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called with a rejected promise, and the `onRejected` callback would be called immediately.

DONE.
