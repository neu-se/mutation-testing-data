  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(tools)
```
This would result in different behavior because `clothes` and `tools` are two different arrays, and `concat` will create a new array by combining the elements of both arrays, whereas the original code fragment only includes `clothes`.

DONE.
