  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given value (or promised value).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise for an array of the resolutions of the given promises, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given value (or promised value).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread(object, callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.spread` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given value (or promised value).

DONE.
