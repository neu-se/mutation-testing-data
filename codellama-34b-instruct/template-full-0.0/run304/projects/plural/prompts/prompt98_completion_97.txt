  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "woman," but the replacement string "e" does not match the letter "a," so the resulting word would be "wome."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "woman," but the replacement string "i" does not match the letter "a," so the resulting word would be "womi."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'o')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches the letter "a" in the word "woman," but the replacement string "o" does not match the letter "a," so the resulting word would be "woan."
