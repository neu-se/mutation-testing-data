  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that changes the content of an array, while `slice` is a method that creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is a method that creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, while `slice` is a method that creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a method that creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `slice` is a method that creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
