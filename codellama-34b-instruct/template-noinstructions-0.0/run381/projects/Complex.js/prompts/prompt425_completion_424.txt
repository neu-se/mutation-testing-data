  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.
