  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is not called, which means the promise will never be resolved, even if the request succeeds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid function, so it will throw an error when the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid function, so it will throw an error when the promise is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
