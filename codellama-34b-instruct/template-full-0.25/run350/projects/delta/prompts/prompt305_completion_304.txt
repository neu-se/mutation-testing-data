  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would always be negative, which would cause the `eachLine` method to return early without iterating over the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would always be zero, which would cause the `eachLine` method to return early without iterating over the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would always be greater than one, which would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire line and potentially call the `predicate` function with a line that is not empty.

DONE.
