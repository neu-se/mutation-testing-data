  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject({
    index: index,
    value: progress
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function will no longer notify the deferred with the progress value on each update.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("" + err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection message would change to the stringified error object, rather than the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve({
    index: index,
    value: progress
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would now resolve the deferred with the progress value on each update, rather than only rejecting it if all promises have been rejected.

DONE.
