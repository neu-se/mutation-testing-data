  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(Math.floor(offset / 60))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the floor of the offset divided by 60, rather than the absolute value of the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset % 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remainder of the offset divided by 60, rather than the absolute value of the offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset * 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the offset and 60, rather than the absolute value of the offset.

DONE.
