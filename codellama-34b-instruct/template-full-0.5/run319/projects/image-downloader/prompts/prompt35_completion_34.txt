  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the response data directly to the write stream, without first consuming it to free up memory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest), { end: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the response data to the write stream, but would not close the write stream after the response has been consumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest), { end: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pipe the response data to the write stream, and would close the write stream after the response has been consumed.

DONE.
