  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method with the `error` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `error` value, whereas the original code fragment would not call the `reject` method and would therefore not cause the promise to be rejected.
