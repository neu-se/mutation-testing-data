  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const data = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `thisOp.retain` to a new variable `data`, rather than mutating the original `thisOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const data = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.retain` to a new variable `data`, rather than mutating the original `otherOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const data = thisOp.retain + otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain` together, rather than mutating the original `thisOp` or `otherOp` objects.

DONE.
