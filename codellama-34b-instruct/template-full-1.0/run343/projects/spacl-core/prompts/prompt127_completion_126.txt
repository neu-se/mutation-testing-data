  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the index 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the index -1, which is outside the range of the array, and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = count - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the index count - 1, which is the last element of the array, and would only iterate over the last element instead of all elements in the array.

DONE.
