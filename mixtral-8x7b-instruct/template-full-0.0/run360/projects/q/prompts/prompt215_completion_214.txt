 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * value
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the `value` argument from the original type (which could be anything) to a number. This could cause issues if the `isPromiseAlike` function checks for the type of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value || {}
