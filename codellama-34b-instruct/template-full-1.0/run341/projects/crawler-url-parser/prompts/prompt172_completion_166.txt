  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.parent like 'electron-window-manager'
```
This would result in different behavior because the line would check if the module's parent is a string that contains 'electron-window-manager', which would likely be false in most cases and would not execute any code within the block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.parent -getProperty('electron-window-manager')
```
This would result in different behavior because the line would subtract the value of the 'electron-window-manager' property from the module's parent object, which would likely throw an error due to the invalid property reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.parent.split('electron-window-manager')
```
This would result in different behavior because the line would split the module's parent string using 'electron-window-manager' as a delimiter, which would likely return an array with multiple elements, causing the next lines to execute differently.
