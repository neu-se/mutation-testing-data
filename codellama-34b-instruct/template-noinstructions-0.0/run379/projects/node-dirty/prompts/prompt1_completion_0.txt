  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `_load` method, which loads the data from the file system, but this replacement code overrides the `_load` method with an empty function, so the data will not be loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Failed to load data'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `_load` method, which loads the data from the file system, but this replacement code overrides the `_load` method with a function that throws an error, so the data will not be loaded and an error will be thrown instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._data = new Map(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `_load` method, which loads the data from the file system, but this replacement code overrides the
