  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.forEach` and `Array.prototype.slice` have different return values and ways of working.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.keys` and `Array.prototype.slice` have different return values and ways of working.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` and `Array.prototype.slice` have different return values and ways of working.

DONE.
