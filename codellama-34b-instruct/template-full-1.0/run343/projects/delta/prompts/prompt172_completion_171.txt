  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using a random number instead of the length of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the constant 0 instead of the length of the iterator.

DONE.
