  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have properties, so `object_hasOwnProperty(null, key)` would always return `false`, even if `key` is a property of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have properties, so `object_hasOwnProperty(undefined, key)` would always return `false`, even if `key` is a property of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.prototype` is a property of the `object` constructor function, and it is not a primitive value, so `object_hasOwnProperty(object.prototype, key)` would return `true` if `key` is a property of `object.prototype`, even if `key` is not a property of `
