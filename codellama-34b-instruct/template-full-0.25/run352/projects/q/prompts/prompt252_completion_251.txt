  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the context of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` invoke a function with a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `newPromise`, and it would change the context of the function call.

DONE.
