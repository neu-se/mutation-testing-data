  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is changed from 1 to 2, which would cause the function to start slicing the `arguments` array from the third element instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is changed from 1 to 0, which would cause the function to start slicing the `arguments` array from the first element instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is changed from 1 to -1, which would cause the function to start s
