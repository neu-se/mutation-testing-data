  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `promiseDispatch` function as the argument to the `fallback` function, rather than the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `promiseDispatch` function as the argument to the `fallback` function, rather than the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, rather than the `args` array itself.

DONE.
