 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current promise object, which may not have the same properties as the original `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and passing it as the second argument to `Array.prototype.slice()` would return the entire `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object and attempts to access the `key` property, which would always return `undefined` regardless of the original `object`.

DONE.
