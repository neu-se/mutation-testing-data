 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of a new Op object, which may not have the necessary properties and methods for further processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the newOp variable to null, which would cause issues when trying to access properties and methods of newOp later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it reuses the thisOp variable instead of creating a new Op object. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the thisOp object has properties or methods that are not intended for the newOp variable.

DONE.
