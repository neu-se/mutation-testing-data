  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.exit()
```
This would result in a TypeError because `null` does not have a method called `exit()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined.exit()
```
This would result in a TypeError because `undefined` does not have a method called `exit()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false.exit()
```
This would result in a TypeError because `false` does not have a method called `exit()`.

DONE.
