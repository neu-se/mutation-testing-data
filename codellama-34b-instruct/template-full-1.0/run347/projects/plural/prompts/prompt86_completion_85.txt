  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peoples')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would cause "person" to be pluralized to "peoples", instead of the correct plural form "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would cause "person" to be pluralized to "persons", instead of the correct plural form "people".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('person', 'peeps')
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would cause "person" to be pluralized to "peeps", which is not a valid plural form.

DONE.
