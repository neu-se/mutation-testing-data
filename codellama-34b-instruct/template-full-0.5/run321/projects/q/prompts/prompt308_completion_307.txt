  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Some error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of the actual value.

DONE.
