Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow non-object values (like strings or numbers) to pass through, potentially leading to incorrect attribute assignments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject valid object attributes, causing the code to skip the assignment of attributes even when they are correctly defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `attributes` is explicitly `undefined`, ignoring other falsy values like `null`, which would lead to incorrect handling of attributes.

DONE.
