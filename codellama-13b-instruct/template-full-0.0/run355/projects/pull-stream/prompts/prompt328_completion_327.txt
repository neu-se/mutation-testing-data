  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression `!end && op(data)` would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `end && op(data)` would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `op(data) && end` would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
