  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment called it with the `promise` object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method of the `promise` object, whereas the original code fragment called the `inspect` function with the `promise` object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method of the current object, whereas the original code fragment called the `inspect` function with the `promise` object as an argument.

DONE.
