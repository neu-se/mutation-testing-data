  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.` operator is used to concatenate strings, while the `','` operator is used to separate values in an array. This would cause the code to fail if the `src` parameter is an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `' '` string is used to separate values in an array, while the `','` operator is used to concatenate strings. This would cause the code to fail if the `src` parameter is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'X'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'X'` string is not used in the original code, and would cause the code to fail if the `src` parameter is a string.

DONE.
