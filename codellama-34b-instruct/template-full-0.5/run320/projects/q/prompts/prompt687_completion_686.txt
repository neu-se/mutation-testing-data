  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object to access the function's arguments, but this replacement code fragment uses the `arguments.length` property, which is the number of arguments passed to the function, instead of the actual arguments themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object to access the function's arguments, but this replacement code fragment uses the `arguments[0]` property, which is the first argument passed to the function, instead of the actual arguments themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object to access the function's arguments, but this replacement code fragment uses the `arguments.slice()` method to create a new array that contains all the arguments except the first
