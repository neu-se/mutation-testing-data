  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the resulting array to be in a different order than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the resulting array to be in a different order than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the resulting array to be in a different order than the original.

DONE.
