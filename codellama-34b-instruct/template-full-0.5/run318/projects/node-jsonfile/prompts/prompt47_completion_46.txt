  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file name as a string, but with this change, it would attempt to read a file with a `.json` extension, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file name as a string, but with this change, it would attempt to read a file with the name in uppercase, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a file name as a string, but with this change, it would attempt to read a file with the name starting from the second character, which may not exist.

DONE.
