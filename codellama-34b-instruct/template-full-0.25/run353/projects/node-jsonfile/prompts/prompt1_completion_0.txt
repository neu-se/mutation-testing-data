  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while the new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the `options` argument to be interpreted as an object instead of a string, which could lead to different behavior in the code that uses the `options` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while the new code fragment checks if it is null. This change would cause the `options` argument to be interpreted as null instead of a string, which could lead to different behavior in the code that uses the `options` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while the new code
