  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would modify the `content` variable, which is not the intended behavior of the `readFileSync` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original `content` string, which is not the intended behavior of the `readFileSync` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original `content` string, which is not the intended behavior of the `readFileSync` function.

DONE.
