  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would insert the new op at the wrong index, causing the `ops` array to be modified in an unexpected way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would insert two copies of the new op, causing the `ops` array to be modified in an unexpected way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would insert the new op and its `insert` property, causing the `ops` array to be modified in an unexpected way.

DONE.
