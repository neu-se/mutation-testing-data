  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass any arguments to the spread method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the first argument to the spread method.

DONE.
