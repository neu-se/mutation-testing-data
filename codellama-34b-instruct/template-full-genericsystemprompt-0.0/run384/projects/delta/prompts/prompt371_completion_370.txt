  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be incremented by 1, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be decremented by 1, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be multiplied by 2, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the length of the operation.

DONE.
