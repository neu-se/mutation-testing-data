  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string that is different than the string "undefined", even if the variable `ReturnValue` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ReturnValue !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict equality, and the variable `ReturnValue` is not defined, so it would not be equal to the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string that is different than the string "undefined", even if the variable `ReturnValue` is not defined.

DONE.
