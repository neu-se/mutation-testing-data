  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `cb` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `cb` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is being called as a function, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `cb` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is being called with the `null` argument, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `cb` is not a function.

DONE.
