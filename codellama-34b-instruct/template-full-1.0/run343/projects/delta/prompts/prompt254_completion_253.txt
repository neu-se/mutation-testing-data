  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the iterator to always return the first element, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in the iterator to always return the last element, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random.nextInt()
```
This would result in the iterator to return a random element, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
