  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would not match the same paths as '/', and would not throw the same errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a single space would not match the same paths as '/', and would not throw the same errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of '/' and ' ' would not match the same paths as '/', and would not throw the same errors.

DONE.
