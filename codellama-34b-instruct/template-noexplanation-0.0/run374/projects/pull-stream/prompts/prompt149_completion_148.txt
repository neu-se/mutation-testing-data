  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This change will cause the `values` function to receive an array of strings representing the keys of the `object` parameter, rather than the object itself. This may cause the function to behave differently than expected, and could potentially reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.values()
```
This change will cause the `values` function to receive an array of values representing the values of the `object` parameter, rather than the object itself. This may cause the function to behave differently than expected, and could potentially reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.entries()
```
This change will cause the `values` function to receive an array of key-value pairs representing the entries of the `object` parameter, rather than the object itself. This may cause the function to behave differently than expected, and could potentially reveal weaknesses in the test suite.
