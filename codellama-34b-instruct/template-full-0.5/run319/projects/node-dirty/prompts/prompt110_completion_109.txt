  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the readable stream has been closed, not when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the stream has been closed, not when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, not when the stream has been closed.

DONE.
