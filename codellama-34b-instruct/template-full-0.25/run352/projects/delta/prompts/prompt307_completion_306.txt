  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current operation differently, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp) + iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current operation differently, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp) * iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current operation differently, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
