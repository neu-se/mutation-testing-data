  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log a message to the console in the "error" level, while `console.log` would log a message to the console in the "log" level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` would log a message to the console in the "warn" level, while `console.log` would log a message to the console in the "log" level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log a message to the console in the "info" level, while `console.log` would log a message to the console in the "log" level.

DONE.
