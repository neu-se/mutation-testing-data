  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` computes the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` computes the exponential function of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` computes the sine of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number.

DONE.
