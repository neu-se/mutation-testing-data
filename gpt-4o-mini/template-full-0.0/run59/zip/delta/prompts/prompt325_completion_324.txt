Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increments the starting index by 1 and extends the length by 1, potentially causing an off-by-one error when slicing the base, leading to incorrect operations on the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a subtraction instead of addition for the length, which would result in a negative index, causing the slice operation to fail or return unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the start and end indices for the slice, which would lead to retrieving the wrong segment of the base Delta, potentially altering the intended operations on the Delta.

DONE.
