Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay in the execution of `flush`, causing it to run after a minimum of 1 millisecond instead of immediately, which could lead to tasks being processed out of order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(function() { flush(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `flush` call in an anonymous function, which could change the context in which `flush` is executed, potentially affecting any closures or variable scopes used within `flush`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush.bind(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `flush` function to `null`, which may not change the behavior in this case, but it could lead to unexpected results if `flush` relies on the context of `this` in a different scenario, especially if modified in the future.

DONE.
