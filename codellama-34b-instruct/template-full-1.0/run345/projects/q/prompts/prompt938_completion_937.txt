  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because without the comma, the second argument to `array_slice` would be interpreted as part of the first argument, which is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be 1, which would cause the function to return only the first element of the arguments array, rather than the first and second elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is not a standard JavaScript function and is not available in all environments, whereas `slice` is a standard array method that is widely supported. Additionally, the syntax for using `array_slice` would be different from the standard array `slice` method.

DONE.
