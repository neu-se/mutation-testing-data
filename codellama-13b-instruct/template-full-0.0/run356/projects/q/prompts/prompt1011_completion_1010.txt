  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `deferred` object, while the modified code fragment resolves the `deferred` object immediately. This could cause the promise to be resolved before the asynchronous operation is complete, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `deferred` object, while the modified code fragment rejects the `deferred` object immediately. This could cause the promise to be rejected before the asynchronous operation is complete, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `deferred` object, while the modified code fragment returns a function that resolves the `deferred` object. This could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the asynchronous operation,
