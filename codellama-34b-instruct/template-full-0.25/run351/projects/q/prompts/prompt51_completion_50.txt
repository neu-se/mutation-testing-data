  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.call();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `nextTick` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.apply();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `nextTick` function.

DONE.
