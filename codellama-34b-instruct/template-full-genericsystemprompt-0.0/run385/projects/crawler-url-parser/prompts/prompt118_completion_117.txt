  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not always present in the `currentUrl` object, and accessing it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not always present in the `currentUrl` object, and accessing it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not always present in the `currentUrl` object, and accessing it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
