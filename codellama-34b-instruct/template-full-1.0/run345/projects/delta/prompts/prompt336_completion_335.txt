  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain?.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "==" operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment only checks for value equality. In the case where `op.retain` is an empty object, the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain?.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "==" operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment only checks for value inequality. In the case where `op.retain` is an empty object, the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain?.length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
