 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine of φ2 is being used instead of φ2 itself, which can produce a different value and thus a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the reciprocal of φ2 is being used instead of φ2 itself, which can produce a different value and thus a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the exponential of φ2 is being used instead of φ2 itself, which can produce a much larger value and thus a different destination point.

DONE.
