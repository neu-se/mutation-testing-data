  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN;
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with an imaginary part of `NaN`, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = Infinity;
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with an imaginary part of `Infinity`, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = -Infinity;
```
This change will cause the `parse` function to return a complex number with an imaginary part of `-Infinity`, which will likely cause errors in the code that uses the `parse` function.

DONE.
