 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Promise` constructor instead of the `Q` library, potentially causing issues if the project relies on specific behavior or methods provided by the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the argument to the `fcall()` method, which expects a function. This would cause an error in the `finally` method implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current execution context (`this`) instead of a function to the `fcall()` method. This would cause an error in the `finally` method implementation, as it expects a function to be passed.

DONE.
