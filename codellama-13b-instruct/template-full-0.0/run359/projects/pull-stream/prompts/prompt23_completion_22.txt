  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing a random element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

DONE.
