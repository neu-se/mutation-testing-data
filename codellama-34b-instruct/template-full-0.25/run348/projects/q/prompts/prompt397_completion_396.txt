  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called with the resolution value of the promise, and returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function. In this case, the callback function simply returns the value, which means that the new promise will be resolved with the same value as the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called with the resolution value of
