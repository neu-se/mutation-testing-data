  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code calculates the difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code calculates the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a/b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the ratio of `a` to `b`, whereas the original code calculates the difference.

DONE.
