  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while the modified code fragment uses the `*` operator to calculate the product of two numbers. The `Math.pow()` function is more accurate and reliable than the `*` operator for calculating powers, especially for large exponents.

DONE.
