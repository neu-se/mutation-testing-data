  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is used to determine if the code is running in a Node.js environment, and the `!` operator negates the value of `isNodeJS`, causing the code to behave differently in a non-Node.js environment.

DONE.
