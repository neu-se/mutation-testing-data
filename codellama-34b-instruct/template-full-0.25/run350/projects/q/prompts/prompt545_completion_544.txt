  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].bind(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `generator`, whereas the original code uses the default `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].call(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with the `this` value set to `generator`, whereas the original code uses the default `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].apply(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the function with the `this` value set to `generator`, whereas the original code uses the default `this` value.

DONE.
