 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the tile's x-coordinate, making it twice as large as it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the tile's y-coordinate, making it half of what it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the tile's y-coordinate, making it half of what it should be.

DONE.
