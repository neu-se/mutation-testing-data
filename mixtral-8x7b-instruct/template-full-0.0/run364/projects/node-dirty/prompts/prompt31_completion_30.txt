 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` will not be called when the key is removed, unlike the original `this.set` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an arrow function that returns `this.set` instead of invoking it directly. This would prevent the function from being called and updating the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get` retrieves the value associated with the key, but it doesn't update the value as the original `this.set` call does. This would cause the update not to be persisted in the database.

DONE.
