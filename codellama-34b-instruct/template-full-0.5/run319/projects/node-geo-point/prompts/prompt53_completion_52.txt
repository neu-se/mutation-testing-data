  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a flat plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * π
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a flat plane, and also multiplies the result by π.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a flat plane, and also adds 360 to the result.

DONE.
