  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns (`\r`) instead of newlines (`\n`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns and newlines (`\r\n`) instead of just newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any combination of carriage returns and newlines (`\r\n`) instead of just newlines.

DONE.
