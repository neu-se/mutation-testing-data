  Done.
Options 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: Math.sqrt(a+1)
This would result in different behavior because it would round up the value of a+1 and then take the square root, while the original code would take the square root of the rounded up value of a+1

Option 2 : The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: Math.sqrt(a-1)
This would result in different behavior because it would round down the value of a-1 and then take the square root, while the original code would take the square root of the rounded down value of a-1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with : Math.pow(a,Infinity)
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a type error In the original code there is no mention of the variable's Type.
