  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `when` method, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if it were used as a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `when` method, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if it were used as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value and does not have a `when` method, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if it were used as a promise.

DONE.
