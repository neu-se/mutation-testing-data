  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would be skipped since the length of the `sources` object is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 'name'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over the object's properties, rather than its indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for-in` loop would iterate over a random number of indices, rather than the entire object.

DONE.
