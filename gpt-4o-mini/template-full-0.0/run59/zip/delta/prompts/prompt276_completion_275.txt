Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to incorrectly process operations that are not of type 'insert', potentially leading to unexpected results when handling the delta operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check for 'retain' operations instead of 'insert', which could lead to skipping over valid insert operations and altering the intended functionality of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return false for the peekType check, effectively terminating the loop prematurely and preventing any operations from being processed, which could lead to an empty or incorrect delta result.

DONE.
