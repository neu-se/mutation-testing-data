  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality, while this new code fragment uses the `==` operator to check for loose equality. This could cause the function to behave differently when the `abort` argument is a non-boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality, while this new code fragment uses the `==` operator to check for loose equality. Additionally, this new code fragment uses the `abort` argument as the value to return when it is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality, while this new code fragment uses the `
