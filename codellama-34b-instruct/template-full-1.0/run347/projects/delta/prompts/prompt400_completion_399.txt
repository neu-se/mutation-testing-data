  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs of an object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys` returns an array of the keys of an object, while `Object.keys` also includes the keys of the object's prototype chain.

DONE.
