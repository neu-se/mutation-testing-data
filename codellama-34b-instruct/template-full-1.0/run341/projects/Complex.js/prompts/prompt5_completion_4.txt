  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different ranges and output values, which could cause the `cosh` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` has a different range and output values than `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, which could cause the `cosh` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cot
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cot` has a different range and output values than `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`, which could cause the `cosh` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
