Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new resolved promise with the given value, rather than using the original promise's resolution, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise chaining.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the given value, causing any fulfilled callbacks to be skipped and leading to unhandled rejection scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the value as a promise-like object and attempt to resolve it, which could lead to different outcomes if the value is not a promise, potentially causing unexpected results in the promise chain.

DONE.
