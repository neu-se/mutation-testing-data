  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `self`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `self` by 2, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `self`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
