Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the argument, which would lead to incorrect calculations when converting from polar to rectangular coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a constant value (90 degrees in radians), which would not reflect the actual angle of the complex number, leading to incorrect imaginary part calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add 1 to the argument of the complex number, altering the angle and resulting in an incorrect calculation of the imaginary part.

DONE.
