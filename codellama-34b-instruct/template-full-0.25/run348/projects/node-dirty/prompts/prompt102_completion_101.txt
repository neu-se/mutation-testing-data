  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete()` removes a specific key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with an undefined value would set the value for the given key to `undefined`, whereas `delete()` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` would remove the key-value pair, whereas `set()` with an undefined value would set the value for the given key to `undefined`.

DONE.
