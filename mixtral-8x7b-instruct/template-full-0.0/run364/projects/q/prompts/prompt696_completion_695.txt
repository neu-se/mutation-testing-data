 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` returns a new array, while `array_slice` is a custom function that might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.call.bind(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.prototype.call.bind(Array.prototype.slice)` is a function that, when called with an object as its first argument, will call `Array.prototype.slice` on that object, while `array_slice` is a custom function that might have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(function (context, arg1, arg2) { return context.slice(arg1, arg2); }.bind(Array.prototype))
```
This would result in different behavior because `(function (context, arg1, arg2) { return context.slice(arg
