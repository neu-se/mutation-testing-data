  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `a + 1` is a variable that can take on different values. This could cause the test suite to fail or pass for different inputs, depending on the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `b` is a variable that can take on different values. This could cause the test suite to fail or pass for different inputs, depending on the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `a * b` is a variable that can take on different values. This could cause the test suite to fail or pass for different inputs, depending on the value of `a` and `b`.
