  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `task` variable, which is now replaced with `null`, so the task will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `task` variable, which is now replaced with `undefined`, so the task will not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error("task is not a function"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `task` variable, which is now replaced with a function that throws an error, so the task will not be executed and the error will be thrown instead.

DONE.
