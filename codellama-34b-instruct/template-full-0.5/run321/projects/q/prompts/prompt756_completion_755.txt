  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `allResolved`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a different method than `allResolved`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method than `allResolved`.

DONE.
