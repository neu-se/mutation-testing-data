  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[4]`, which may not exist in the `ref` array, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[3] + 1`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the last argument is now `ref[3] * 2`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
