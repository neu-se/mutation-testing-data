  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value, while `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a method that takes a function to be called with the resolved value of the promise, while `deferred.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(deferred.reject, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a method that takes a function to be called with the resolved value of the promise, while `deferred.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with a reason.
