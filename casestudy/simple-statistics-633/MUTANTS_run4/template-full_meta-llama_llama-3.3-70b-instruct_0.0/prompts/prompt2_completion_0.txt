Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof x !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the input array `x` is not an object, instead of checking if the `sum` variable is not a number, which would lead to incorrect results when the input is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the length of the array `x` is less than 0, which is always false, instead of checking if the `sum` variable is not a number, causing the function to return NaN unnecessarily.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof x[0] !== "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first element of the array `x` is not a number, instead of checking if the `sum` variable is not a number, which would lead to incorrect results when the first element is not a number, but the rest of the array contains valid numbers.

DONE.
