  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, while the original code uses the `!` operator to check for negation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test != false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, while the original code uses the `!` operator to check for negation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the original code uses the `!` operator to check for negation.

DONE.
