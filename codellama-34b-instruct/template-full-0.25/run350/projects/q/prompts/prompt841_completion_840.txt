  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a `null` value as the first argument, rather than the expected `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with an `undefined` value as the first argument, rather than the expected `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would be evaluated to `undefined`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with an `undefined` value as
