  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, which could cause an off-by-one error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than it should, which could cause an off-by-one error in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length / 2; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate half as many times as it should, which could cause an off-by-one error in the code.

DONE.
