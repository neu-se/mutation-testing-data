  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(1)` would cause the program to terminate immediately, whereas the original code would continue executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(0)` would cause the program to terminate immediately with a success code, whereas the original code would continue executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(-1)` would cause the program to terminate immediately with a failure code, whereas the original code would continue executing.

DONE.
