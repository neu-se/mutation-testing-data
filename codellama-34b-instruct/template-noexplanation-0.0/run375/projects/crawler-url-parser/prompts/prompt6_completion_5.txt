  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses a different regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol. The regular expression `^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)` matches if the URL starts with a word character (`\w+`) followed by a colon (`:`) and then a double forward slash (`//`). The `(?!` at the beginning of the regular expression is a negative lookahead assertion, which means that the match will fail if the regular expression inside the parentheses matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This code fragment is similar to the first option, but it uses the `https` protocol instead of `http`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
