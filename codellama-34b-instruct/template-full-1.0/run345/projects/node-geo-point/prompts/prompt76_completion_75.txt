  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(deg2rad(bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds a number down to the nearest integer, which would change the result of `deg2rad(bearing)` and lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(bearing) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of `deg2rad(bearing)`, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(bearing) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of `deg2rad(bearing)` by 2, which would change the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
