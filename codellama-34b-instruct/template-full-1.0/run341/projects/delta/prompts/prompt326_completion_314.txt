  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` would make the result of the `invert()` method always return an `undefined` value, regardless of the input `base` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete - op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete - op.retain` would make the result of the `invert()` method always return a `NaN` value, regardless of the input `base` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain + op.delete` would make the result of the `invert()` method always return a positive value, regardless of the input `base` parameter.

DONE.
