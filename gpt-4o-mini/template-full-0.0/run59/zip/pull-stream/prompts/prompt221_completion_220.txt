Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the original `data` would cause the consumer of the `asyncMap` function to receive a `null` value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when processing the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `1` to `data` would change the value being returned, which could lead to incorrect results if the data is expected to be processed as-is, especially if `data` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting `data` to a string would change its type, which could lead to issues if the downstream code expects `data` to be in its original format (e.g., an object or an array) rather than a string representation.

DONE.
