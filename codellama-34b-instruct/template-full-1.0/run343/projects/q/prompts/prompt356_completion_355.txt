  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the given exception instead of returning a resolved promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an error instead of returning a resolved promise with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the given value instead of returning a resolved promise with the value.

DONE.
