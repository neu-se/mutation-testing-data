  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString` returns the string representation of the buffer, while `content.toLowerCase` returns the lowercase version of the string representation of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString` returns the string representation of the buffer, while `content.slice(1)` returns a slice of the string representation of the buffer, starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString` returns the string representation of the buffer, while `content.split('').reverse().join('')` returns the string representation of the buffer in reverse order.

DONE.
