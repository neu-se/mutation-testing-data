  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `currentUrlStr` string to lowercase, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the `currentUrlStr` string with a new string that starts with "http://" if it does not already start with a protocol, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `currentUrlStr` string into an array of strings using the "/" character as a delimiter, and the `[0]` index would return the first element of the array, which could affect the parsing
