  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is true, `!shouldThrow` will be false, and vice versa. This would cause the code to throw an error if the `shouldThrow` option is set to false, or not throw an error if it is set to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `shouldThrow` is equal to the boolean value `false`, which is not the same as negating the value of `shouldThrow`. This would cause the code to throw an error if `shouldThrow` is set to `false`, but not if it is set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `shouldThrow` is not equal to the boolean value `true`, which
