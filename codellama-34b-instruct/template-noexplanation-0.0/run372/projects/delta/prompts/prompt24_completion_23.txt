  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to always return a non-empty object, even if the two input objects are identical. This will make it more difficult to test the `diff` function, as it will always return a result, even if the input is invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] - 1
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to always return a non-empty object, even if the two input objects are identical. This will make it more difficult to test the `diff` function, as it will always return a result, even if the input is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to always return a non-empty object, even if the two input objects are identical. This will make it more difficult to test the `diff` function, as it will always return a result,
