  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined`, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different set of arguments to the `dispatch` method, which would cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
