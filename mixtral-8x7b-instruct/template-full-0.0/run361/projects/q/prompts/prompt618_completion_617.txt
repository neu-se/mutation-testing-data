 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed as the argument for the `get` method instead of the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as the argument for the `get` method instead of the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be passed as the argument for the `get` method instead of the specified key. This would cause the method to operate on the object itself, rather than a property of the object. DONE.
