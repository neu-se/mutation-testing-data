  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given path, whereas `path.extname` returns the file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the base name of the given path without the directory or extension, whereas `path.extname` returns the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join('foo')` would prepend the string "foo" to the path, while `path.extname` returns the file extension.

DONE.
