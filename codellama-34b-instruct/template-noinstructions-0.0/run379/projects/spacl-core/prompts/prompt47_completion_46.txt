  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except a newline, while the new code fragment matches any character including a newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except a newline, while the new code fragment matches any character including a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except a newline, while the new code fragment matches any character including a newline.

DONE.
