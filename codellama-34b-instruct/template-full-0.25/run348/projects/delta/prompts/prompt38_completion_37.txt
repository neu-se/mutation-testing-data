  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `a` object, rather than the `b` object, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `b` object at the specified key, rather than the `b` object itself, which is the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of the `b` object, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
