  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== '';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if `nextOp.insert` is not an empty string, which would cause the `retain` condition to be skipped and the `insert`
