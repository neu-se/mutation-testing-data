  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+` instead of `-`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+` instead of `*`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+` instead of `/`.

DONE.
