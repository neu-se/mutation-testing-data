  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the map function, which is not expected by the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as the data argument to the map function, which is not expected by the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass undefined as the data argument to the map function, which is not expected by the code.

DONE.
