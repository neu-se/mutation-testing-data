  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `verb` argument to be `null`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `verb` argument to be `undefined`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `verb` argument to be the string "next", which would likely cause the generator to continue iterating instead of stopping at the current yield.

DONE.
