  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the number is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the number is infinite.

DONE.
