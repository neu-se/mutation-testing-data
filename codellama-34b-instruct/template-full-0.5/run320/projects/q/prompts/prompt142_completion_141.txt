  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` would negate the truthiness of the promise, causing the loop to terminate early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p !== promise; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p !== promise` would always be true, causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source !== promise; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source !== promise` would always be false, causing the loop to terminate early.

DONE.
