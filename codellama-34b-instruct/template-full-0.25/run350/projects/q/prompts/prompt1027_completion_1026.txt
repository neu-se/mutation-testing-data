  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `nodeback`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would call the `nodeback` function immediately, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the function returns a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method would call the `nodeback` function immediately, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the function returns a falsy value.

DONE.
