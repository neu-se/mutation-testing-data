  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the protocol from the URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted as relative instead of absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the protocol with "ftp" instead of "http" or "https", which could cause the URL to be interpreted as a different protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://www.example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the protocol with "http" and the hostname with "www.example.com", which could cause the URL to be interpreted as a different host.

DONE.
