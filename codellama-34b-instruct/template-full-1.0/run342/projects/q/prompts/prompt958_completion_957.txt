null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this` refers to the current object, while `null` would refer to the global object or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this` refers to the current object, while `undefined` would refer to the global object or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this` refers to the current object, while `this` would refer to the global object or undefined.

DONE.
