  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` reverses the elements of an array, while `array_slice` extracts a slice of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the array, rather than returning the first element like `array_slice(0, 1)` would.

DONE.
