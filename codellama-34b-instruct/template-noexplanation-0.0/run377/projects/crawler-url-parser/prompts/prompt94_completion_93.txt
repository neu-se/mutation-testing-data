  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + 'a'
```
This change will cause the `href` attribute to be concatenated with the string `'a'`, which will result in a different URL being passed to the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace('http', 'https')
```
This change will cause the `href` attribute to be replaced with a version that uses the `https` protocol instead of `http`, which may cause the `parse` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split('?')[0]
```
This change will cause the `href` attribute to be split on the `?` character and the first part of the resulting array to be passed to the `parse` function. This may cause the `parse` function to behave differently if the `href` attribute contains a query string.

DONE.
