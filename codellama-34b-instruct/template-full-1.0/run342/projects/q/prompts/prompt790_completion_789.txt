  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a primitive value and not a function, so it would throw an error when invoked as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a function and would throw an error when invoked as one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error immediately, causing the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
