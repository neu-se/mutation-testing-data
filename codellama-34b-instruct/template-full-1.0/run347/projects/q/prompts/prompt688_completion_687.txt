  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello world"` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when invoked.

DONE.
