 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"__set__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string is changed, and it would not match the `set` method in the `dispatch` method, causing the code to fail when trying to access the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is being passed instead of an actual method name, causing the code to fail when trying to call the method on the `deferred.resolve` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.del
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.del` is being passed instead of the string `"set"`, causing the code to call the `del` method instead of the `set` method in the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
