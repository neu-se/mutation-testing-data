  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by 2 would result in a different angle measurement, which could cause the final bearing calculation to be off.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `Math.PI` would result in a different angle measurement, which could cause the final bearing calculation to be off.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator would result in a different angle measurement, which could cause the final bearing calculation to be off.

Please note that these code fragments are just examples and may not be functionally correct in the context of the original code. The important thing is to show that the intended behavior
