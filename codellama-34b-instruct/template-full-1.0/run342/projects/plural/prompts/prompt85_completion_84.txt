  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "mouses" is not a recognized plural form of "mouse". The code would return "mouses" as the plural form of "mouse" instead of the correct "mice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "mous" is not a recognized singular form of "mouse". The code would return "mouse" as the plural form of "mous" instead of the correct "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "mice" is not a recognized singular form of "mouse". The code would return "mouse" as the plural form of "mice" instead of the correct "mice".

DONE.
