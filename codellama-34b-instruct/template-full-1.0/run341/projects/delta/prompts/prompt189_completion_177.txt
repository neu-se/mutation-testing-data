  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the `attributes` property is undefined or null, while this fragment always returns true, which could cause the program to misbehave if the `attributes` property is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the `attributes` property is undefined or null, while this fragment always returns undefined, which could cause the program to misbehave if the `attributes` property is not set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the `attributes` property is undefined or null, while this fragment always returns null, which could cause the program to misbehave if the `attributes` property is not set.
