  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function expects two arguments, but the second argument is missing in the replacement code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function expects two arguments, but the third argument is added in the replacement code fragment, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function expects two arguments, but the third argument is an object, which would cause an error.

DONE.
