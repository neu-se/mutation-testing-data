  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns `true`. This would cause the `next` function to be called repeatedly, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
