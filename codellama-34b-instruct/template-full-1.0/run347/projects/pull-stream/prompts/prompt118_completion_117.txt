  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would always be truthy (non-null, non-zero, non-empty string), causing the first branch to always be taken, even if `acc` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` and `acc` would be evaluated first using logical AND, which would cause the second branch to always be taken, even if `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc !== end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `acc` and `end` are not strictly equal (i.e., have different types or values), which is unlikely to be the intended behavior.

DONE.
