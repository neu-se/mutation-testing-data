  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the success and failure callbacks, which would likely cause the promise to be resolved or rejected immediately.

DONE.
