Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to invoke a "get" operation instead of a "post" operation, leading to incorrect method invocation and potentially causing the promise to resolve with an unexpected value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from "post" to "apply", which would alter how the arguments are handled and could lead to incorrect function execution or argument binding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the operation name, causing the dispatch to fail or behave unexpectedly, as there would be no valid operation to invoke on the object.

DONE.
