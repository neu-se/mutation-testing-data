  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would now have the value of `2`, which could cause the loops to run more or fewer times than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would now have the value of `null`, which could cause the loops to throw an error when attempting to access the `index` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would now have the value of `undefined`, which could cause the loops to throw an error when attempting to access the `index` property.

DONE.
