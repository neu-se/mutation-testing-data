  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 part_count_diff <= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include "internal" links that point to a higher directory level than the current page, which the original code would not have captured.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 part_count_diff != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include "internal" links that point to a different directory level than the current page, which the original code would not have captured.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only capture "internal" links that point to a higher directory level than the current page, which would miss links that point to a different directory level.

DONE.
