  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked element is an insert and its length is less than or equal to firstLeft, while the modified code fragment only checks if the peeked element is an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked element is an insert and its length is less than or equal to firstLeft, while the modified code fragment only checks if the peeked element is an insert and its length is less than firstLeft.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft)
