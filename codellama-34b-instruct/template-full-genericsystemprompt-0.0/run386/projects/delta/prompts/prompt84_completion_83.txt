  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch than it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
