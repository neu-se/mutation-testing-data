  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be applied to the incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be applied to the incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be applied to the incorrect value.

DONE.
