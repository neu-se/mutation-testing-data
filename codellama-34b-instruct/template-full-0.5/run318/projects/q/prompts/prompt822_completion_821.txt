  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `undefined` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method expects a promise as its argument, and passing `this` (which refers to the `Promise` object itself) would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
