  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result_normalize_options` parameter is set to `false`, which would prevent the URL from being normalized. This could potentially cause the URL to be interpreted incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result_normalize_options` parameter is set to `true`, which would normalize the URL, but the `removeQueryParameters` option is removed. This could potentially cause the query parameters to be included in the URL, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseURI` parameter is set to `false`, which means that the URL is not resolved relative to a base URL.
