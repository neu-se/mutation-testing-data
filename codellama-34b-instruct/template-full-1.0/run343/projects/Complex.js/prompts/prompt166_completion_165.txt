  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` function is only checking for the presence of the `Infinity` value, but the replaced code fragment would also catch the `NaN` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being compared against the `z` object's `re` property, which would catch if the `z` object's `re` property is not equal to the `a` argument, but the original code fragment only checked if `this` object's `re` property is equal to the `a` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > ZERO
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` function is being applied to the `b` variable, which would catch
