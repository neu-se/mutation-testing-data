  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cosh`, which is the hyperbolic cosine function, whereas this code fragment calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cosh`, which is the hyperbolic cosine function, whereas this code fragment calculates the ratio of `a` to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a^b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cosh`, which is the hyperbolic cosine function, whereas this code fragment calculates `a` raised to the power of `b`.

DONE.
