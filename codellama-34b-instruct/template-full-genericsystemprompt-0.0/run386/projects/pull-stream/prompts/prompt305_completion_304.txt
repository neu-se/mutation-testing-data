  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `cb` function if `ended` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would call `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `cb` function if `ended` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would call `cb` regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function if `ended` is truthy, but it would also call `cb` if `ended` is falsy, whereas the original code fragment would only call `cb` if `ended` is falsy.

DONE.
