Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the string 'extra' to the file name, potentially causing the file read operation to fail if the file does not exist with that modified name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the options object instead of the file name, which would lead to an error since `fs.readFile` expects a file path as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the file name to uppercase, which may not match the actual file name on a case-sensitive file system, leading to a file not found error.

DONE.
