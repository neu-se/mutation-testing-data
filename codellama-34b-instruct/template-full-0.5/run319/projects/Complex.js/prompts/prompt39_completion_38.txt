  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the value of `e` (approximately 2.718) raised to the power of the argument, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of the argument.

DONE.
