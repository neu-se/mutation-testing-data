  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"orange"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the exception with the string "orange".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the exception with the variable "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the exception with a promise for the value of the exception.

DONE.
