Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the string "key" as a property name instead of the variable `key`, potentially missing properties that are defined with the variable's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` condition to always evaluate to false, leading to all properties being ignored, and thus returning an empty array regardless of the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the property `null`, which is not a valid property name, leading to the same issue as using `undefined`, resulting in an empty array being returned.

DONE.
