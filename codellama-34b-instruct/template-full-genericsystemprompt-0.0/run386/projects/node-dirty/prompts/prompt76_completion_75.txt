  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the database is empty, while the new code fragment returns 1, indicating that the database contains at least one key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the database is empty, while the new code fragment returns -1, indicating that the database contains at least one key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 0, indicating that the database is empty, while the new code fragment returns Infinity, indicating that the database contains an infinite number of keys.

DONE.
