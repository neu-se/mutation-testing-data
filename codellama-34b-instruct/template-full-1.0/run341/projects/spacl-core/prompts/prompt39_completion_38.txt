  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()`
This would result in different behavior because `.slice()` is called with a different argument. The `2` would slice the array starting from the second element, instead of the first element. This would change the order of the parts in the array, and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()`
This would result in different behavior because `.slice()` is called with a different argument. The `1` would slice the array starting from the second element, instead of the first element. This would change the order of the parts in the array, and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `spec.split('/').slice(3).reverse()`
This would result in different behavior because `.slice()` is called with a different argument. The `3` would slice the array starting from the third element, instead of the first element. This would change the order of the parts in the array, and
