Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for write permissions only instead of checking for read permissions, which may allow the code to proceed even if the source file cannot be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'invalid', fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the permissions of a non-existent file (the original `src` path concatenated with 'invalid'), which will always throw an error, regardless of the actual permissions of the `src`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both read and write permissions simultaneously, which may lead to a situation where the code fails if either permission is denied, rather than just checking for read permission as originally intended.

DONE.
