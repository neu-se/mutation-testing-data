  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback function, while this new code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a different error message to the callback function. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, 'dummy data');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a different number of arguments to the callback function. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
