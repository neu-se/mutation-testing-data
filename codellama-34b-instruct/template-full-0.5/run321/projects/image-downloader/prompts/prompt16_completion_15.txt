  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add a trailing slash to the destination path, even if it is not necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the parent directory of the destination path, rather than the destination path itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the destination path, rather than the full path.

DONE.
