  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may not produce the same output for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may not produce the same output for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString`, and it may not produce the same output for the same input.

DONE.
