  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"add"
```
This would result in different behavior because "add" is a different operator than "set".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"abc"
```
This would result in different behavior because "abc" is not a valid operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because "null" is not a valid operator.

DONE.
