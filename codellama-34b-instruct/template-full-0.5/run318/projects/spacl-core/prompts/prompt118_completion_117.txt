  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the result of the `matches` method, causing the `query` method to return `true` even if the path and verb are not governed by the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method of the `Matcher` class will perform a different type of matching than the `matches` method, potentially resulting in different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method of the `String` class will perform a different type of matching than the `matches` method, potentially resulting in different results.

DONE.
