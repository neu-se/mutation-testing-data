 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.bulk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bulk()` is not a method of the `archiver.Archiver` class, and it would throw an error when executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive.finalize().pipe(output)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of piping and finalizing the archive matters. In the original code, the output stream is piped to the archive, and then the archive is finalized. In this mutated code, the archive is finalized before piping it to the output stream, which might cause issues with writing the archive to the output stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
zipArchive['_events'].error = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 'error' event listener from the `zipArchive` object, which is responsible for handling
