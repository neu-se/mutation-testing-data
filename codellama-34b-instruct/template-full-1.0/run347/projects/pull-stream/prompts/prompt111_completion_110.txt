  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the reducer function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is also a falsy value, but it is a different value than `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a different value being passed to the reducer function, which could affect the resulting accumulated value.

DONE.
