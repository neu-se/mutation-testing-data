  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This code fragment will cause the `Q.keys` method to return the values of the object's properties, rather than the keys. This will likely cause the `Q.keys` method to return incorrect results, as it is expecting to receive an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", []
```
This code fragment will cause the `Q.keys` method to return the length of the object, rather than the keys. This will likely cause the `Q.keys` method to return incorrect results, as it is expecting to receive an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString", []
```
This code fragment will cause the `Q.keys` method to return the string representation of the object, rather than the keys. This will likely cause the `Q.keys` method to return incorrect results, as it is expecting to receive an array of keys.

DONE.
