  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `false`, as the length of an array cannot be less than zero. This will cause the `any` function to always return a rejected promise, even if the input array contains resolved promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This code fragment will evaluate to `true` if the input array contains only one promise. This will cause the `any` function to always return the first promise in the array, regardless of its state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `true`, as the length of an array is always greater than zero if it contains any elements. This will cause the `any` function to always return a resolved promise, even if the input array contains rejected promises.

DONE.
