  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `op` object, which would cause the `filter` method to return the opposite of what it should return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `insert` property of the `op` object, ignoring the other properties such as `retain` and `delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `retain` property of the `op` object, ignoring the other properties such as `insert` and `delete`.

DONE.
