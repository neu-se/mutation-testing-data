  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Intentional error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, whereas the original code fragment would return the result of the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return 0, whereas the original code fragment would return the result of the `cb` function.

DONE.
