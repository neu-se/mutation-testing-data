  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the `key` property of the `data` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `key` property of the `data.key` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the `key` property of the `data` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `value` property of the `data.key` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key.value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the `key` property of the `data` object, while the new code fragment is accessing the `value` property of the `data.key` object and then calling the `toString()` method on it.

DONE.
