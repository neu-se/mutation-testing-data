  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` is added to `a`, which would cause the result of the expression to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` would square the value of `a`, which would cause the result of the expression to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
a = a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` would be incremented by `1`, which would cause the result of the expression to be different.

DONE.
