  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be `undefined`, causing the `query` method to return `null` instead of the result of the `policy.query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be `null`, causing the `query` method to return `null` instead of the result of the `policy.query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be a string with a single space character, causing the `query` method to return `null` instead of the result of the `policy.query` method.

DONE.
