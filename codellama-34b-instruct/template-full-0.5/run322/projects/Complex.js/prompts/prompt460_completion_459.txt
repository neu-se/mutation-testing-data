  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a - b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the difference between `a` and `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `a` or `b`.

DONE.
