  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"myRejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit()` would not be called with the expected event type, leading to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise)` would always return -1, making the `if` condition always false, and the event would not be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise)` would always return -1, making the `if` condition always false, and the event would not be emitted.

DONE.
