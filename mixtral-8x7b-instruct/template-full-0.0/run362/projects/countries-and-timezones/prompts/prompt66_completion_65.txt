 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the second argument to `deliverCountry`, whereas the original code allows for optional arguments with default values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the second argument to `deliverCountry`, which might cause issues if the function is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a number as the second argument to `deliverCountry`, which is not expected and might cause issues if the function is not designed to handle numeric values.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in handling unexpected input and ensure that the code behaves as expected under various conditions. DONE.
