  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, the `!` operator would return `true` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`, but it would return `false` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for both value and type inequality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value inequality. In this case, the `!==` operator would return `true` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is not `true`, but it would return `false` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections &&
