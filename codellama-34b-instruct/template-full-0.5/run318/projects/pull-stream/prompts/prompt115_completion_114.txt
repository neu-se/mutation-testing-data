  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value and would not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value and would not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object and would not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
