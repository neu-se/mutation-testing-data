  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is a function, and `callback, arguments` is a function and an array, which are different data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an array, and `callback, arguments` is a function and an array, which are different data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback, arguments` is a function and an array, which are different data types.

DONE.
