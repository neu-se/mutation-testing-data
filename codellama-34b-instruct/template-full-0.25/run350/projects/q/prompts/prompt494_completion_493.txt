  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `null` instead of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with `undefined` instead of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called with the string `"some string"` instead of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
