  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `num` as is, while this replacement would add 1 to the value of `num`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `num` as is, while this replacement would multiply the value of `num` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `num` as is, while this replacement would divide the value of `num` by 2.

DONE.
