  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over different keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is different from `null`, and would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over different keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is different from `null`, and would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over different keys.

DONE.
