  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns (`\r`) instead of newlines (`\n`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace newlines (`\n`) with carriage returns (`\r`) instead of the specified EOL character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace newlines (`\n`) with an empty string instead of the specified EOL character.

DONE.
