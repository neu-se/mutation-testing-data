  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.startsWith('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob` checks if the `src` string is a glob pattern, whereas `startsWith` checks if the `src` string starts with the provided substring (in this case, a dot). This change would cause the code to check if the input `src` is a valid glob pattern, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob` checks if the `src` string is a glob pattern, whereas `=== ''` checks if the `src` string is empty. This change would cause the code to check if the input `src` is an empty string, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGlob` checks if the `src` string is a glob pattern
