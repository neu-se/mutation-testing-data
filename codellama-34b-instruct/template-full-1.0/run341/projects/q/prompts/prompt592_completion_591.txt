  Here is a suggested answer:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator returns `undefined`, which is a different value than the `arguments` object. Replacing `arguments` with `void 0` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the `arguments` object, which could break any code that relies on the `arguments` object being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[]` operator returns an empty array, which is a different value than the `arguments` object. Replacing `arguments` with `[]` would cause the function to return an empty array instead of the `arguments` object, which could break any code that relies on the `arguments` object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is different from the `arguments` object
