 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('fs').createWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a potential error due to the incorrect module import syntax, which uses `require` instead of the ES6 import statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a readable stream instead of a writable one, causing the archiver to fail when trying to write data to the output stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream('incorrect_path')
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies an incorrect file path, causing the output stream to write to the wrong location or fail if the specified directory does not exist.

DONE.
