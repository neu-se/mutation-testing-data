Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from the sine of `a` to the cosine of `a`, which will yield incorrect results for the secant function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input to the sine function by adding 1 to `a`, which will produce a different sine value than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the sine of `a`, which will incorrectly increase the output value of the secant function by 1, leading to erroneous results.

DONE.
