  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes operations onto the `ops` array if they are not equal to the previous operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp.clone());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a clone of the next operation onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code does. The original code only pushes the next operation onto the `ops` array if it is not equal to the previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp.clone().retain(nextOp.length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a clone of the next operation onto the `ops` array, but with a modified `retain` property that is equal to the length of the
