  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.bind(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.inspect` is a function and `resolvedPromise.inspect.bind(resolvedPromise)` is a bound function, which may be invoked with different contexts and arguments, leading to changes in the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.inspect.call(undefined)` would not provide any context for the function call, while `resolvedPromise.inspect` would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(undefined, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(undefined, arguments)` would provide a different set of arguments to the function call than `resolved
