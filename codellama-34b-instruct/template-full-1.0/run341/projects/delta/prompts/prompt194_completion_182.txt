  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops[1]` is not the same as `other.ops[0]`, which is what is expected in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[1]` is not the same as `this.ops[0]`, which is what is expected in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp) ? 0 : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is used to compare two values, but the resulting value is used as an index into the `delta.ops` array, which is not what is expected in the context of the code.

DONE.
