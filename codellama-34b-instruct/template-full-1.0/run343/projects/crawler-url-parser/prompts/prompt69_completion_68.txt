  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"www.example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return "www.example.com" instead of the actual source URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') + sourceUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it will concatenate the base URL with the source URL, which may not be the desired behavior if the base URL is not intended to be part of the source URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl + '.' + $("a").filter("invalid").attr("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because it will add a dot and the invalid href attribute to the source URL, which may cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
