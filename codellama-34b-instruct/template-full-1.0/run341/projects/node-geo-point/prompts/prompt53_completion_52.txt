  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points on a sphere by adding the difference between their longitudes. Adding 1 to this difference would result in an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points on a sphere by subtracting the difference between their longitudes. Subtracting 1 from this difference would result in an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points on a sphere by multiplying the difference between their longitudes. Multiplying this difference by 2 would result in an incorrect distance calculation.

DONE.
