  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData === otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `otherData`, regardless of the values of `thisData` and `otherData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `thisData`, regardless of the values of `thisData` and `otherData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData > otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `thisData`, regardless of the values of `thisData` and `otherData`.

DONE.
