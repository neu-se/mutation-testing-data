  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event may not be expecting a 'warning' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is the same, but the code that handles the event may not be expecting the event to be emitted with the same name as the error event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the code that handles the event may not be expecting a 'drain' event.

DONE.
