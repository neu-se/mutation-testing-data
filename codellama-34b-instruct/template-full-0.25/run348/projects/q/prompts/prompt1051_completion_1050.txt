  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail.get("head");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return the value of the `head` property of the `tail` object, rather than the `tail` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail.get("tail");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return the value of the `tail` property of the `tail` object, rather than the `tail` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail.get("head").get("tail");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return the value of the `tail` property of the `head` object, rather than the `tail` object itself.

DONE.
