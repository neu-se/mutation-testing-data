  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1(b/2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the angle by 2, which would change the resulting complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1(b-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts the angle `a` from the angle `b`, which would change the resulting complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1(b+2*Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 2Ï€ to the angle `b`, which would change the resulting complex number.

DONE.
