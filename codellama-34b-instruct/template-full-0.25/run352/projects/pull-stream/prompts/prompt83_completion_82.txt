  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end === true) {
    return done(null);
  } else {
    return done(end);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `done` callback before calling it, while this new code fragment always calls the `done` callback with `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

read(null, function (end, data) {

    return done(end);
