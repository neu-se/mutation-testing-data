  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attribute
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attribute` is not a valid JavaScript object property and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributs
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributs` is not a valid JavaScript object property and would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op["attributes"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op["attributes"]` is not a valid JavaScript object property and would return `undefined`.

DONE.
