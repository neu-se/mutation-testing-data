  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `end` argument to the callback, while this modified code fragment passes both `end` and `data` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `end` argument to the callback if it is truthy, while this modified code fragment passes both `end` and `data` arguments if either `end` or `data` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `end` argument to the callback if it is truthy, while this modified code fragment passes `data` if `end` is truthy and `null` otherwise.

DONE.
