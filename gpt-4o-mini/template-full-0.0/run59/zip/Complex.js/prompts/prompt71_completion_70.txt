Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|[a-zA-Z]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows alphabetic characters to be matched, which would lead to parsing errors or unexpected results when processing complex number strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|[^\d\s]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any non-digit and non-whitespace character, potentially allowing invalid characters in the input, which could cause the parser to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|[0-9]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches only numeric characters, which could lead to ignoring valid complex number formats that include signs or decimal points, resulting
