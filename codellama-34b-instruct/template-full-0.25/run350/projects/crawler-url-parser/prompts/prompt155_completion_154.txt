  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last part of the path, while the new code fragment would remove the first part of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses forward slashes to split the path, while the new code fragment would use backslashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a single backslash to escape the forward slashes, while the new code fragment would use two backslashes to escape the forward slashes.

DONE.
