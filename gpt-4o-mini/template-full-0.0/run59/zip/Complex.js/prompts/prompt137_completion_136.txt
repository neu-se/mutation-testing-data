Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the operation to proceed if the first complex number is zero, potentially leading to an incorrect result when subtracting from an infinite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if the first complex number is not infinite, which would allow the operation to proceed even when it should return `Complex['INFINITY']` for an infinite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the second complex number is zero instead of the first, which could lead to incorrect handling of the subtraction operation when the first number is infinite.

DONE.
