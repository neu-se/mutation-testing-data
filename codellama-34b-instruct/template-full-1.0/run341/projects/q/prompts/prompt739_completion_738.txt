  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which is not a valid value and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which is not a valid value and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which is not a valid value and would throw an error.

DONE.
