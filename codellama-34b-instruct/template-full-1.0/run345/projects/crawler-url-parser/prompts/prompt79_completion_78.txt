  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'button'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would be applied to buttons, which is not the intended use case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'div'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would be applied to divs, which is not the intended use case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'input[type=text]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would be applied to input text fields, which is not the intended use case.
DONE.
