  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onFulfilled);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the callbacks, which can affect the outcome of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onRejected, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the callbacks, which can affect the outcome of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("failed");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the promise is fulfilled, which can cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
