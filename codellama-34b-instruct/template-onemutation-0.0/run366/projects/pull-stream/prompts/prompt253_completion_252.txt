  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream. Using `nextStream` instead of `nextChunk` would cause the code to read the next stream instead of the next chunk, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
