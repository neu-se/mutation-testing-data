  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second operation in the `other` delta, rather than the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `retain` property of the first operation in the `other` delta, rather than the operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `insert` property of the first operation in the `other` delta, rather than the operation itself.

DONE.
