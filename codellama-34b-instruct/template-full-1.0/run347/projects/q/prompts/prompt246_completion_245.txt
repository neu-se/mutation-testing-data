  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the logic of the expression, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set when long stack support is disabled or has no stacks, instead of when it is enabled and has stacks as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `promise.stack` property when the promise is not resolved, instead of when it is resolved as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(Q.longStackSupport === hasStacks)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `promise.stack` property when the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` are not equal, instead of when they are equal as in the original code.

DONE.
