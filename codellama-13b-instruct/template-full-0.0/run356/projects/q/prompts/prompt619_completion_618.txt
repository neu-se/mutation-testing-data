  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "get" operator to retrieve a property from an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "get" operator to retrieve a property from an array. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are expecting the original behavior.
