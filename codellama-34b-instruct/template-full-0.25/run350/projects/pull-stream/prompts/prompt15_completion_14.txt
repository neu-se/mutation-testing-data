  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === undefined` checks if `args` is `undefined`, while `args == null` checks if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length === 0` checks if the length of `args` is 0, while `args == null` checks if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0] === undefined` checks if the first element of `args` is `undefined`, while `args == null` checks if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
