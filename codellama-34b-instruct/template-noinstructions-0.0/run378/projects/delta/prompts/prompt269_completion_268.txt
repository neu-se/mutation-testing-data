  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `retDelta` object, which is a `Delta` object, and the `chop` method is not defined for the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `concat` method on the `retDelta` object, which is a `Delta` object, and the `concat` method is not defined for the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.diff()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `diff` method on the `retDelta` object, which is a `Delta` object, and the `diff` method is not defined for the `Delta` class.

DONE.
