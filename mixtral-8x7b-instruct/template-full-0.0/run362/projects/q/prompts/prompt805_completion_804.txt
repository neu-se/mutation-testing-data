 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` wraps its argument in a promise if it is not already a promise, which could cause the `finally` callback to be called at an inappropriate time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` immediately resolves the returned promise with the `callback` function, which could cause the `finally` callback to be called immediately rather than waiting for the original promise to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(callback).then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `callback` function in a promise and immediately resolves it, which could cause the `finally` callback to be called immediately rather than waiting for the original promise to settle. Additionally, the added `then` call with an empty function
