 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date().getTime()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `captureLine` to get the line number, while this option uses the current time, which would not provide a consistent line number and may cause issues in debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function expects a valid argument, and passing `null` would cause an error and prevent the rest of the code from executing properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `captureLine` to get the line number, while this option performs a string concatenation operation, which would not provide a consistent line number and may cause issues in debugging.

DONE.
