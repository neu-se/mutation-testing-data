Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the quantifier from `*` (zero or more) to `+` (one or more), which means that an empty string would now be considered invalid, whereas it was valid before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]{0,5}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it restricts the length of the valid string to a maximum of 5 characters, which would invalidate longer valid paths that were previously accepted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*[0-9]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a requirement that the string must end with zero or more digits, which would invalidate valid paths that do not conform to this new rule.

DONE.
