  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the `progress` variable by 1, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the `progress` variable by 1, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the `progress` variable, which would change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
