  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment is using the `null` keyword to refer to a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment is using the `undefined` keyword to refer to an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, while the new code fragment is using the `{}` notation to create a new empty object.

DONE.
