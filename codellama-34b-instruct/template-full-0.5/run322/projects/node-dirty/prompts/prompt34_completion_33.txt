  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Replacing it with `console.log('Placeholder replaced');` would cause the function to log the message to the console instead of calling the callback function, which could cause the test to fail if it was expecting the callback function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
