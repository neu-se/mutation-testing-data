  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of a line cannot be negative. The original code checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, which means the line is not empty. In contrast, the modified code checks if the length of the line is less than 0, which is always false, so the code inside the if statement would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the length of the line is greater than 0, which means the line is not empty. In contrast, the modified code checks if the length of the line is equal to 0, which means the line is empty. If the line is empty, the code inside the if statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks
