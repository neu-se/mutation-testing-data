  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<eiffer>
```
This would result in different behavior because `eiffer` is a typo, and the correct spelling is `e`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<exception.message>
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, and passing a string to the `Q.onerror` function would trigger a different behavior than passing the `exception` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<false>
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value, and passing a boolean value to the `Q.onerror` function would trigger a different behavior than passing the `exception` object itself.

DONE.
