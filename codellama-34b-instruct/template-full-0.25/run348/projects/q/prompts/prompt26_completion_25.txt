  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + task
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the task to be coerced into a number, which could result in a different value being passed to the `runSingle` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the task to be coerced into a number, which could result in a different value being passed to the `runSingle` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a property called `foo` on the `task` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `task` object.

DONE.
