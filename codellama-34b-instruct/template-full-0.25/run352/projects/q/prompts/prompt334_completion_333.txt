  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is a property that is not defined in the `inspect` function, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.toString()` would return a string representation of the `inspect` function, which is not the same as the `inspect` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.call()` would call the `inspect` function with no arguments, which is not the same as calling the `inspect` function with the `promise` argument.

DONE.
