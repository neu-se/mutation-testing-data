  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `dest` path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `dest` path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is both absolute and has an extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) || path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `dest` path is not absolute, while this replacement checks if it is either absolute or has an extension.

DONE.
