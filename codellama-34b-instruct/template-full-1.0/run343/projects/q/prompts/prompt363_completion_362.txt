  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a different function than `_fulfilled`, and the promise being returned in the `then` method would be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `when` method, and it would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `_fulfilled`, and the promise being returned in the `then` method would be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
