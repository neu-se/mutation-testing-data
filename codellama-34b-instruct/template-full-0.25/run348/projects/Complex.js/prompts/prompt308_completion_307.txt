  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * a` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `2 * b`, which could cause the `cosh` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * b` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `2 * b`, which could cause the `cosh` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `2 * b`, which could cause the `cosh` function to return a different result.

DONE.
