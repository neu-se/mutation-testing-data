 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method would be replaced with `all`, which has different behavior, fulfilling or rejecting the returned promise based on the first promise in the array to fulfill or reject, instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"race"
