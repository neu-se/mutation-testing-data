  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code did not specify an error reason, but this replacement codefragment does specify an error reason (1).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code did not call `deferred.notify()`, but this replacement code fragment does call `deferred.notify()` with the argument 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code did not call `deferred.resolve(reject)`, but this replacement code fragment does call `deferred.resolve()` with the argument `reject`, which is a different function than `deferred.reject`.

DONE.
