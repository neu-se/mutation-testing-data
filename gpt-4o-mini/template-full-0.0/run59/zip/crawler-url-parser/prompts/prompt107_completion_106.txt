Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store the text of the current URL instead of its URL, leading to incorrect mapping in the `urlMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "?utm_source=test"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a query parameter to the URL, altering the original URL and potentially causing issues with URL resolution and uniqueness in the `urlMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store the host of the current URL instead of the full URL, which would break the intended functionality of mapping URLs correctly in the `urlMap`.

DONE.
