  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the boolean value of `z['isInfinite']`, so the code would behave differently if `z` is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re']` is the real part of the complex number `z`, so this code would check if the real part is equal to infinity, while the original code checks if the entire complex number is infinite.

DONE.
