  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `end` is passed as the first argument. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `cb` function is not designed to handle a `null` value as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `end` is passed as the first argument. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the `cb` function is not designed to handle an `undefined` value as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"

This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with the string `"error"` as the first argument, which is different from the original code where `end` is passed as the first
