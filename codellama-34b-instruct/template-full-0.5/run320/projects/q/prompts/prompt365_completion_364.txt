  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the `done` variable, making the condition always true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the condition, making it always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the condition, making it always true.

DONE.
