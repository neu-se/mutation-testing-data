  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would make it match multiple times instead of just once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would make it case-insensitive, so it would match the same-named property regardless of the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` flag at the end of the regex would make it sticky, so it would search only within the same-named property instead of the entire object.

DONE.
