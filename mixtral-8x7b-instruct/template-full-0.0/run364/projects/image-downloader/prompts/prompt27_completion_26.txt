 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `options` is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or an empty object), the `request` function will receive an empty object as its argument instead of the intended properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `options` object. Any modifications to the `options` object afterward will not affect the copied object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `request` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.hasOwnProperty('url') ? options.url : ''
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `url` property is missing from the `options` object, it will default to an empty string instead of throwing an error. This could lead to unintended or undefined behavior in the `request` function.
