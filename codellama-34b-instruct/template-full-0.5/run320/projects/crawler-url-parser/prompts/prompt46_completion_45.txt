  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` expects a string as input, but `URL.format` expects a parsed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` expects a base URL and a relative URL as input, but `URL.format` expects a parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.href` returns the entire URL string, including the protocol and hostname, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string that may omit the protocol and hostname if they are not necessary.

DONE.
