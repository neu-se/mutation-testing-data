  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is being called without the necessary context (`this`), which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is being called without the necessary argument (`args`), which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is being called with an unnecessary argument (`true`), which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
