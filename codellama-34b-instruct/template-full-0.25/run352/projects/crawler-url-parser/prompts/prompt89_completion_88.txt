  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the first word of the text, whereas the original code extracts the entire text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the last word of the text, whereas the original code extracts the entire text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only extract the second and subsequent words of the text, whereas the original code extracts the entire text.

DONE.
