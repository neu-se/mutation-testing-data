  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` method to be called repeatedly, which would cause the promise to be rejected multiple times, even if it was previously fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `notify` method to be called repeatedly, which would cause the promise to be notified multiple times, even if it was previously fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random.choose([deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify])()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose one of the three methods to call, adding randomness to the behavior of the code.

DONE.
