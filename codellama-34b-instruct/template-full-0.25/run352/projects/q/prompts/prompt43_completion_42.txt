  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay would be 1 millisecond instead of 0, causing the `flush` function to be called after a longer delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay would be negative, causing the `flush` function to be called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, "hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay would be the string "hello" instead of a number, causing the `flush` function to be called immediately.

DONE.
