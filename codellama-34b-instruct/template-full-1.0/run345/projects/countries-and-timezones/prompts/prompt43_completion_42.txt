  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because this code refers to the `getTimezone` function, which returns a timezone object, while the original code refers to the `getCountry` function, which returns a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: data.countries[id] }
```
This would result in different behavior because this code refers directly to the `data.countries` object, while the original code calls the `getCountry` function to retrieve the country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: buildCountry(data, id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because this code calls the `buildCountry` function to build a new country object, while the original code calls the `getCountry` function to retrieve an existing country object.

DONE.
