  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, whereas `!flushing` would be falsy when `flushing` is set to a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.flushing` is not the same as the local variable `flushing`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.flushing !== flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.flushing` is not necessarily the same as the local variable `flushing`.

DONE.
