  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject()` would immediately reject the promise, whereas the original code would only reject the promise if `resolvedPromise` is already defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve(promise)` would resolve the promise with itself, whereas the original code would only resolve the promise with `Q(value)` or `fulfill(value)` if `resolvedPromise` is not already defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.notify()` would notify any progress listeners, whereas the original code would only notify progress listeners if `resolvedPromise` is not already defined.

DONE.
