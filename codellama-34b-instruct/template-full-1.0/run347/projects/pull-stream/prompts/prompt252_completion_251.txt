  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `_read` variable, causing the `nextChunk` function to be called when `_read` is `null` or `undefined`, instead of when it is a non-empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && _read.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `_read` is an array with a length greater than 0, and only call `nextChunk` if that condition is true. This would change the behavior of the function when `_read` is a non-empty array or an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `_read` is an array, and only call `nextChunk` if it is. This would change the behavior of the function when `_read` is not an array, but a different type of object
