  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could produce a different result in the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, which could produce a different result in the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the second point instead of the latitude, which could produce a different result in the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
