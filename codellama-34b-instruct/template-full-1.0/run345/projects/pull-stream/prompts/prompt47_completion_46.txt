  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop one iteration earlier, potentially leading to missed iterations or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times as the original code, potentially leading to performance issues or unexpected results.

DONE.
