  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not produce the same result as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not produce the same result as the original code fragment.

DONE.
