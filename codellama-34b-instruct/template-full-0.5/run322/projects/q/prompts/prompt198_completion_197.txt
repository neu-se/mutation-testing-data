  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a null or undefined value as a valid file name and line number, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider an empty array as a valid file name and line number, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider a null value as a valid file name, whereas the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
