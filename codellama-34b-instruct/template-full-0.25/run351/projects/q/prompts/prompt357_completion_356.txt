  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `null` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the expected `Error`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the expected `Error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Rejection reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing a new `Error` object with a different message would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message instead of the expected `Error`.

DONE.
