  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because when the word ends in -s, it is replaced with -es, but 'cell' does not end in -s, so it will not be replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celli'
```
This would result in different behavior because when the word ends in -s, it is replaced with -es, but 'celli' does not end in -s, so it will not be replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celle'
```
This would result in different behavior because when the word ends in -s, it is replaced with -es, but 'celle' does not end in -s, so it will not be replaced.

DONE.
