  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the iterator to skip over the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `2`, which would cause the iterator to skip over the first two elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `3`, which would cause the iterator to skip over the first three elements in the array.

DONE.
