  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains the length of the next operation in the delta, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the next operation in the other delta, rather than retaining the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()), AttributeMap.transform(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes, priority));
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains the length of the next operation in the delta, and transforms the attributes of the current operation using the `AttributeMap.transform` method, rather than retaining the current operation and its attributes.

DONE.
