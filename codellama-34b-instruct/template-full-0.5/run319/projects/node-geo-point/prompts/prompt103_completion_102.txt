  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the initial longitude value instead of the updated longitude value after calculating the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the calculated longitude value, which would cause the destination point to be offset by half a world in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 180 degrees from the calculated longitude value, which would cause the destination point to be offset by half a world in the opposite direction.

DONE.
