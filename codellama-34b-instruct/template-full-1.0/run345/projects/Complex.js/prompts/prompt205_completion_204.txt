  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function takes two arguments, and `b` is only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is the base of the exponential function, and replacing it with `b` would give a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the exponent of the exponential function, and replacing it with `b` would give a different result.

DONE.
