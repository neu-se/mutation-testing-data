 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the longStackSupport variable would be set to false, disabling long stack traces regardless of the environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global === "object" && global && global.env && global.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `global.env.Q_DEBUG` instead of `process.env.Q_DEBUG`, which would not work in a Node.js environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof self === "object" && self && self.env && self.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `self.env.Q_DEBUG` instead of `process.env.Q_DEBUG`, which would not work in a browser environment where `process` is not defined.

DONE.
