  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part would be inverted, causing the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part would be added to the real part instead of the imaginary part, causing the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part would be added to the imaginary part instead of the real part, causing the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

DONE.
