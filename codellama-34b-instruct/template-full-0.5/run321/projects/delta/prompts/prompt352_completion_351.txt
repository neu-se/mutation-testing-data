  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to always return an empty `Delta` object, regardless of the input `base` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to always return the same `Delta` object as the input `base` object, regardless of the input `base` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to always return the same `Delta` object as the input `base` object, regardless of the input `base` object.

DONE.
