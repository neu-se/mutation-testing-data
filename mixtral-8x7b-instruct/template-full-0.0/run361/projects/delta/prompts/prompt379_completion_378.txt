 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next operation from the other Delta, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the transformation process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stop the transformation process by returning null, which is not a valid Delta operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.retain(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the transformation process to retain a single character, regardless of the actual operation in the other Delta. This could lead to incorrect results or errors in the transformation process.

DONE.
