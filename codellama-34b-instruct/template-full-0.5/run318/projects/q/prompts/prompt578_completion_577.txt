  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `next` method, so the `continuer.bind(undefined)` call would fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `next` method, so the `continuer.bind(null)` call would fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer)
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer` is a function that already has a `next` method, so the `continuer.bind(continuer)` call would not change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
