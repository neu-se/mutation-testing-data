  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit('drain')` call is missing, which could cause the `drain` event to not be emitted when it should be, leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on this event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` callback is missing, which could cause the callback to not be called when it should be, leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on this callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` callback is called twice, which could cause the callback to be called more times than it should be, leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on this callback.

DONE.
