Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `Complex['ZERO']` when the current object is infinite, which is not the intended behavior of returning `Complex['ZERO']` only when the current object is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second complex number `z` is zero instead of checking if the current object is zero, potentially leading to incorrect results when dividing by an infinite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the real part of the current complex number is zero, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to returning `Complex['ZERO']` incorrectly when the imaginary part is non-zero.

DONE.
