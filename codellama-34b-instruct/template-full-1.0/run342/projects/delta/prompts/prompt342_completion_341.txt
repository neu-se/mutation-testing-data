  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to peek the next value in the iterator, but since the iterator is already at the end, it would return `undefined` instead of the expected next value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next value in the iterator, which would cause the iteration to skip the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    iter.next(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next 10 values in the iterator, which would cause the iteration to skip the next 10 elements.

DONE.
