  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(newPromise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `newPromise` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call(newPromise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `newPromise` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(newPromise)(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that is bound to the `newPromise` object, and then the resulting function is called with the `args` argument. This is not
