Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^www/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the 'www.' from any hostname that starts with 'www', regardless of the length or format of the rest of the hostname, instead of only removing it from hostnames that match the specific format of having a label between 2 and 63 characters long and an extension between 2 and 5 characters long.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname === 'www'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove the 'www.' from the hostname if the entire hostname is exactly 'www', instead of removing it from hostnames that start with 'www.'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!(/^www/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the 'www.' from any hostname that does not start with 'www', which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
