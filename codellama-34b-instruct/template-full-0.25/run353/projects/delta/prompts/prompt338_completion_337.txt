  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is not incremented in the original code, so the slice would start at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is not decremented in the original code, so the slice would end at the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is not multiplied by 2 in the original code, so the slice would have a different length.

DONE.
