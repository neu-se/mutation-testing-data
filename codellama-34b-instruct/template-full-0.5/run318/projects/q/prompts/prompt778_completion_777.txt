  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.inspect(rejection))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called twice on the `rejection` object, which could potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isFulfilled())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called with a boolean value instead of a promise object, which could potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(promise.isRejected())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called with a boolean value instead of a promise object, which could potentially lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
