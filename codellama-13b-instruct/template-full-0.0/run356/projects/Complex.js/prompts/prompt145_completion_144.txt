  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is used to check if the base is infinite, whereas the original code fragment uses the `isZero` method to check if the base is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is used to check if the base is NaN, whereas the original code fragment uses the `isZero` method to check if the base is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isReal']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isReal` method is used to check if the base is real, whereas the original code fragment uses the `isZero` method to check if the base is zero.

DONE.
