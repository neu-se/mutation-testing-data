Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, whereas the original code used `unescape` to decode a string, resulting in opposite operations being performed on the `normalizedUrl` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURIComponent` encodes all characters in a string, whereas `unescape` only decodes certain escape sequences, leading to different handling of special characters in the `normalizedUrl` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the decoding step altogether, passing the `normalizedUrl` variable directly to `decodeURI` without any modifications, potentially leading to incorrect handling of escaped characters.

DONE.
