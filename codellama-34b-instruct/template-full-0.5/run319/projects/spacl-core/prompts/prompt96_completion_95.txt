  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the map to `null`, regardless of the `policy` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the map to the `name` property of the `policy` object, regardless of the `policy` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the map to the `name` property of the `policy` object with the string "foo" appended to it, regardless of the `policy` object.

DONE.
