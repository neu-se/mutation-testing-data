  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a method that calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually, while "apply" is a method that calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"map"
```
This would result in different behavior because "map" is a method that creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
