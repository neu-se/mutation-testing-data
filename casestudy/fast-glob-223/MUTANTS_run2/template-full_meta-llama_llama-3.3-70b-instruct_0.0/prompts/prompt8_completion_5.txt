Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would always be found in any string, causing the `isDynamicPattern` function to incorrectly identify all patterns as dynamic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
GLOBSTAR
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GLOBSTAR` constant is used to represent a globstar pattern, and checking for its presence would change the logic of the `isDynamicPattern` function to also consider patterns with globstars as dynamic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
ESCAPE_SYMBOL + ESCAPE_SYMBOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ESCAPE_SYMBOL` is used to escape special characters, and checking for a double escape symbol would change the logic of the `isDynamicPattern` function to consider patterns with double escapes as dynamic, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
