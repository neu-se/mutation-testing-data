  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isInfinite']()` is a function that takes a `Complex` object as an argument, and `this` is a reference to the current object. In the original code, `z['isInfinite']()` is called with `z` as the argument, which is a `Complex` object created by the `Complex` constructor. By replacing `z` with `this`, we are essentially checking if the current object is infinite, which is not the same as checking if the `Complex` object `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isInfinite']()` is a function that takes a `Complex` object as an argument, and `z` is a reference to the current object. By replacing `z` with `z`, we are essentially checking if the current object is infinite, which is not
