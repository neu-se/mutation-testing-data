  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is not a function and cannot be called, unlike `cb` which is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and cannot be called like a function, unlike `cb` which is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is an arrow function that does not take any arguments, unlike `cb` which is a function that takes two arguments.

DONE.
