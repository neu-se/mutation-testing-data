  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.delete` is a different value than `firstOther.retain`, and the resulting delta would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.retain` is a different value than `firstOther.delete`, and the resulting delta would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.retain` is a different value than `firstOther.delete`, and the resulting delta would be different.

DONE.
