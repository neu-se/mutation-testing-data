  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 0 instead of 1, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return -1 instead of 1, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return 2 instead of 1, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
