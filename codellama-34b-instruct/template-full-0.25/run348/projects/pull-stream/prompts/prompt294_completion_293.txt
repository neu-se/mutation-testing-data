  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would always be called, while the modified code fragment `last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)` would only call `cb` if `last` is true.
