  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.parent` would refer to the parent object of `self`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.child
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.child` would refer to a child object of `self`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.sibling
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.sibling` would refer to a sibling object of `self`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
