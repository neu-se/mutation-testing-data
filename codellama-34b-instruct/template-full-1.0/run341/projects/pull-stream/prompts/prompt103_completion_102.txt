  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the value of the `data` variable, while this mutation logs a hardcoded string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the value of the `data` variable, while this mutation logs the value of `data` plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the value of the `data` variable, while this mutation logs the value of `data` converted to uppercase.

DONE.
