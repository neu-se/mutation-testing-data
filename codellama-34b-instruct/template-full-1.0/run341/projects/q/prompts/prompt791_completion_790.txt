  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is not a valid promise state, and using it would cause an error in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected(null)` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `null` reason, which is different from the original behavior of being rejected with the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(Q.reject("Rejection reason"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected(Q.reject("Rejection reason"))` would cause the promise to be rejected with a new reason, which is different from the original behavior of being rejected with the original reason.

DONE.
