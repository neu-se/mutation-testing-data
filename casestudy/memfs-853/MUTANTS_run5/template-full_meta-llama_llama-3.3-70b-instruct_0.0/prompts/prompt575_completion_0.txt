Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link && flagsNum & O_RDONLY
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the `O_EXCL` flag, which is used to prevent the file from being opened if it already exists, whereas this replacement checks for the `O_RDONLY` flag, which is used to open the file for reading only, thus changing the condition under which the error is thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!link || flagsNum & O_EXCL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error if the link exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is set, whereas this replacement throws an error if the link does not exist or the `O_EXCL` flag is set, thus inverting the condition under which the error is thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link &&!(flagsNum & O_EXCL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error if the link exists and the `O_EXCL` flag is set, whereas this replacement throws an error if the link exists and
