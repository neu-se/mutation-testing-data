  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a === 'phi' && Number.isFinite(a['arg']))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the check if `a` is the string `'phi'` and `a['arg']` is finite, whereas the original code would pass the check if `a['phi']` is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Number.isFinite(a['arg']) && a.hasOwnProperty('phi'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the check if `a` has the property `'phi'` and `a['arg']` is finite, whereas the original code would pass the check if `a['phi']` is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a['arg'] === Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY && a.hasOwnProperty('phi'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the check if `a['
