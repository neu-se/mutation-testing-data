  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { retain: 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Iterator` to return an empty object instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { retain: Infinity };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Iterator` to return an object with an infinite length, which would not be expected when using the `Iterator` with operations that require a finite length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { retain: NaN };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Iterator` to return an object with a `retain` property that is not a number, which would not be expected when using the `Iterator` with operations that require a finite length.

DONE.
