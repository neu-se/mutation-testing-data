  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment mods the result of `atan2` by 360, which ensures that the result is in the range [-180, 180]. However, the new code fragment mods the result by 180, which can result in a value outside of the expected range.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 360 to the result of `atan2`, which ensures that the result is in the range [0, 360]. However, the new code fragment adds 180 to the result, which can result in a value outside of the expected range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ - 180) % 360
```
