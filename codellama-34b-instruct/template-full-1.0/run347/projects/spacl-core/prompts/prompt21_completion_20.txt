  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the presence of a forward slash ('/') in the `spec` variable, but the placeholder is now checking for the presence of a backslash ('\\') instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the presence of a pipe character ('|') in the `spec` variable, which was not present in the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the presence of the end of the string in the `spec` variable, which was not present in the original implementation.

DONE.
