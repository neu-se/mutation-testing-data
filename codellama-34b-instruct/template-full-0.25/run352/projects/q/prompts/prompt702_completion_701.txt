  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. By using `array_slice.call(arguments)`, we are creating a new array that contains the same values as `arguments`, which would result in different behavior when passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. By using `arguments.slice()`, we are creating a new array that contains the same values as `arguments`, which would result in different behavior when passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
