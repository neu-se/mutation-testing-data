  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex pattern will match a different set of words, and the replacement logic will also be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now uses the global flag `g`, which will match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/
