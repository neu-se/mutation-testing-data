  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string 'hello' to the end of the `file` variable, which would change the path of the file being read/written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.path` would return the path of the file being read/written, whereas `file` would return a reference to the file object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.readFileSync()
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync()` would read the contents of the file synchronously, whereas the original code uses `readFile()` which reads the contents of the file asynchronously.
