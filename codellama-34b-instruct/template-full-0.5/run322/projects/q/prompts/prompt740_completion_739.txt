  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` is a promise that is already resolved with a value of `null`, whereas `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new promise that is not yet resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(1)` is a promise that is already resolved with a value of `1`, whereas `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new promise that is not yet resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(function() {})` is a promise that is already resolved with a value of a function, whereas `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new promise that is not yet resolved.

DONE.
