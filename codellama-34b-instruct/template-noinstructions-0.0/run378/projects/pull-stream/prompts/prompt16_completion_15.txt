  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always execute the `default` case, even if the `length` of the `arguments` array is greater than 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always execute the `default` case, even if the `length` of the `arguments` array is greater than 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would always execute the `default` case, even if the `length` of the `arguments` array is greater than 4.

DONE.
