Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the input as a Promise constructor instead of calling the `Q` function, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the object passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q` with the `object` parameter, which may not be the intended behavior if `object` is not a valid promise or if it is expected to be handled differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `dispatch` method, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to access properties or methods on `null`.

DONE.
