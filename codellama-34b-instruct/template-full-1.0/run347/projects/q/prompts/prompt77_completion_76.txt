  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is used to repeatedly call a function at a specified interval, whereas `setTimeout` is used to call a function after a specified delay. Replacing `setTimeout` with `setInterval` would cause the function to be called repeatedly, which could have unintended consequences if the function has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is used to schedule a callback to be called when a promise is resolved or rejected, whereas `setTimeout` is used to call a function after a specified delay. Replacing `setTimeout` with `promise.then` would cause the function to be called when the promise is resolved or rejected, which could have unintended consequences if the function has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimation
