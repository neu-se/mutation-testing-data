  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with the wrong arguments, causing it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with only one argument, causing it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a different argument, causing it to return a different result.

DONE.
