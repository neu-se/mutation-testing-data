  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetBasePath.substring(1)` would return the string representation of the `targetBasePath` variable without the first character, which could potentially break the code that uses this variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetBasePath + 'test'` would append the string 'test' to the string representation of the `targetBasePath` variable, which could potentially break the code that uses this variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.reduce(targetBasePath, (p, c) => c.toUpperCase() + p)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.reduce(targetBasePath, (p, c) => c.toUpperCase() + p)` would convert the string representation of the `targetBasePath` variable to uppercase, which could potentially break the
