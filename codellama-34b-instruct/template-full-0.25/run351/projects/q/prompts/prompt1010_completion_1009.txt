  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be sliced starting from the first element instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced starting from the second element instead of the first.

DONE.
