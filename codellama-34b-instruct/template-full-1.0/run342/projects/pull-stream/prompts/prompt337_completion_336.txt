  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `prop` is a function that is called on the input data to retrieve the property to use for comparison. By replacing `prop` with `undefined`, we are effectively disabling this functionality, which could cause the algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'prop'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `prop` is a function that is called on the input data to retrieve the property to use for comparison. By replacing `prop` with a string, we are effectively changing the way the algorithm retrieves the property, which could also cause incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data.prop; }
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `prop` is a function that is called on the input data to retrieve the property to use for comparison. By replacing `prop` with a function that
