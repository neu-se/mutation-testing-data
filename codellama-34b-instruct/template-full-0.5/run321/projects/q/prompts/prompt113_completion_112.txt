  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context and arguments pre-filled, whereas `call` and `apply` call the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` with an empty object as the `this` context would change the `this` context of the function, whereas `apply` and `bind` keep the original `this` context.

DONE.
