  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is the full path of the URL, while `basename` is just the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(options.url)` returns the directory path of the URL, while `path.basename(options.dest)` returns the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url.split('/').pop()` returns the last part of the URL, which may not be the file name.

DONE.
