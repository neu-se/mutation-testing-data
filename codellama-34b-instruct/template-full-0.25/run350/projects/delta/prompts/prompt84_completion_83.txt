  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the new operation, rather than merging them as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes, ...newOp.attributes };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the last operation with the new operation, but it would also overwrite any conflicting attributes in the new operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the attributes of the last operation with the new operation, but it would also create a new object to hold the merged attributes, rather than modifying the existing objects.

DONE.
