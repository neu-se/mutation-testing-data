  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to call the `bound` function with the given arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `fapply` method to call the `bound` function with the given arguments, but with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to call the `bound` function with the given arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `fapply` method to call the `bound` function with the given arguments, but with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fapply` method to call the `
