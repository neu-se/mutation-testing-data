  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the `throughs` array, whereas `throughs` by itself would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs.slice()` would return a shallow copy of the `throughs` array, whereas `throughs` by itself would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.concat(throughs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs.concat(throughs)` would return a new array that is the concatenation of `throughs` and `throughs`, whereas `throughs` by itself would return the original array.

DONE.
