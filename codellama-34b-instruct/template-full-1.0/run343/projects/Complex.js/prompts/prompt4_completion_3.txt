  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would evaluate to `x`, whereas this replacement would evaluate to `2x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would evaluate to `x`, whereas this replacement would evaluate to `x+1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would evaluate to `x`, whereas this replacement would evaluate to `x-1`.

DONE.
