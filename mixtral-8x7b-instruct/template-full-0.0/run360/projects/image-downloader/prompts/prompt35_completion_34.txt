 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.destroy;
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy` is a function to destroy the incoming message. Unlike `res.pipe`, it doesn't pipe the response to a writable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream;
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream` is a function to create a writable stream. Unlike `res.pipe`, it doesn't handle the response data and error events automatically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.on('data', (chunk) => createWriteStream(dest).write(chunk));
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the response data and writes it to the destination file manually, but it doesn't handle the end event, so the destination file might not be closed properly.

DONE.
