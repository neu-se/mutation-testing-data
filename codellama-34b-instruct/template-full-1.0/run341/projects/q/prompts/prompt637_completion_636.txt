  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and using it as a string would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because "remove" is not a reserved keyword, and using it as a string would not cause any syntax errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "delet]" would not be recognized as a keyword by the JavaScript interpreter, and using it as a string would not cause any syntax errors.

DONE.
