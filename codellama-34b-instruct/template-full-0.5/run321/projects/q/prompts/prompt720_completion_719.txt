  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `deferred.resolve()` to resolve the promise, while the new code is using `deferred.reject()` to reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `deferred.resolve()` to resolve the promise, while the new code is using `deferred.notify()` to notify the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `deferred.resolve()` to resolve the promise, while the new code is using `deferred.promise` to create a new promise.

DONE.
