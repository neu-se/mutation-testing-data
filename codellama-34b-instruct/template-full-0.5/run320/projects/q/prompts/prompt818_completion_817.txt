  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("This is a bug"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which would trigger the fulfillment handler instead of the rejection handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("This is a bug"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

DONE.
