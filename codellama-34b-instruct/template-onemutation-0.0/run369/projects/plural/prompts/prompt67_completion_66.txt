  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'memo'`, which would return the plural form of the word "memo" (i.e., "memos"), but the new code fragment is `'memos'`, which would return the plural form of the word "memos" (i.e., "memoses").

DONE.
