  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a mutator method that removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `slice` is an accessor method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
