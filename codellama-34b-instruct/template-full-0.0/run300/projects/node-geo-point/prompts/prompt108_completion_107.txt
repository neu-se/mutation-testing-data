  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would return a different tile coordinate for the same latitude and longitude, which could cause issues when trying to retrieve the correct tile data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would return a different tile coordinate for the same latitude and longitude, which could cause issues when trying to retrieve the correct tile data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would return a different tile coordinate for the same latitude and longitude, which could cause issues when trying to retrieve the correct tile data.

DONE.
