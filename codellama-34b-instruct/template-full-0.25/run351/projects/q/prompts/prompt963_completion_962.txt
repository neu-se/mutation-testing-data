  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a mutator method that removes the first element of an array and returns it, whereas `unshift` is a mutator method that adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a mutator method that removes the last element of an array and returns it, whereas `unshift` is a mutator method that adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a mutator method that adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array, whereas `unshift` is a mutator method that adds one or more elements to the beginning of an
