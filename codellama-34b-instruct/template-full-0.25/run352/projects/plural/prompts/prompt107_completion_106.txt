  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')es\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match words that end in "es" instead of "s", which would cause the pluralization function to return incorrect results for words that do not follow the standard pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'g')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match words that end in "s" multiple times, which would cause the pluralization function to return incorrect results for words that do not follow the standard pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.
