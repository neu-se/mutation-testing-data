  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value` is a different variable than `value`, and it may not have the same value or type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `_value`, and it may not have the same behavior when passed to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `_value`, and it may not have the same behavior when passed to the `cb` function.

DONE.
