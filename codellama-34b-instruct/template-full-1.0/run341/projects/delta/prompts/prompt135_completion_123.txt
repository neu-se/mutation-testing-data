  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` will return `false` if the iterator has reached the end of the sequence, while `peek()` will return the next value in the sequence without advancing the iterator. If `otherIter.peek()` is used in this context, it will cause an infinite loop since the iterator will never move past the first value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` will return the next value in the sequence and advance the iterator, while `peek()` will return the next value without advancing the iterator. If `otherIter.peek()` is used in this context, it will not cause an infinite loop, but it will not iterate over the entire sequence as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek(1)`
