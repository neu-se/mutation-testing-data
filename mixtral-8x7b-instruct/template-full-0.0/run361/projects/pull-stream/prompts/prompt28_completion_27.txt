 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the last argument instead of the first one, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `ref` array and use it, instead of the first element, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `ref` array and shift all other elements to the left, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
