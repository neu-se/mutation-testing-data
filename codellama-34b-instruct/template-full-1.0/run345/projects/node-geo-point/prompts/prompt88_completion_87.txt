  Sure, here are three options for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is not the same as `Math.cos`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is not the same as `Math.cos`, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is not the same as `Math.cos`, which is used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
