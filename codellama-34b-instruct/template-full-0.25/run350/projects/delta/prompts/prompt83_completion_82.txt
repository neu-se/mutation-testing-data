  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function checks for deep equality, while the `!==` operator checks for reference inequality. This means that the `!==` operator would return `true` if the two objects have the same keys and values, but are not the same object reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the number of keys in the two objects, rather than the values of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(newOp.attributes) !== JSON.stringify(lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the objects to strings and then checks for equality, rather than checking the objects directly.

DONE.
