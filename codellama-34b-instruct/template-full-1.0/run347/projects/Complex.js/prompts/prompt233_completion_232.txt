  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 2*(r-a)
```
This would result in different behavior because 1+2 is always positive while the original code fragment is always a positive number multiplied by the variable r-a, which could be any real number. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*r - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used 2*(r-a), which would be a positive number times the variable r-a. Here, 2*r - a could be a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a/2 - r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used 2(r-a), which would always be a positive number times the variable r-a, which is always a real number. 

DONE.
