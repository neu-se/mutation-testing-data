  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a different property of the `URL` object than `host`, and it would return the hostname without the port number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host + ':' + ret.port
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hostname and port number concatenated with a colon, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split(':')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hostname without the port number, similar to the `hostname` property, but it would also split the hostname and port number on the colon, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
