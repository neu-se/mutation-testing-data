Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, leading to an error state rather than a successful completion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to notify the promise of progress instead of resolving it, which is not a standard operation for promises and could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("unexpected value")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a hardcoded string "unexpected value" instead of the intended result, potentially causing downstream consumers of the promise to receive incorrect data.

DONE.
