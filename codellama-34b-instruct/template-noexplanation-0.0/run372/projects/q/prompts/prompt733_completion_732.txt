  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This will cause the `all` function to reject the promise instead of resolving it, which will result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This will cause the `all` function to notify the promise instead of resolving it, which will result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises)
```
This will cause the `all` function to resolve the promise with the array of promises instead of the array of values, which will result in different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
