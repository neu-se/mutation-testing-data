  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, len = answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the entire `answerPs` array, rather than just the first element. This could cause the `race` function to return a promise that is resolved with the first element of the `answerPs` array, rather than the first promise to be settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1, len = answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to skip the first element of the `answerPs` array, and only iterate over the remaining elements. This could cause the `race` function to return a promise that is resolved with the second element of the `answerPs` array, rather than the first promise to be settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0, len = answerPs.length -
