  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single forward slash to split the path, while the replaced code uses a backslash, which would result in a different array of path parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single forward slash to split the path, while the replaced code uses a space, which would result in a different array of path parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a single forward slash to split the path, while the replaced code uses an empty string, which would result in a different array of path parts.

DONE.
