  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the value of the `value` variable to the `_progressed` function, while the modified code fragment `null` would pass the `null` value to the `_progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the value of the `value` variable to the `_progressed` function, while the modified code fragment `undefined` would pass the `undefined` value to the `_progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the value of the `value` variable to the `_progressed` function, while the modified code fragment `0` would pass the `0` value to the `_progressed` function.

DONE.
