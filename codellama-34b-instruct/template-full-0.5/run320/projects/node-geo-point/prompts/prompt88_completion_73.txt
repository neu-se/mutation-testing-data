  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` is the cosine of the latitude, which is not the same as the cosine of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1)` is the sine of the latitude, which is not the same as the sine of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, and would not be related to the latitude or longitude of the point.

DONE.
