  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method returns the number of operations in the delta, and adding 1 to it would cause the `reduce` method to iterate one more time than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
