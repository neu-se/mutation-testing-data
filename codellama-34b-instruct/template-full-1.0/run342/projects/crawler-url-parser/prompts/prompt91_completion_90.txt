  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript:|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional colon is added after `javascript`, which would match a different set of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript:|mailto:|ftp:|\/\/)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `/` is added to the end of the regular expression, which would match URLs that end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript:|mailto:|ftp:|$)(\w*)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `\w*` is added to the end of the regular expression, which would match URLs that include a trailing word.

DONE.
