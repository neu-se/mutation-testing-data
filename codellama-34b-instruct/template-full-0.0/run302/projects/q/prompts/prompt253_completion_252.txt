  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `promise` property of the `newPromise` object, which may not be the same as the `newPromise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise that resolves to the value of the `newPromise` object, rather than the `newPromise` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.catch(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise that rejects with the error of the `newPromise` object, rather than the `newPromise` object itself.

DONE.
