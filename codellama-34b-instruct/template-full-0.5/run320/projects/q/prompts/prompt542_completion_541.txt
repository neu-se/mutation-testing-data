  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array, and would cause an error when trying to spread it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and would cause an error when trying to spread it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would not contain any values, and would cause an error when trying to spread it.

DONE.
