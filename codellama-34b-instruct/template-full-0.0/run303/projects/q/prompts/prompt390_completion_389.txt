  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called when the promise is rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called when the promise is rejected, and instead an error would be thrown, which could cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would not be called when the promise is rejected, and the `undefined` value would be returned, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
