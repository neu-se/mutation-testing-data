  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the value of `x` in the `Math.sqrt` function, while the new code is using the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the value of `x` in the `Math.sqrt` function, while the new code is using the sum of `x` and `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the value of `x` in the `Math.sqrt` function, while the new code is using the product of `x` and `y`.

DONE.
