  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `denodeify` function, rather than passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to the `denodeify` function, rather than passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments as an array, but also include the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function as an additional argument, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
