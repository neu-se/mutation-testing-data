  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `f` and `arguments` variables are not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `f` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error. Additionally, the `null` value would not be a valid argument for the `call` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `f` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error. Additionally, the `0` value would not be a valid argument for the `call` method.

DONE.
