  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This change will cause the function to always return the second element of the `rules` array, rather than the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] + rule[1]
```
This change will cause the function to return the concatenation of the first and second elements of the `rules` array, rather than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] - rule[1]
```
This change will cause the function to return the difference between the first and second elements of the `rules` array, rather than the first element.

DONE.
