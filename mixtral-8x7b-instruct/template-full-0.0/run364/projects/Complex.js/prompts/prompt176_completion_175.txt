 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the divisor and dividend when the divisor's absolute value is greater than the dividend's.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / (c * c + d * d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different formula for calculating the quotient, which may not provide the correct result in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c / d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the wrong divisor when the divisor's absolute value is less than the dividend's.

DONE.
