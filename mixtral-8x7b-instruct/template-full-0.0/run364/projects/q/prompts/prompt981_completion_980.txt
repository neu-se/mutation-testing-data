 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new arrow function, which may have different context and behavior compared to the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of a function, causing the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `resolve` method, bypassing the creation of a Node resolver, and the `dispatch` method may not function as expected.

DONE.
