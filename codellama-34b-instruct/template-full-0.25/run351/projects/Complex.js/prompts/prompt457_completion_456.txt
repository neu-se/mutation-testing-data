  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if the number is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite()` checks if the number is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if the number is finite, while `isInfinite()` checks if the number is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isFinite()`, so if the number is finite, the result would be `false`, and if the number is Infinity, the result would be `true`.

DONE.
