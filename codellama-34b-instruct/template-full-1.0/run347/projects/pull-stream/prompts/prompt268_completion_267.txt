  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would abort the current stream and the stream of streams, rather than only the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to call the `cb` function with `undefined` as an argument, rather than the `err` object as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that wraps the `cb` function, rather than calling it directly.

DONE.
