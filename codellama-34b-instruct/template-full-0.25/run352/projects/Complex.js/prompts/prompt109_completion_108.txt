  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isNaN` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the input is not a number, rather than `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a static method of the `Number` object that checks if a value is not a number, whereas `isNaN` is a global function that checks if a value is not a number.

DONE.
