  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `array_slice.reverse()` returns a shallow copy of the array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `array_slice.length` returns the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` returns a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and a shallow copy of the original array.

DONE.
