  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `call` are different methods in JavaScript, and they have different behaviors when it comes to how `this` is bound. `apply` expects an array of arguments, while `call` expects a list of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a different method in JavaScript that creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments. It does not have the same behavior as `apply` or `call`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invoke"
```
This would result in different behavior because `invoke` is a different method in JavaScript that is used to call a function with a specific `this` value and arguments. It does not have the same behavior as `apply` or `call`.

DONE.
