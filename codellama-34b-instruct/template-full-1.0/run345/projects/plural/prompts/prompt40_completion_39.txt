  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is used in the original code, which takes a starting position and a number of characters to return. If the word "index" is passed in, the new code would return "indcices" instead of "indices" as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is used instead of `substr`, and the `i` variable is used instead of the `2` constant. If the word "appendix" is passed in, the new code would return "appendedix" instead of "appendices" as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
