 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the next operation from the other iterator instead of just peeking at it. This could lead to unexpected changes in the state of the other iterator and cause the `compose` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` or `true` instead of the actual type of the next operation. This could lead to the `compose` method skipping operations or processing them incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek.bind(null, 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the next delete operation, even if the next operation is an insert or retain operation. This could lead to the `compose` method processing the operations incorrectly, resulting in incorrect results.
