 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|[^aeiou]ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a negative character class to the second alternative, which would only match "ch" if it's not preceded by a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the global flag, which would make the regular expression match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string instead of stopping after the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the regular expression with a function that tests whether the input string matches the pattern, instead of using the regular expression to transform the input string.

DONE.
