Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is `null`, which would incorrectly allow the function to proceed to the next condition even when `op.delete` is a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is a string, which would cause the function to skip the delete case entirely, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is greater than zero, which would incorrectly evaluate to `false` for any non-positive number, thus bypassing the delete case even when `op.delete` is a valid number.

DONE.
