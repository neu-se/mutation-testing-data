  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `key` property of the `object`, while the new code fragment returns the value of the `key` property of the `object.key` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `key` property of the `object`, while the new code fragment returns the value of the `value` property of the `object.key.value` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key.value.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `key` property of the `object`, while the new code fragment returns the value of the `name` property of the `object.key.value.name` property.

DONE.
