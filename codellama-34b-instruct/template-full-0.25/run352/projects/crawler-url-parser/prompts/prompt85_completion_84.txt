  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim` method would remove the first character of the text, rather than the whitespace characters as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim` method would remove the first two characters of the text, rather than the whitespace characters as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim(3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim` method would remove the first three characters of the text, rather than the whitespace characters as intended.

DONE.
