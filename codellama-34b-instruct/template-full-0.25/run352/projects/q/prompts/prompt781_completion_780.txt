  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that is called when a promise is rejected, whereas `regardless` is a function that is called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when a promise is fulfilled, whereas `regardless` is a function that is called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a function that is called when a promise is in progress, whereas `regardless` is a function that is called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
