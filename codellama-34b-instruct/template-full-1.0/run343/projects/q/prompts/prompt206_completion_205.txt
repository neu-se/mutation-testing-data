  
Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the falsy value of the fileNameAndLineNumber variable, which would return true only if it's undefined, null, or an empty string. The new code, on the other hand, would only evaluate to false if the variable is undefined.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the presence of the fileNameAndLineNumber variable, regardless of its value. The new code, on the other hand, would also check if the variable's length is greater than zero, which means it can only return true if the variable is not undefined and not an empty string.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not perform any type checking on the variable, while the new code explicitly checks whether the variable is a string.
