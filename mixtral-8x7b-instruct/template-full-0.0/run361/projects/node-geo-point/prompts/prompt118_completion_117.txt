 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a distance of 0, regardless of the input points. This is because 0 is a falsy value, and the `?` operator in the original code would return the second operand (1) when the first operand (`r > 1`) is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1000000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a distance of approximately 1,000,000 meters (around 621 miles), regardless of the input points. This is because the `acos` function would always receive a value close to 1, and its output would be close to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random distance between 0 and 1, regardless of the
