  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` and `pop` are different array methods that return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, while `pop` and `shift` are methods that return the last or first element of an array, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while `pop` and `shift` are methods that remove elements from the array.

DONE.
