  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `sinh` are both functions, but `sin` is not a function, so the code would produce a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * x` would produce different values than `Math.cosh` or `Math.sinh`, which could affect the accuracy of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` would produce a different value than `Math.cosh` or `Math.sinh`, which could affect the accuracy of the calculation.

DONE.
