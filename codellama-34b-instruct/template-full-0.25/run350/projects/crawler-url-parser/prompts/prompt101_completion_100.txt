  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.set` is a method that sets a value in the map, whereas `urlMap.get` is a method that retrieves a value from the map. Using `urlMap.set` instead of `urlMap.get` would cause the code to set the value of `currentUrl.url` in the map, rather than retrieving it, which would likely cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.delete` is a method that deletes a key-value pair from the map, whereas `urlMap.get` is a method that retrieves a value from the map. Using `urlMap.delete` instead of `urlMap.get` would cause the code to delete the key-value pair from the map, rather than retrieving it, which would likely cause the code to behave differently.
