  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument of the `fbound` function, instead of all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument of the `fbound` function, instead of all the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first two arguments of the `fbound` function, instead of all the arguments.

DONE.
