  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `html()` method instead of the `text()` method, which could produce different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace('^https?://', 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the leading `http://` or `https://` with `http://`, which could change the behavior of the `parse()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/fixed_string_here|/i, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it does a regular expression replacement on the `text()` output, which could change the behavior of the `gettype()` function.

DONE.
