  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the `reason` value, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the `reason` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error(reason))` would reject the promise with an error object containing the `reason` value, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the `reason` value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify(reason)` would notify the promise with the `reason` value, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the `reason` value.

DONE.
