 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'word, rule[1]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the second element of the rule array (the result function or string) instead of the first element (the matching pattern).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word, word.match(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `match` method instead of the `test` method for the regular expression. This change would cause the function to return the first match instead of a boolean value, potentially causing incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word, word.replace(rule[0], rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `replace` method instead of the `test` method for the regular expression. This change would replace the first match of the pattern in the word, potentially causing incorrect pluralization or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
