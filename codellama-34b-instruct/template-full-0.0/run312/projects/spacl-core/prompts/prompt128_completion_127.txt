  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the code to access an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the code to miss important logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, potentially causing the code to miss important logic.

DONE.
