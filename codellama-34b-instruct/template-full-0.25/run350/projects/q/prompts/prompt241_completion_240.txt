  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` is the negation of `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise || isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise || isPromiseAlike` is a different condition than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation or behavior.

DONE.
