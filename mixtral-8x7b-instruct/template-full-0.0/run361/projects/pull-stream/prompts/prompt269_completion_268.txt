 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with an error if the stream ends, while this change would cause the callback to never be called if the stream ends, potentially causing the application to hang.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Stream ended')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with an error if the stream ends, but this change would cause the callback to be called with a specific error message, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the callback with an error if the stream ends, but this change would cause the callback to be called with the `end` value as the error, which might not be handled correctly by the calling code.

DONE.
