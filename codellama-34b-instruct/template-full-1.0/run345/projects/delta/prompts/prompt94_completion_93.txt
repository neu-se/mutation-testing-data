  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { bold: true };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an attribute to the newOp object, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'hello';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the insert property of the newOp object to a string with a specific value, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = 5;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the delete property of the newOp object to a specific value, which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
