  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `promises` array starting from the second element, instead of the original code which returns the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(["new promise"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new promise to the end of the `promises` array, instead of the original code which returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function(promise) { return promise.state === "fulfilled"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the promises that have been fulfilled, instead of the original code which returns all promises regardless of their state.

DONE.
