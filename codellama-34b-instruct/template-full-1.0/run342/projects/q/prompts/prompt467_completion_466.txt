  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.ogg("unhandledRejection", reason, deferred);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a built-in function in Node.js that allows you to emit an event on an event emitter, but `process.ogg` is not a valid function and would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code because `process.emit` is a built-in function in Node.js that allows you to emit an event on an event emitter, and the code fragment calls `process.emit` with the "unhandledRejection" event, `reason`, and `deferred` parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type++;
```
This would result in different behavior because `type++` is not a function and would increment the value of the `type` variable, which is not used in the code
