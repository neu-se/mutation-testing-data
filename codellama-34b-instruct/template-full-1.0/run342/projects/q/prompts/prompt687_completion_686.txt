  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` would be `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the resulting slice to exclude the first element of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` starting from the second one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.args` would be `undefined`, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `arguments` starting from the second one.

DONE.
