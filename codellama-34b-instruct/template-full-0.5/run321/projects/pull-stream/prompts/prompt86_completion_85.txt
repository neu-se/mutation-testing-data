  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if both `abort` and `cb` are truthy, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `abort` or `cb` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `abort` or `cb` is truthy, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if both `abort` and `cb` are truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `abort` or `cb` is truthy, while the new code fragment uses
