  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will close the write stream immediately, whereas `destroy()` will wait for any pending writes to complete before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` will close the write stream with an error, whereas `end()` will close the stream without an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => { throw new Error('Test error') })
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will close the write stream and then throw an error, whereas `destroy()` will close the stream without throwing an error.

DONE.
