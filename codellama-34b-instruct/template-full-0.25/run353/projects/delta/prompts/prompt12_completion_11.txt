  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `a[key]` value to be overwritten by `b[key]` even if `a[key]` is already defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `a[key]` to be overwritten by `b[key]` even if `b[key]` is undefined, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

a[key] === undefined || b[key] !== undefined

DONE.
