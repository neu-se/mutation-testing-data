  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different function than `isZero`, and it would return a different value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` is a different function than `isZero`, and it would return a different value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a different property than `isZero`, and it would return a different value for the same input.

DONE.
