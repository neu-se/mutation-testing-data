  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `value` as-is, while this alternative uses the value of `value` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `value` as-is, while this alternative uses the value of `value` multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `value` as-is, while this alternative uses the value of `value` minus 1.

DONE.
