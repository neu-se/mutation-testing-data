  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 300 is a valid status code for a successful response, but the original code only checked for status code 200.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked for status code 200, but this new code would also reject responses with status codes less than 200, such as 100 (Continue) or 304 (Not Modified).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode > 299
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checked for status code 200, but this new code would also reject responses with status codes greater than 299, such as 300 (Multiple Choices) or 404 (Not Found).
