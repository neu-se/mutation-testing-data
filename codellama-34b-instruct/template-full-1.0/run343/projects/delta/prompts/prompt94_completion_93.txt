  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new operation object into the `ops` array without checking if it is a valid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an empty object into the `ops` array, which is not a valid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an undefined value into the `ops` array, which is not a valid operation.

DONE.
