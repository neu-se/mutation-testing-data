  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined on the `Complex` class, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined on the `Complex` class, so it would create a new property on the `z` object with the value `true`.

DONE.
