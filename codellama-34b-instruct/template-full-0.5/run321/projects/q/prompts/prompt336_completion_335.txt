  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property is not defined in the `inspect` function, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property is not defined in the `inspect` function, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property is not defined in the `inspect` function, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
