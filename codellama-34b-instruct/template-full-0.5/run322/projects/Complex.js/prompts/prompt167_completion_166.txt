  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to always return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()` is true, instead of returning `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isZero']()` and `z['isZero']()` are both true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to always return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()` is true, instead of returning `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isZero']()` and `z['isZero']()` are both true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']
