  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks if a value is not not a number, which is always true if the value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is called on the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as calling it on the real part.

DONE.
