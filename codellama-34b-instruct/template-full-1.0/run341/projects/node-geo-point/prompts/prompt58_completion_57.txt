  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(Δλ)) / (cos(φ1) * cos(Δλ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the difference in latitude instead of the cosine, which would lead to a different result for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sin(φ2) - cos(φ1) * sin(Δλ)) / (cos(φ1) * cos(Δλ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the difference in latitude instead of the cosine, and then subtract the product of the cosine of the latitude of the first point and the sine of the difference in longitude, which would lead to a different result for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(sin(φ2) - cos(φ1) * cos(Δλ)) / (cos(φ1) * sin
