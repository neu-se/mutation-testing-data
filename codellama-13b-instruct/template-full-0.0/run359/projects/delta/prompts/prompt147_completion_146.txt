  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not specify a parameter for the `next()` method, while this code fragment specifies a parameter of `1`. This would cause the `next()` method to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
