  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'empty'
```
This would result in different behavior because the emitted event would be different from the original code. Instead of emitting a `'drain'` event, the mutated code would emit an `'empty'` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the emitted event would be different from the original code. Instead of emitting a `'drain'` event, the mutated code would emit a `'write'` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the emitted event would be different from the original code. Instead of emitting a `'drain'` event, the mutated code would emit an `'error'` event, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
