  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "rejected") {
    promise.exception = inspected.reason;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be evaluated to `false`, and the `promise.exception` property would not be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "pending" || inspected.state === "rejected") {
    return promise;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would not be executed if the condition is `true`, and the function would return a value instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspected.state === "pending" || inspected.state === "rejected") {
    throw new Error("Promise is not resolved");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed if the condition is `true`, and the
