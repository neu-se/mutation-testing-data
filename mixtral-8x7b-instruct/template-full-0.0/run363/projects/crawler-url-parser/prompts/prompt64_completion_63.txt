 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a subdomain of 'localhost' instead of using the `psl.parse` function to parse the host and extract the subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of using the `psl.parse` function to parse the host and extract the subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ domain: 'example.com', subdomain: '' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an object with a fixed `domain` and an empty `subdomain`, instead of using the `psl.parse` function to parse the host and extract the correct subdomain.

DONE.
