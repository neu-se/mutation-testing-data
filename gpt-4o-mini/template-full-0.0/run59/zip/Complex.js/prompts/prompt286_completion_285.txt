Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the imaginary part `b` to using the real part `a`, which alters the output of the cosine function for complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the imaginary part `b`, which would incorrectly affect the calculation of the cosine function, leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the imaginary part `b`, which would change the sign of the contribution of the imaginary part to the cosine calculation, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
