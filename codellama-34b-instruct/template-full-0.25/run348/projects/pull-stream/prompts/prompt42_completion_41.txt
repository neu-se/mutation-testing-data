  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it will not have the same properties and methods as the original `null` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it will not have the same properties and methods as the original `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and it will not have the same properties and methods as the original `null` value.

DONE.
