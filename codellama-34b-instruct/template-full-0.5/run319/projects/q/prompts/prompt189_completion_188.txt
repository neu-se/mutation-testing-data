  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"PLACEHOLDER"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a number, and the replaced code fragment is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a number, and the replaced code fragment is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a number, and the replaced code fragment is undefined.

DONE.
