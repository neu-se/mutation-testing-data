  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the fulfilled value, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the rejection reason, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.state;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the promise's state, regardless of the fulfillment value or rejection reason.

DONE.
