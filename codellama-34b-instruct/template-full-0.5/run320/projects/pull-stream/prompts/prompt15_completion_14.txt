  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `args` is `null`, while the modified code fragment checks if `args` is not `null`. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `args` is `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `args` is `null`, while the modified code fragment checks if the length of `args` is 0. This change would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `args` is an empty array, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `args` is `null`, while the modified code fragment
