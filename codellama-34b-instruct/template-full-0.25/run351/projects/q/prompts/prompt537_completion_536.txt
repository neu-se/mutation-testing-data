  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is truthy, while the new code fragment is checking if the value is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is truthy, while the new code fragment is checking if the value is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the value is truthy, while the new code fragment is checking if the value is falsy.

DONE.
