  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the queue, whereas `this._queue.get` returns the value associated with the given key in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.has` returns a boolean indicating whether the given key is present in the queue, whereas `this._queue.get` returns the value associated with the given key in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size` returns the number of elements in the queue, whereas `this._queue.get` returns the value associated with the given key in the queue.

DONE.
