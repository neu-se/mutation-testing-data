Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes == null || typeof attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the insertion of operations with null or non-object attributes, which would bypass the original check for valid attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && typeof attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow empty objects as valid attributes, contrary to the original intent of requiring at least one key in the attributes object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && typeof attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `Object.keys(attributes).length < 0` is always false, meaning that the attributes would never be added, regardless of their content.

DONE.
