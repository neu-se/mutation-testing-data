  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, while `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present, while `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` return the index of the occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new string, while `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` return the index of the occurrence.

DONE.
