  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would not be modified when the `untrackRejection` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the `unhandledRejections` array, omitting the last element, which would not be modified when the `untrackRejection` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `unhandledRejections` array, removing the first element, which would not be modified when the `untrackRejection` function is called.

DONE.
