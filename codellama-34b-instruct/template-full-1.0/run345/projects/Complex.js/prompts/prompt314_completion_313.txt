  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * b` would square the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `math.cos(a)` would calculate the cosine of the real part of the complex number, while `b` would not.

DONE.
