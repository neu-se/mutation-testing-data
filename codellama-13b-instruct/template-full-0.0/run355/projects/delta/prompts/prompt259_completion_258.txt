  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `insert` property of `otherOp` is being accessed instead of the `insert` property itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string or if it has a `length` property that is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `insert` property of `otherOp` is being called instead of the `insert` property itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string or if it does not have a `toString()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt()` method of the `insert` property of `otherOp`
