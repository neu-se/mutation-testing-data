 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict'; stackLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces the 'use strict' directive, which can change how the code is executed and potentially cause some parts of the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
stackLine + 'modified'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'modified' to the `stackLine` variable, which can cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.stackLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `stackLine` variable in the global scope (`window`), which can cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return a different result.

DONE.
