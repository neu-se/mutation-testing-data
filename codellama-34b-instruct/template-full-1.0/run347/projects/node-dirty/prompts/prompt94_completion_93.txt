  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is used to parse a JSON string, while `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { key, val } = JSON.parse(rowStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would destructure the parsed object into `key` and `val` variables, while the original code fragment does not use destructuring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rowObj = JSON.parse(rowStr);
rowObj.key = 'newKey';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `key` property of the parsed object to `'newKey'`, while the original code fragment does not modify the parsed object.

DONE.
