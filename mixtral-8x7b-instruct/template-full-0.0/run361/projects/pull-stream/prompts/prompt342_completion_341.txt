 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass the `abort` argument to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any arguments to the `cb` function, and this change would cause the `cb` function to receive a different argument value than it would in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(this, [abort])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function directly, while this change uses the `apply` method to call the function with a specific `this` value and an array of arguments. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
