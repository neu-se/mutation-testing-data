  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined && clearTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined && expr` will always return `undefined`, causing the timeout to not be cleared.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout >> 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout >> 1` will always return `0`, as `clearTimeout` returns a positive integer, which when right shifted by 1 will always result in `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => clearTimeout()
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => clearTimeout()` would create a new function that calls `clearTimeout` and immediately invoke it, causing the timeout to be cleared regardless of the parameter passed to the function.

DONE.
