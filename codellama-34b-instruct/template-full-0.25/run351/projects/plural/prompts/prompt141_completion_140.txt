  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` variable is a function that is not called in the original code fragment, so the resulting code would not produce the same output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[2]` variable is a function that is not called in the original code fragment, so the resulting code would not produce the same output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[3]` variable is a function that is not called in the original code fragment, so the resulting code would not produce the same output.

DONE.
