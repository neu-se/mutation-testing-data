Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `false` instead of `true`, which may lead to unexpected handling of the error case in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `i` is less than or equal to `max`, which would allow the callback to be called even when `i` is at the maximum value, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the callback would not provide a proper error message, which could lead to confusion or unhandled cases in the calling code.

DONE.
