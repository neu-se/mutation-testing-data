  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//.test(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test()` method to check if the string starts with `//`, but this new code fragment would check if the string ends with `//`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//.exec(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `test()` method to check if the string starts with `//`, but this new code fragment would use the `exec()` method to check if the string ends with `//`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string starts with `//`, but this new code fragment would check if the string starts with `http://` or `https://`.

DONE.
