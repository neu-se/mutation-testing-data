  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of `Array.isArray`, which would cause the `Delta` class to behave incorrectly when handling arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isnotArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for any value that is not an array, which would cause the `Delta` class to behave incorrectly when handling non-array values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.hasOwnProperty('isArray')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, which would cause the `Delta` class to behave incorrectly when handling arrays.

DONE.
