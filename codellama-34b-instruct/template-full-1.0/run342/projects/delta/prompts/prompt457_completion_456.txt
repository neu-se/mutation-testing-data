  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next` refers to the next element in the `ops` array, while `this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)` refers to the slice of the `ops` array starting from the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next` refers to the previous element in the `ops` array, while `this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)` refers to the slice of the `ops` array starting from the previous element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1, this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next` refers to the next element in the `ops` array, while `
