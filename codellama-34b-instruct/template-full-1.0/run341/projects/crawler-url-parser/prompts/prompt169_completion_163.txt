  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` variable is used to determine the level of nesting of the link URL relative to the page URL, and replacing it with `pageurl_path` would effectively flip the logic and determine the level of nesting of the page URL relative to the link URL instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` variable is a string, and replacing it with `linkurl.path` would return a `Path` object instead, which could potentially cause issues with the `split` method used later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl_path` variable is a string, and replacing it with `parseInt(linkurl_path)` would convert it to an integer, which could potentially cause issues with
