 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op ? op : data
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op` is falsy, it will return `data` instead of doing nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || data
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op` is falsy, it will return `data` instead of doing nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op !== undefined && op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op` is not defined, it will throw a `TypeError` instead of doing nothing.

DONE.
