  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would have caused the `flush` function to be passed as an argument to `setTimeout` instead of being called immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a timeout of 0, which would have caused `flush` to be called immediately, whereas this new code fragment would cause `flush` to be called after a delay of 1 millisecond.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { flush(); }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a timeout of 0, which would have caused `flush` to be called immediately, whereas this new code fragment would cause `flush` to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds, but within a new function scope.

DONE.
