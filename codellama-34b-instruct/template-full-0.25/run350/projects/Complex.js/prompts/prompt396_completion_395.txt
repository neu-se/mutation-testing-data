  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which returns the value of the variable `b`. Replacing it with `-b` would return the negative value of `b` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which returns the value of the variable `b`. Replacing it with `b + 1` would return the value of `b` plus 1 instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which returns the value of the variable `b`. Replacing it with `b * 2` would return the value of `b` multiplied by 2 instead.

DONE.
