  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete` would delete the current line, whereas `line.push` would push the current line onto the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain.delete` would delete the current retained region, whereas `line.push` would push the current line onto the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.delete` would delete the other delta, whereas `line.push` would push the current line onto the delta.

DONE.
