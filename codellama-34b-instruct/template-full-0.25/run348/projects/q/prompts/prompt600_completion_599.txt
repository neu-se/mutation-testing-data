  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `args` array, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument of the `args` array, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat(args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `args` array, along with the first element of the array, which would result in a duplicate value.

DONE.
