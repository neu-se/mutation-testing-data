  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement would check if it is not an object. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` more often, which could result in different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is not null, but this replacement would check if it is null. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` more often, which could result in different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is not undefined, but this replacement would check if it is not null. This would cause
