  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the function to block until the file is read, rather than returning a promise that resolves when the file is read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(fs)` is a bound version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the function to be called with the `fs` object as its `this` value, rather than being called with the global `fs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null)` is a bound version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the function to be called with `null` as its
