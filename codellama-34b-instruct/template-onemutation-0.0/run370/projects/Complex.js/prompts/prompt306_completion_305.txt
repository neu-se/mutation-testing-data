  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` as the second argument to `sinh()`, while the replaced code fragment uses `a`. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part, leading to different behavior in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
