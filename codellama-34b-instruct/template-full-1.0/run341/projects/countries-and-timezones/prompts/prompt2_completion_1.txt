  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap = data.countries[id] || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `tzMap` to an empty object instead of a map of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap = new Map(data.countries[id]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new map instance instead of using the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap = data.countries[id] || {};
tzMap.hasOwnProperty(id) || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the map has an own property with the key `id` instead of using the `in` operator.

DONE.
