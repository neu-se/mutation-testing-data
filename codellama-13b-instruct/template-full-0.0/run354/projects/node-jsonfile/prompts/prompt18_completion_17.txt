  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFile` function is asynchronous, while `fs.readFileSync` is synchronous. This could cause issues if the code relies on the synchronous behavior of `fs.readFileSync`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync` function is synchronous, while `fs.readFile` is asynchronous. This could cause issues if the code relies on the asynchronous behavior of `fs.readFile`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync` function is called with different arguments than the original code. This could cause issues if the code relies on the specific arguments being passed to `fs.readFileSync`.

DONE.
