  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the match condition for the rule, which would cause the rule to be applied incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the return value of the rule, which would cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the return value of the rule, which would cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

DONE.
