 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` check is replaced with a simple array index check, which doesn't take into account the `offset` property. This could lead to iterating past the actual end of the operations or stopping prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the operations array has any elements, rather than checking if the current operation has a non-infinite length. This would cause the iterator to return incorrect results or even enter an infinite loop if the first operation has infinite length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.peekLength() > 0
