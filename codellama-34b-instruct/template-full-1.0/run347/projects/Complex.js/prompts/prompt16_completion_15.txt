  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * y` would change the calculation of the hypotenuse, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)` would change the calculation of the hypotenuse, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hypot(x, y) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `hypot(x, y) / 2` would change the calculation of the hypotenuse, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
