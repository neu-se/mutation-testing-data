  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(promise) &&
                    (typeof snapshot === "undefined" || snapshot.state === "fulfilled")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `snapshot` variable is no longer checked for its `state` property, making the code always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(promise) &&
                    (snapshot = promise.inspect()).state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` check is negated, making the code always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(promise) &&
                    (snapshot = promise.inspect()).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the expected `fulfilled` state is changed to `rejected`, causing the code to return false when it should be true.

DONE.
