  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Failed to read from file'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate a failure to read from the file, causing the `error` event to be emitted with the given error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate a failure to write to the file, causing the `error` event to be emitted with no error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Failed to write to file')));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate a failure to write to the file, causing the `error` event to be emitted with the given error message.

DONE.
