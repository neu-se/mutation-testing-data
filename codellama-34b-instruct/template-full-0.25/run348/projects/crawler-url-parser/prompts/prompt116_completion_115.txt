  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to remove the `baseUrlStr` key from the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `for` loop to skip over the `baseUrlStr` key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to set the value of the `baseUrlStr` key to `null`, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the `baseUrlStr` key-value pair with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is used to remove all key-value pairs from the `urlMap` object, which would cause the `for` loop to not iterate over any key-value pairs
