  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This change will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to be called even if the `timezones` object already contains a property with the given `name`. This could potentially cause the `timezones` object to become out of sync with the `data.timezones` object, leading to unexpected behavior.
