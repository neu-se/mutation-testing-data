  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 1`, which would result in a substring of the original word, but using `w.length - 2` would result in a substring of the original word without the last character, which would be different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 1`, which would result in a substring of the original word, but using `w.length - 3` would result in a substring of the original word without the last two characters, which would be different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 1`, which would result in a substring of the original word, but using `w.length -
