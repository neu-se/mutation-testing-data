  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `makeNodeResolver` function is the `value` argument, not the `reason` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `makeNodeResolver` function is the `progress` argument, not the `reason` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument of the `makeNodeResolver` function is the `progress` argument, not the `reason` argument.

DONE.
