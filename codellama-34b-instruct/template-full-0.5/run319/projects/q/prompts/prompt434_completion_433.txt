This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called, which would add the promise and reason to the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays, even if the rejection is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections || unhandledRejections.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `trackRe
