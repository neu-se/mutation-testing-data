  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stackCounter
```
This change will cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to use the `stackCounter` property of the `p` object instead of the `stack` property, which may have different behavior depending on how the `p` object is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.length
```
This change will cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to use the length of the `stack` property of the `p` object instead of the `stack` property itself, which may have different behavior depending on how the `p` object is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, 10)
```
This change will cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to use a slice of the `stack` property of the `p` object instead of the `stack` property itself, which may have different behavior depending on how the `p` object is implemented.

DONE.
