  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is not being called with the correct number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with the incorrect second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with the incorrect second argument.

DONE.
