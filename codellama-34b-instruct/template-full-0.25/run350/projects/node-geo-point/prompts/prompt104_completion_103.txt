  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down. This would cause the x coordinate of the tile to be off by one for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down. This would cause the x coordinate of the tile to be off by one for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds one to the input value, causing the x coordinate of the tile to be off by one.

DONE.
