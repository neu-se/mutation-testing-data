  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `true` instead of `ended`, which may cause the test to pass even if the `ended` variable is not set to the correct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `ended` instead of `true`, which may cause the test to fail even if the `ended` variable is set to the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `end` instead of `ended`, which may cause the test to fail even if the `ended` variable is set to the correct value.

DONE.
