  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is expected to return a new Delta object with the contents of the current object and the `other` object concatenated, but with `null` it would return a new Delta object with only `null` as its content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is expected to return a new Delta object with the contents of the current object and the `other` object concatenated, but with `reverse` it would return a new Delta object with the contents of the `other` object reversed and concatenated with the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is expected to return a new Delta object with the contents of the current object and the `other` object concatenated,
