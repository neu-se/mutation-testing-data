  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the exponent to be one higher than it should be, resulting in a different value for `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the exponent to be one lower than it should be, resulting in a different value for `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the exponent to be twice as large as it should be, resulting in a different value for `x`.

DONE.
