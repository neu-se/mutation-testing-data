 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` refers to a global variable, if any, instead of the class-level `this.index`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs if a global variable with the same name exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `ops` array instead of the `index`. This would cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, as it would slice the `ops` array from the end, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
