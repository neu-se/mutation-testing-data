  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple variable reference, while the mutated code fragment is an addition operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple variable reference, while the mutated code fragment is a subtraction operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple variable reference, while the mutated code fragment is a multiplication operation.

DONE.
