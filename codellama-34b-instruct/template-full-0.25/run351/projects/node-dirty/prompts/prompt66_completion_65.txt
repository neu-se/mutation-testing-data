  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method would be called on the write stream, which would cause it to stop writing and emit a `finish` event, rather than the `destroy()` method being called, which would cause the stream to be destroyed and emit a `close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write()` method would be called on the write stream with an empty string, which would cause it to write an empty string to the file, rather than the `destroy()` method being called, which would cause the stream to be destroyed and emit a `close` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method would be called on the write stream with an error object, which would cause it to
