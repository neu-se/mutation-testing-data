 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.F_OK` checks if the file exists, regardless of whether it's readable or writable, while the original code checks if the file is both readable and writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.R_OK & ~fs.constants.W_OK
