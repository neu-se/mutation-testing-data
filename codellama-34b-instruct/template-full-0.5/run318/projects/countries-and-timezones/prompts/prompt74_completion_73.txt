  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an invalid argument, causing it to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a null argument, causing it to return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an undefined argument, causing it to return a different timezone object.

DONE.
