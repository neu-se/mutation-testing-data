  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
