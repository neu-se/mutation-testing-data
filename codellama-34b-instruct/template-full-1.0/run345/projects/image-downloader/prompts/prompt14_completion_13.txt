  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` will decode a URI, but it will not decode the path separators, whereas `decodeURIComponent` will decode the path separators, which is more likely to be the desired behavior in this scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURI(basename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` will encode a URI, but it will not encode the path separators, whereas `decodeURIComponent` will decode the path separators, which is more likely to be the desired behavior in this scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(path.dirname(pathname))
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(pathname)` will return the directory name of the file, whereas `path.basename(pathname)` will return the file name, which is more likely to be the desired behavior in this scenario.
