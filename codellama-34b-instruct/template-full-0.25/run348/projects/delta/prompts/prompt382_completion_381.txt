  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by one more step than the original code, potentially skipping over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to regress by one step than the original code, potentially repeating a previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by twice the length of the current operation, potentially skipping over multiple necessary operations.

DONE.
