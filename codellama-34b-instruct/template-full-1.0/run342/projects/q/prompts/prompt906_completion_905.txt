  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are not the same value, and the original code checks for `undefined` which means the callback might have been intentionally set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a more convoluted way of checking for `undefined`, but it is not the same as checking for `null` or any other falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the double equals signs (`==`) check for equality after coercing the types, so `callback == null` would return `true` if `callback` is `null` or `undefined`, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
