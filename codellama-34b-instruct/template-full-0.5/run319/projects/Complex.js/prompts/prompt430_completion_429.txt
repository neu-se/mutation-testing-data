  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity, whereas `Math.ceil` rounds towards positive infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds towards the nearest integer, whereas `Math.ceil` rounds towards positive infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.floor(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` to the rounded down value of `b`, whereas the original code fragment rounds `b` up to the nearest integer before adding it to `a`.

DONE.
