  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` was previously defined as a value, while `null` is a null object. This would cause the promise to reject with a null value, which would trigger the rejected callback with a null reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` was previously defined as a value, while `undefined` is a value that is not defined. This would cause the promise to reject with an undefined reason, which would trigger the rejected callback with an undefined reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` was previously defined as a value, while `0` is a falsy value. This would cause the promise to reject with a falsy reason, which would trigger the rejected callback with a falsy reason.

DONE.
