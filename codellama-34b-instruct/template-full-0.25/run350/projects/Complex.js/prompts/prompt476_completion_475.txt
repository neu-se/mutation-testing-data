  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` checks if a value is not finite, while `isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is finite, while `isFinite(this['im'])` checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is finite.

DONE.
