Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` computes the square root of a number, which can lead to incorrect results when `b` is negative or zero, as opposed to `Math.abs` which always returns a non-negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- b
```
This would result in different behavior because negating `b` would change its sign, potentially leading to incorrect logarithmic calculations, especially when `b` is positive, which would not be the case with `Math.abs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because squaring `b` would always yield a non-negative result, which could lead to incorrect logarithmic calculations, as it does not reflect the original intention of using the absolute value of `b`.

DONE.
