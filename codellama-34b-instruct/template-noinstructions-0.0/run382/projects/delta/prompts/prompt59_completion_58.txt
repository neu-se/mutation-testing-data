  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `ops` property of the `ops` object, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `ops` property of the `ops` property of the `ops` object, which is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.ops.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `ops` property of the `ops` property of the `ops` property of the `ops` object, which is not defined.

DONE.
