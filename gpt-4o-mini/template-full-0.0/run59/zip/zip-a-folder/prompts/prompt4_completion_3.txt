Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the compression level is not high, which would cause the code to execute the block intended for a different compression level instead of the default high compression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the medium compression level, which would lead to the code executing the block for medium compression, bypassing the uncompressed logic entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression > COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the compression level is greater than uncompressed, which would allow any compression level above uncompressed to execute the block, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the compression level is set to medium or high.

DONE.
