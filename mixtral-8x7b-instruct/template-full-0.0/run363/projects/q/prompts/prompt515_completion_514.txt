 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object would not be initialized properly, causing issues in the resolution or rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be used as the deferred object, which does not have the required `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` methods, causing issues in the proper handling of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
