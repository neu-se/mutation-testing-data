  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a different method name that is not defined in the code, so it would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post" + "get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of "post" and "get" would result in a different method name that is not defined in the code, so it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post" * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of "post" by 2 would result in a different method name that is not defined in the code, so it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
