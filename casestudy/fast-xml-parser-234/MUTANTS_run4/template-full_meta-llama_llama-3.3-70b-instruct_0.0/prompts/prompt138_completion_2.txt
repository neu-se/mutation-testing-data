Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a '0' to the end of the string instead of removing trailing zeros, potentially affecting downstream processing or comparisons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a '.' to the end of the string, which could alter the parsing or interpretation of the value in subsequent operations, especially if the value is used in numerical contexts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string representation of the value itself to the end, creating a significantly different string that could cause issues in parsing, comparisons, or other string operations, especially if the original value was not a string.

DONE.
