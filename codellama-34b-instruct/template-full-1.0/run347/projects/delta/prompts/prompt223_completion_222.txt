  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the two strings would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of characters, rather than a string, and the concatenation would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the number of characters in the string, rather than the string itself, and the concatenation would produce a different result.

DONE.
