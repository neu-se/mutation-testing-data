Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the `stackCounter` by 1, potentially leading to incorrect stack trace filtering as it would falsely indicate a higher stack depth than actually exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter - 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the `stackCounter` by 1, which could cause the filtering logic to miss relevant stack frames, resulting in incomplete or misleading stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: undefined, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `undefined`, which would break the logic that relies on `stackCounter` being a valid number, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect stack trace handling.

DONE.
