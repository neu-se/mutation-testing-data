  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
