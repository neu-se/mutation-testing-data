  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `sourceUrl` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls the `parse` function with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with a different set of options. The original code does not specify any options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, { removeDirectoryIndex: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with a different set of options. The original code specifies `removeDirectoryIndex: true`, but this change would set it to `false`.

DONE.
