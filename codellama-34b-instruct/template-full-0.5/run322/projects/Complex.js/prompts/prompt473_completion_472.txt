  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `true` for a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part, even if the real part is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `true` for a complex number with a non-zero real part, even if the imaginary part is finite.

DONE.
