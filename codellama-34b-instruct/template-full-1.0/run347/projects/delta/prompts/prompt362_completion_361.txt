  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method takes no arguments, so `length` would be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method takes no arguments, so `length` would be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextAll(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextAll()` method takes no arguments, so `length` would be ignored.

DONE.
