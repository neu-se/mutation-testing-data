Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the source file does not exist but the destination file does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.srcFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent property `srcFile` in the `options` object, which would cause a runtime error, unlike the original code that correctly uses the `srcFile` function parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destFile + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a temporary file with a different name, which might not be the intended file to check, potentially allowing the function to overwrite existing files without properly handling the `clobber` option.

DONE.
