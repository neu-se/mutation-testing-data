  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
