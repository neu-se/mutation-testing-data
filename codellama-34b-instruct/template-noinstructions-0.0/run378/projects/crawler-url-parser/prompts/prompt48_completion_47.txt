  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `//` in the URL to be treated as a path segment, rather than a protocol delimiter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter would cause the query string to be treated as a path segment, rather than a query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `//` in the URL to be treated as a protocol delimiter, rather than a path segment.

DONE.
