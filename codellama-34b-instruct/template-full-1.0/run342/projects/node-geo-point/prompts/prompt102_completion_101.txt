  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because λ2 is already in radians, and deg2rad() is called on it again, which would cause the result to be in the wrong units.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because φ2 is already in degrees, and rad2deg() is called on it again, which would cause the result to be in the wrong units.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 - 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because λ2 is already within the range of -180 to 180, and adding 180 and then taking the modulo of 360 would cause the result to be incorrect.

DONE.
