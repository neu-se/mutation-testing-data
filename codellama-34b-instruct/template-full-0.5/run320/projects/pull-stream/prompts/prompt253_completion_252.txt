  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that returns a chunk of data from the current stream. By replacing `nextChunk` with `nextStream`, the code would attempt to return a stream instead of a chunk of data, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a function that reads the current stream, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk of data from the current stream. By replacing `nextChunk` with `_read`, the code would attempt to read the current stream instead of the next chunk of data, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function that reads the current stream, whereas `nextChunk`
