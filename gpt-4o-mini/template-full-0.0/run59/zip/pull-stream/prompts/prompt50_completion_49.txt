Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `s` is a string instead of a function, which would cause the code to skip the function call and potentially lead to unexpected results when `s` is actually a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `s` is null, which would cause the code to treat null values differently and potentially skip the function call, leading to incorrect handling of valid function inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original check, causing the code to execute the function call when `s` is not a function, which could lead to runtime errors or incorrect processing of the input.

DONE.
