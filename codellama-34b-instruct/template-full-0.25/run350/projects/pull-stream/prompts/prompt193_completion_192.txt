  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression `aborted && false` would first evaluate to `false` if `aborted` is `true`, and then the `!` operator would negate the result to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression `aborted || true` would first evaluate to `true` if `aborted` is `false`, and then the `!` operator would negate the result to `
