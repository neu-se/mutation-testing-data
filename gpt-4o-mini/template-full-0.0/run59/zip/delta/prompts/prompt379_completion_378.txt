Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next().retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly retains the data from the `otherIter` instead of pushing the `otherOp` to the `delta`, which may lead to loss of the intended insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which would result in the wrong operation being added to `delta`, potentially altering the intended transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherIter.next().delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the operation from `otherIter` instead of pushing it to `delta`, which would lead to a loss of data that should have been retained in the transformation.

DONE.
