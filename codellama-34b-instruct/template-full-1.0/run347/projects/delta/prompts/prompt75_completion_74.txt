  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<object>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code was using the spread operator to create a shallow copy of an object, but now it would create a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<array>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code was using the spread operator to create a shallow copy of an array, but now it would create a deep copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<new Object()>
```
This would result in different behavior because the code was using the `Object.assign()` method to create a shallow copy of an object, but now it would create a new object with the same properties.

DONE.
