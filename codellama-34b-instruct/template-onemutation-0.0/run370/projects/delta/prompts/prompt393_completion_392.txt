  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `otherIter.next()` calls the function and returns the result of the function, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
