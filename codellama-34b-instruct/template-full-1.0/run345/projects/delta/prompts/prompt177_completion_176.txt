  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` method returns the length of the current op in the iterator, so `otherIter.peekLength + 1` would return the length of the next op instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.count + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.count` property returns the number of ops in the iterator, so `otherIter.count + 1` would return the number of ops plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekLength()` method returns the length of the current op in the iterator, but `null` is not a valid op length.

DONE.
