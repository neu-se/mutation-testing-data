 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable would be passed directly instead of an array containing the `name` variable and `nodeArgs`. This would cause issues in the `dispatch` method, as it expects an array with two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable would be passed directly instead of an array containing the `name` variable and `nodeArgs`. This would cause issues in the `dispatch` method, as it expects an array with two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[, nodeArgs]
