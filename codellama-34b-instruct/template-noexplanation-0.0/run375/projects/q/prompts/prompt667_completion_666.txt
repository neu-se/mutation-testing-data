  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This change will cause the `array_slice` function to start from the second argument instead of the first, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This change will cause the `array_slice` function to start from the first argument instead of the second, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This change will cause the `array_slice` function to start from the last argument instead of the second, which may cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
