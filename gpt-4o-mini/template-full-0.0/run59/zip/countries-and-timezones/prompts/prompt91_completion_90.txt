Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone(tzName, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a country for the given timezone instead of directly getting the country associated with the provided country ID, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `getCountry` with the `id` variable instead of the `countryId`, which may not correspond to the intended country, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `null`, regardless of the input, effectively breaking the intended functionality of retrieving the country associated with the given ID.

DONE.
