  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method sorts the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

DONE.
