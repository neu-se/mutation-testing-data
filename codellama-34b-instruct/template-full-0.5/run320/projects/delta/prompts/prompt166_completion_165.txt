  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the length of the current op is greater than the remaining length of the first op in the other delta, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the length of the current op is equal to the remaining length of the first op in the other delta, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() == firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if the length of the current op is equal to the remaining length of the first op in the other delta, leading to a potential infinite loop if the lengths are equal but the ops are not equal.

DONE.
