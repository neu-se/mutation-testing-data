  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the `Q.try` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array_slice(arguments, 1), void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the arguments starting from the second one, which could affect the behavior of the `Q.try` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array_slice(arguments, 1), arguments[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the arguments starting from the second one, but the first argument would still be passed to the `Q.try` method.

DONE.
