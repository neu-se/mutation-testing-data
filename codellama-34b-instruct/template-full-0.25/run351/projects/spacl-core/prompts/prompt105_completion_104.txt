  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the name, which would cause the query to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the name to uppercase, which would cause the query to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the name, which would cause the query to return a different result.

DONE.
