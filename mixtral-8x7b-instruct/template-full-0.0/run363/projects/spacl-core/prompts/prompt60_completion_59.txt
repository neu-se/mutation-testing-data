 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finalise()'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly call the `finalise` function as a method, rather than using its return value as the regex string. This would cause the compiled regex to include the literal string "finalise()" in its pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'+finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend a forward slash to the compiled regex pattern, changing the meaning of the pattern and potentially causing it to fail to match any strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the string representation of the `finalise` function as the regex pattern, rather than the actual pattern returned by the function. This would likely cause the compiled regex to fail to match any strings.

DONE.
