  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator checks if the value is of a certain type, and the value of resolver may not be a string but still be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver != "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the == operator checks if the value is equal to a certain value, and the value of resolver may not be a string but still be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(resolver) != "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator checks if the value is of a certain type, and the value of resolver may not be a string but still be a function.

DONE.
