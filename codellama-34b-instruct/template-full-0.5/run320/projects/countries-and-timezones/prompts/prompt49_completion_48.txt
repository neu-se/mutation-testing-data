  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only iterate over the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code fragment iterates over all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.timezones).forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the timezones object, whereas the original code fragment iterates over the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).forEach(tz => console.log(tz))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the keys of the timezones object to the console, whereas the original code fragment does not have any side effects.

DONE.
