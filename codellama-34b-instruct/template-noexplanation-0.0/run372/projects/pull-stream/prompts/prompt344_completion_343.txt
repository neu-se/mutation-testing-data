  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the logical AND operator instead of the conditional operator. This change will not affect the behavior of the code, but it will make the test suite more effective by testing the `onAbort` function with different values of `abort`.
