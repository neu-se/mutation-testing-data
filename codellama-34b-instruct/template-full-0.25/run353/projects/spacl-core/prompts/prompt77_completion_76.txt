  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which could cause the `matches()` method to return a different result.

DONE.
