  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior from the original code element because the `push` method is not defined, which would throw a "push is not a function" error at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.push
```
This would result in different behavior from the original code element because `otherIter.push` is defined and different from `delta.push`. In this case, however, `otherIter.push` is not a method, so it would not throw a "push is not a function" error. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior from the original code element because a negation operator (!) makes. Therefore the result's value is reversed
