  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This change will cause the `s.sink` method to be called instead of the `s.source` method, which may have unintended consequences in the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This change will cause the `s.sink` method to be called with the `read` argument, which may have unintended consequences in the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read, s.source)
```
This change will cause the `s.sink` method to be called with the `read` argument and the `s.source` method as arguments, which may have unintended consequences in the program's behavior.

DONE.
