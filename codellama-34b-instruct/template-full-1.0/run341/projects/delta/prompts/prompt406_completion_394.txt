  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "embedType + '_BUG'".

This would result in different behavior because the logic in the `transform` method assumes that the `embedType` value is a valid embed type and uses it to retrieve the corresponding embed handler from the `Delta` object. By adding a suffix to the `embedType` value, the logic would crash when trying to retrieve the non-existent embed handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "embedType + ''".

This would result in different behavior because the logic in the `transform` method assumes that the `embedType` value is a string and uses it to retrieve the corresponding embed handler from the `Delta` object. By concatenating an empty string to the `embedType` value, it would result in an invalid embed handler being retrieved, causing the code to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "embedType + 'KEY'".

This would result in different behavior because the logic in the `transform` method assumes that the `embedType` value is a string and
