  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable, which could have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b`, which could change the result of the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `c` variable instead of the `b` variable, which could have a different value.

DONE.
