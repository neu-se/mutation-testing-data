  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "https://". This could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the "https" protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "ftp://". This could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the "ftp" protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ws://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "ws://". This could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the "ws" protocol
