  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument `urlToRun` would be set to false, which would prevent the parsed URL from being run.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `useBaseUrl` would be set to false, which would prevent the base URL from being used when resolving relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second and third arguments `urlToRun` and `useBaseUrl` would be set to true, which would allow the parsed URL to be run and the base URL to be used when resolving relative URLs.

DONE.
