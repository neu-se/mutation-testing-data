  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a function that returns a string, while `otherIter.peekType()` calls the function and returns its return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the next operation, while `otherIter.peek` returns the next operation itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next().type` returns the type of the next operation, while `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

DONE.
