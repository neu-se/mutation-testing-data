  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would therefore cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would therefore cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would therefore cause a reference error.

DONE.
