  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink = read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `read` function to the `sink` property of the `s` object, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method of the `s` object with the `read` function as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read, read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method of the `s` object with the `read` function as both arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
