  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(1)` returns a new string that is a substring of `content`, starting from the second character. In contrast, `content.toString` returns the string representation of the `content` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `content[0]` returns the first character of `content`, whereas `content.toString` returns the string representation of the `content` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.length` returns the length of `content`, whereas `content.toString` returns the string representation of the `content` object.

DONE.
