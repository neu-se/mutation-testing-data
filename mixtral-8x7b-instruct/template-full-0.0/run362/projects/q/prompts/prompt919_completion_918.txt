 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Buggy timeout"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a buggy function that throws an error is used instead of the original deferred.makeNodeResolver(). This would cause tests to fail when the error is thrown, indicating that the error handling in the test suite needs to be improved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
