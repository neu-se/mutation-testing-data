  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the query string, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL contains query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the hostname, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL contains a hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter would cause the `URL.parse` method to parse the query string and hostname, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL contains a query string or hostname that is not properly formatted.

DONE.
