  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `false` even if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `true` even if `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `true` if `end` is falsy, and `false` if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
