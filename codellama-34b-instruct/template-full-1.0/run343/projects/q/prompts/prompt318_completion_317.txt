  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new empty object instead of inheriting from the prototype of the `Promise` constructor function, which would break the chaining of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Function()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new empty function instead of inheriting from the prototype of the `Promise` constructor function, which would break the chaining of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.get()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the same method reference for all objects, which would break the ability to distinguish between different promises. DONE.
