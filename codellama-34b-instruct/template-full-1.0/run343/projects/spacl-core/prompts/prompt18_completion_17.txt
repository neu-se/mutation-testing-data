  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.slice(0, -1)` would return a string that is one character shorter than `spec`, which could cause the regular expression to not match the full path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/([a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.])/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.replace(/([a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.])/g, '')` would remove all instances of the characters in the regular expression from `spec`, which could cause the regular expression to not match the full path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.split('/').slice(-1)[0]` would return the last segment of the path, which could cause the regular expression to not match the
