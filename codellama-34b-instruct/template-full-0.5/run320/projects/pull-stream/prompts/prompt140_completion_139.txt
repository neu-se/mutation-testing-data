  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and the result of `generate()`, whereas the original code only called `cb` with one argument, `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with one argument, the result of `generate()`, whereas the original code called `cb` with two arguments, `null` and the result of `generate()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate(end))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and the result of `generate(end)`, whereas the original code called `cb` with two arguments, `null` and the result of `generate()`.

DONE.
