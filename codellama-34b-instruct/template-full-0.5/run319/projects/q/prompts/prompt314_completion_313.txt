  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method returns a rejected promise, while the original code fragment `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves to the first of an array of promises to become settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` method returns a promise that resolves to the given value, while the original code fragment `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves to the first of an array of promises to become settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` method returns a promise that resolves to an array of values, while the original code fragment `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves to the first of an array of promises to become settled.

DONE.
