Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect operations being performed on the `retDelta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length returned by `thisIter.peekLength`, which could cause an off-by-one error in the number of operations processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length returned by `thisIter.peekLength`, which could lead to processing more operations than intended, potentially causing data corruption or unexpected results.

DONE.
