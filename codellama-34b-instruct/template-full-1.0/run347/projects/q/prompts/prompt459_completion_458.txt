  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the promise to the `unhandledRejections` array even if it has already been handled, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.concat(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the promise to the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
