  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```regex.lastIndex = 0```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be reset, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```w.slice(-2) + 'es'```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be searching for a different pattern in the input string, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```w.split('').reverse().join('')```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be reversing the input string, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
