  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a standalone instance method, while `isPromise` is a static method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isPromise(value.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `promise` property of `value` is a promise, while `isPromise` checks if `value` itself is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.name === "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the name of the constructor function of `value`, which may not always be "Promise".

DONE.
