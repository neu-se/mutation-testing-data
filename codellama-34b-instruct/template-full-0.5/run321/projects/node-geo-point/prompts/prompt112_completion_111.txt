  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.tan` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.tan` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `Math.tan` is a function that returns the tangent of a number.

DONE.
