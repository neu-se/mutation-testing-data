  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if the length is less than 0. This means that if the length is equal to 0, the original code fragment would return true, while this new code fragment would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if the length is greater than 0. This means that if the length is equal to 0, the original code fragment would return true, while this new code fragment would return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment only checks if
