  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x) => x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this function adds 1 to its input, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
