 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `ops` array instead of the nested `ops` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first element of the `ops` array, instead of the nested `ops` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new array containing all the elements of the `ops` array, instead of accessing the nested `ops` property.

DONE.
