  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that calls a function asynchronously, while `Q` is a promise library. Using `Q.fcall` instead of `Q` would cause the callback to be called asynchronously, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, while `Q` is a promise library. Using `Q.resolve` instead of `Q` would cause the callback to be called with the resolved value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason
