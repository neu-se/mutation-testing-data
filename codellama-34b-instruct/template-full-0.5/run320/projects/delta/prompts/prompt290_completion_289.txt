  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` is a function that advances the iterator to the next element, while `iter.next()` is a function call that returns the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(1)` advances the iterator by 1 element, while `iter.next()` advances it to the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` advances the iterator by 2 elements, while `iter.next()` advances it to the next element.

DONE.
