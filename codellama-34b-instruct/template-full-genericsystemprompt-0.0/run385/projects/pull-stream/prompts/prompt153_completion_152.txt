  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator adds 1 to the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator multiplies the `abort` variable by 2, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value.

DONE.
