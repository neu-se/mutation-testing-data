  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different index, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different index, which could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a different index, which could potentially return a different value.

DONE.
