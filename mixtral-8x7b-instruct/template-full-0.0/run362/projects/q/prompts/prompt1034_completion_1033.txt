 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine = 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qEndingLine` variable is being reassigned to a number instead of capturing the line number. This change will prevent proper stack traces if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine = Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qEndingLine` variable is being reassigned to the `Q` object instead of capturing the line number. This change will affect stack traces if an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` object is being deleted, which would cause errors in any code that relies on it. This change would expose the lack of error handling in the test suite.

DONE.
