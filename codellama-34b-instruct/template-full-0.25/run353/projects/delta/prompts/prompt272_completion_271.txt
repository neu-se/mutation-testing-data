  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more elements in the iterator, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop if there are more elements in the iterator and the next element is not an insert operation, which would cause the loop to skip over any insert operations in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop if there are more elements in the iterator and the next element is not a delete operation, which would cause the loop to skip over any delete operations in the iterator.

DONE.
