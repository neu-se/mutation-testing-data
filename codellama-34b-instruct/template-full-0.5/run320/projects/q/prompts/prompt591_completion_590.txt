  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved. Replacing it with `none` would cause the code to fail because `none` is not a valid function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects all of the promises in an array to resolve, while `some` expects at least one of them to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` expects all of the promises in an array to resolve, while `any` expects any one of them to resolve.

DONE.
