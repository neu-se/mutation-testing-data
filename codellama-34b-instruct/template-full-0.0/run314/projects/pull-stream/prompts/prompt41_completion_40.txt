  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is a different method than `pull.apply`, and it has a different behavior when it comes to handling the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` returns a new function that is bound to the `this` context, whereas `pull.apply` and `pull.call` do not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `this` context to the `pull` function, whereas the original code passes `read` as the `this` context.

DONE.
