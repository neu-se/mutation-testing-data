Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `true` instead of the actual `aborted` value, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the callback instead of the `aborted` value, which could lead to the consumer of the callback not being aware that an abort condition has occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the error object to the callback instead of the `aborted` value, which could mislead the caller into thinking an error occurred rather than an abort condition.

DONE.
