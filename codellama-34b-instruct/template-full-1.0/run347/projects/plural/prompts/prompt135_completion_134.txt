  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + word
```
This would result in a different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string "1" with the `word` variable, instead of adding 1 to the number represented by the `word` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + "abc"
```
This would result in a different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `word` variable with the string "abc", instead of adding 1 to the number represented by the `word` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because the `+` operator would not work with a string and a number, which would cause a type error.

DONE.
