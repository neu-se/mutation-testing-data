  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a valid value, but `null` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a valid value, but `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a valid value, but `{}` (an empty object) would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value than expected.

DONE.
