  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is replaced with a simple arithmetic expression that always returns `2`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is now being called with the `dispatch` method instead of the `promiseDispatch` method, and the `set` method is being called with the index `1` instead of the `key` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", []);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is now being called with an empty array as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would result in an error.

DONE.
