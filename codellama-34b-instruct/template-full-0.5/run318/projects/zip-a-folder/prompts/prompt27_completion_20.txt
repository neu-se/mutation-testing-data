  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is a method that turns off the output stream, whereas `output.on` is a method that turns on the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` is a method that emits an event, whereas `output.on` is a method that listens for an event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.pipe` is a method that pipes the output stream to another stream, whereas `output.on` is a method that listens for an event.

DONE.
