  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator is applied to `b`, which would negate the value of `b` and cause the `Math.sin()` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because a value of `1` is added to `b`, which would cause the `Math.sin()` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is multiplied by `2`, which would cause the `Math.sin()` function to return a different result.

DONE.
