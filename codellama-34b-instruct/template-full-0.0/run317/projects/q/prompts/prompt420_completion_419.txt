  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, and the `state` property is a string that can be either "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending".

```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, and the `state` property is a string that can be either "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending". By comparing the `state` property to the string "fulfilled", the code is checking whether the promise has been resolved, meaning it has been fulfilled with a value.

Option 3: The
