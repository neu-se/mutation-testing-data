  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `shouldThrow`, so the error would be thrown even if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is truthy, so the error would never be thrown if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is falsy, so the error would never be thrown if `shouldThrow` is `true`.

DONE.
