  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from index 1 and ending at index 2, which would be a subset of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from index 1 and ending at index 3, which would be a subset of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from index 1 and ending at index 4, which would be a subset of the original array.

DONE.
