  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in an error, as `void` is not a valid value for `φ1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in an error, as `null` is not a valid value for `φ1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function {}
```
This would result in different behavior, as `function {}` is not a valid value for `φ1`.

DONE.
