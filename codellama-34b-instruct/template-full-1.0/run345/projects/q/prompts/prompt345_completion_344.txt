  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `reject`, and would change the control flow of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that raises an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would cause the function to exit early, whereas `reject` would continue executing the rest of the function.

DONE.
