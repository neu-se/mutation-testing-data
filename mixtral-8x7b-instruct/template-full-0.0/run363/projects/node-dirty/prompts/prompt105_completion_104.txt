 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would be `undefined` when the value is not present in the row, instead of throwing an error for missing property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'constant_key'
