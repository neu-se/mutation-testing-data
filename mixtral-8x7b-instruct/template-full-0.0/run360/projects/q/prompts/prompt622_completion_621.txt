 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is returned instead of an array with the key and value. This change will affect the behavior of the code that relies on the returned array, such as the `set` method implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is returned instead of an array with the key and value. This change will affect the behavior of the code that relies on the returned array, such as the `set` method implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[value, key]
