Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to the imaginary part instead of checking if either part is NaN, which would incorrectly indicate that a complex number is not NaN when it actually is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is zero, which would incorrectly indicate that a complex number is not NaN when the real part could still be NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is not finite instead of checking if it is NaN, which would lead to false negatives for complex numbers that have NaN as their real or imaginary part.

DONE.
