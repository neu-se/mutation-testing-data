  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would cause the `_flush` method to be called with an invalid argument, which could potentially result in a runtime error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._queue.size` argument would cause the `_flush` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could potentially result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._data.size` argument would cause the `_flush` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could potentially result in a different outcome.

DONE.
