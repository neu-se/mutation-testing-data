  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` as the first element of the array, instead of the original code which uses `null` as the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0` as the first element of the array, instead of the original code which uses `null` as the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Infinity` as the first element of the array, instead of the original code which uses `null` as the first element.

DONE.
