  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous token instead of the next token, potentially causing the parser to misinterpret the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the token after the next token instead of the next token, potentially causing the parser to misinterpret the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the token after the token after the next token instead of the next token, potentially causing the parser to misinterpret the input.

DONE.
