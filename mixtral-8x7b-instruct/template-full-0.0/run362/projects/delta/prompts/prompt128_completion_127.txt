 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would start iterating from the beginning of the operations array, regardless of the `start` parameter value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would start iterating from a position that is the sum of the `start` parameter and the current `index`, which may lead to skipping some elements or iterating beyond the array bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would always start iterating from a position that is the absolute difference between the `start` parameter and the current `index`, which may lead to iterating in the wrong direction or skipping elements.

DONE.
