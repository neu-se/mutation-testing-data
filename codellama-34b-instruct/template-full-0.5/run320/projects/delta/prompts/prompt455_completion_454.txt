  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `ops` array, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the previous element of the `ops` array, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index, this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include only the first element of the `ops` array, which may not be intended.

DONE.
