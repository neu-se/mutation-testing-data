Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to parse the `baseUrlStr` as a URL instead of using the parsed base URL from the previous logic, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the `baseUrlStr` entirely, which could lead to incorrect parsing of relative URLs, as it would treat them as absolute URLs without a base.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `baseUrl.url` instead of `baseUrl`, which may lead to incorrect URL parsing if `baseUrl` is an object and not a string, potentially causing runtime errors or incorrect URL resolutions.

DONE.
