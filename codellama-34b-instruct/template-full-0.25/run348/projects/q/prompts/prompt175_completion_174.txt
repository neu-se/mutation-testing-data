  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the order of the lines to be reversed, which could potentially change the meaning of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the `desiredLines` array, which could potentially remove a line that is important to the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["new line"]).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add a new line to the `desiredLines` array, which could potentially change the meaning of the stack trace.

DONE.
