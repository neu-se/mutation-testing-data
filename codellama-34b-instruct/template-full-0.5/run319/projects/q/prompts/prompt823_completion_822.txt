  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than the original error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message, rather than the original error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the same error message as the original code, but it would be a different error object.

DONE.
