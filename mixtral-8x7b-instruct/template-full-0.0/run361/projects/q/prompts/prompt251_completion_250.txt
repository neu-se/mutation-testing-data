 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` property would always be set to `undefined`, even when long stacks are enabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` property would always be set to the `newPromise`, even when long stacks are disabled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `source` property to be set to the `newPromise` regardless of the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`.

DONE.
