  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("test error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of `object.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)`, while this replacement code fragment rejects the promise with a new error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of `object.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)`, while this replacement code fragment resolves the promise with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of `object.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, op, args)`, while this replacement code fragment resolves the promise with the `op` argument.

DONE.
