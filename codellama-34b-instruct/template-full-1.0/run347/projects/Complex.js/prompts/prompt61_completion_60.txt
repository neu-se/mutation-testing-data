  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `parser_exit()` function to be called when the argument is finite, rather than when it is not finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2+Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 2 to the result of the `Number.isFinite` function, which would cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called when the argument is not finite, rather than when it is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a) || Number.isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `a` or `b` is finite, rather than checking if both are not finite.

DONE.
