  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `transformPosition` function to return a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `transformPosition` function to return a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `transformPosition` function to return a different index.

DONE.
