  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.isBuffer` method returns `true` if the argument is a buffer, and `false` otherwise. By replacing it with `Buffer.isBuffer(content) === false`, we are essentially inverting the condition, so the code will only execute if `content` is not a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf8') !== 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method with the `'utf8'` encoding returns a string representation of the buffer in UTF-8 encoding. By comparing the result to the string `'utf8'`, we are essentially checking if the buffer is not in UTF-8 encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a buffer returns the number of bytes in the buffer. By
