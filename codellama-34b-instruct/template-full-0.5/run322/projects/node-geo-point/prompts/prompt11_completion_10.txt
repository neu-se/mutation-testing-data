  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the string "coordinatesfoo" in the object, rather than just "coordinates".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the string "coordinatescoordinates" in the object, rather than just "coordinates".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for the presence of the string "c" in the object, rather than just "coordinates".

DONE.
