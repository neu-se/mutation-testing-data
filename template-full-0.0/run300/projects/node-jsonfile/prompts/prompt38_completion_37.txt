  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, but `fs.writeFile` does not take a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, but `fs.writeFileSync` does not take a callback.

DONE.
