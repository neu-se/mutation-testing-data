  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => console.log(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs each operation to the console instead of applying it to the current delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.insert = 'dummy text');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the insert attribute of each operation, which affects how the delta is applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => op.delete = 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delete attribute of each operation, which affects how the delta is applied.

DONE.
