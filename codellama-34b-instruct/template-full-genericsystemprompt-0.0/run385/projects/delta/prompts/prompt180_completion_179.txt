  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of characters to retain, and adding 1 to it would cause the retain operation to retain one more character than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of characters to retain, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the retain operation to retain one fewer character than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to determine the number of characters to retain, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the retain operation to retain twice as many characters as intended.

DONE.
