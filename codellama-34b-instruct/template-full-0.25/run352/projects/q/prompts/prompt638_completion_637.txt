  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would likely cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would likely cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string with the value "key" as the second argument to `dispatch`, which would likely cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
