  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejectionHandled = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejectionHandled` flag would be set, even if the rejection was not handled by the process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` count would be reset, even if there were still unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` count would be reset, even if there were still unhandled rejections.

DONE.
