  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `reject` function would not be called with any argument, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `reject` function would not be called with any argument, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Some error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and passed to the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code.

DONE.
