  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/abc/g, "123");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of "abc" in the string with "123", whereas the original code only checked if the string contains "abc".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.slice(0, 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the first three characters of the string, whereas the original code checked for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.indexOf("abc") == 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the substring "abc" is at the beginning of the string, whereas the original code checked for the presence of the substring "abc" anywhere in the string.

DONE.
