  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range and output than the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function has a different range and output than the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is multiplied by 2, which would change the output values.

DONE.
