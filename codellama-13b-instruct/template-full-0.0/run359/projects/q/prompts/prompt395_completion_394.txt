  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { throw value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment throws the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return Q(value); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the promise, while the new code fragment returns a new promise that resolves to the value.

DONE.
