  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always add the new text to the existing text, regardless of whether it already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text !== text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only add the new text if it is different from the existing text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.split(" ").includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only add the new text if it is a separate word from the existing text.

DONE.
