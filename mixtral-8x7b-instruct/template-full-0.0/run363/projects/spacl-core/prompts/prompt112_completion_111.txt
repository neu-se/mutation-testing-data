 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the keys of the `verbs` object instead of the `verbs` array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the values of the `verbs` object, which may cause issues if the order of the verbs is important.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const [verb] of Object.entries(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the key-value pairs of the `verbs` object, which may not be compatible with the expected usage of the `allow` method.

DONE.
