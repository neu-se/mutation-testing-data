  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise's state, while `inspect()` would return the value of the `inspect` property of the `promise` object, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise's state, while `promise.inspect()` would return the value of the `inspect` property of the `promise` object, which is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect.state` is a property that contains the state of the promise, while `promise.inspect()` would return the value of the `inspect` property of the
