  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, even if the input string contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str);
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is negated, so the function would return `true` if the input string contains any illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return str.includes(' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if the input string contains a space character, regardless of whether it contains any other illegal characters.

DONE.
