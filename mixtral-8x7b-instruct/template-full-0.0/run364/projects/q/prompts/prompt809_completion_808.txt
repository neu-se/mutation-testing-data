 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback === null || typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `callback` as `null` as a falsy value, while the original code only treats it as falsy if it is actually `null` or if `callback.apply` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || typeof callback.call !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `callback.call` instead of `callback.apply`, which would cause the `finally` callback to be called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback || typeof callback.apply !== "function" && callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it also checks if `callback` is equal to `undefined`, which would cause the `finally` callback to be called even if `callback` is not defined.

DONE.
