  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an exception to be thrown, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise, which would not happen with the original code fragment.

DONE.
