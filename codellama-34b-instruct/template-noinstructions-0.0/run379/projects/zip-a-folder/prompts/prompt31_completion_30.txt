  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` would turn off the event listener for the `close` event, which would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be called whenever the `error` event is emitted, but it would not reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called whenever the `error` event is emitted, which would reject the promise.

DONE.
