  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is truthy or falsy, while `country === null` checks if the `country` variable is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is truthy or falsy, while `country === undefined` checks if the `country` variable is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is truthy or falsy, while `country.length === 0` checks if the `country` variable is an empty string or an empty array.

DONE.
