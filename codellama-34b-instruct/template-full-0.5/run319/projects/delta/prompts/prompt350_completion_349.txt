  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert()` method returns a new `AttributeMap` object with the inverted attributes, rather than modifying the existing `AttributeMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete()` method removes the `attributes` property from the `op` object, which could cause errors in the subsequent code that uses the `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method removes all the attributes from the `AttributeMap` object, which could cause errors in the subsequent code that uses the `attributes` property.

DONE.
