  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` function would retrieve the `tail` instead of the `head` property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` function would retrieve the `fail` property of the `tail` instead of the `head` property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` function would retrieve the `tail` property of the `closed.promise` promise instead of the `head` property of the object returned by `ends.promise.get()`.

DONE.
