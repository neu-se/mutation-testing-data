  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return `false` in cases where it should return `true`, which could lead to errors in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return `true` in cases where it should return `false`, which could lead to errors in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext =
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return `undefined` in cases where it should return a boolean value, which could lead to errors in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
