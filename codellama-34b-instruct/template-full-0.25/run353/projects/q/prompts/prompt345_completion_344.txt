  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that interrupts the normal flow of control and immediately raises an exception, whereas `reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `return reject(new Error("rejected"))` returns a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `reject` returns a rejected promise with no error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("rejected"))` returns a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `reject` returns a rejected promise with no error message.

DONE.
