Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the object is null, but not if it's undefined, and also doesn't consider the case where the object has a '$class' property with a string value and a '$' property with a null or undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
is.nullOrUndefined(obj.$) || (is.string(obj.$class) && obj === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the '$' property of the object is null or undefined, instead of the object itself, and also incorrectly checks if the object is null when it has a '$class' property with a string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!is.object(obj) || (is.string(obj.$class) && !is.object(obj.$))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is not an object, instead of checking if it's null or undefined, and also checks if the '$' property is not an object when the object has a '$class' property with a
