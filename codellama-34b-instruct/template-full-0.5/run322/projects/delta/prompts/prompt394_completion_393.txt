  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return `undefined`, which would lead to a runtime error when trying to access the `retain` property of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return `null`, which would lead to a runtime error when trying to access the `retain` property of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return `NaN`, which would lead to a runtime error when trying to access the `retain` property of `NaN`.

DONE.
