This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "fulfilled" regardless of the promise's state, which would cause the `valueOf` method to always return the promise's value, even if the promise is rejected.

```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "pending" regardless of the promise's state, which would cause the `valueOf` method to always return the promise's value, even if the
