  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the arcus cotangent implementation relies on the calculation of `cosh(2b)`, which would be incorrect if the placeholder is replaced with `2 * a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the arcus cotangent implementation relies on the calculation of `cosh(2b)`, which would be incorrect if the placeholder is replaced with `2 - b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the arcus cotangent implementation relies on the calculation of `cosh(2b)`, which would be incorrect if the placeholder is replaced with `2 / b`.

DONE.
