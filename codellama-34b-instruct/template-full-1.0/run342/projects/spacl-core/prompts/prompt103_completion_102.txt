  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb, ctx, path
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could affect the way the function is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + path, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of `verb` and `path` would create a different value, which could affect the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0], ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the `path` value, which could affect the way the `query` method is executed.

DONE.
