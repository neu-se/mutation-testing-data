  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in this.verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of `this.verbs`, rather than the `verb` variable, which would cause the `allow` and `deny` methods to have no effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in this.verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the properties of `this.verbs`, but it would not apply the same checks as the original code, such as checking if the property is a function or if it is in `this.verbs`.
