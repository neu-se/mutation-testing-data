  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was `output`, because it calls the `end()` method on the `output` stream, which is not necessary in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('')
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was `output`, because it calls the `write()` method on the `output` stream with an empty string as the argument, which is not necessary in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was `output`, because it pipes the `output` stream to `process.stdout`, which is not necessary in the original code.

DONE.
