  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but `read + 1` is a number, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but `read - 1` is a number, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but `read * 2` is a number, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
