  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(resolvedPromise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `resolvedPromise` object, which is not the same as the `promise` object that is the target of the `promiseDispatch` method. This would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.
