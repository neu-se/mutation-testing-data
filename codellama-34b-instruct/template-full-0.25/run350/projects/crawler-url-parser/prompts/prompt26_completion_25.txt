  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire URL with a space instead of removing the fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire URL with "https://" instead of removing the fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the entire URL with "http://" instead of removing the fragment.

DONE.
