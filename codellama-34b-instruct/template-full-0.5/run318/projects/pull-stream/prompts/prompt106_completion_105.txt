  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function that is called when the drain operation is complete, whereas `done()` calls the function immediately and passes no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will not be called when the drain operation is complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will not be called when the drain operation is complete.

DONE.
