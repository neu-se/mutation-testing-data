  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is already rejected with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object that can be resolved or rejected later, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is pending.

DONE.
