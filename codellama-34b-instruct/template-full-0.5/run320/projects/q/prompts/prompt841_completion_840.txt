  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. In this case, `null` would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `void 0`, which is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. In this case, `undefined` would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not the
