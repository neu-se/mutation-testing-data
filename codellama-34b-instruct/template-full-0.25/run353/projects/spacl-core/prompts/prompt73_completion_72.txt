  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.clone()` would create a new instance of the `QueryContext` object, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` would return the path of the `QueryContext` object, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.verb` would return the verb of the `QueryContext` object, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query` method.

DONE.
