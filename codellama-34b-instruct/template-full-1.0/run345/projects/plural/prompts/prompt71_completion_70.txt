  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because additional 's' would be added at the end of word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be calculated and returned instead of the plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because empty string would be concatenated at the end of the word, resulting in the same word.

DONE.
