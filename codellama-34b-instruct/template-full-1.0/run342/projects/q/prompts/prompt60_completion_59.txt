  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a different function with a different purpose than `setImmediate`. `setTimeout` is used to delay the execution of a function by a specified number of milliseconds, while `setImmediate` is used to schedule the execution of a function as soon as possible, but still asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is a different function with a different purpose than `setImmediate`. `requestAnimationFrame` is used to schedule the execution of a function before the next repaint of the screen, while `setImmediate` is used to schedule the execution of a function as soon as possible, but still asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all([setTimeout(()=>{}, 0)])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` is a
