  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is always truthy, so the loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cbed` is always falsy, so the loop would never iterate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is always truthy, so the loop would never terminate.

DONE.
