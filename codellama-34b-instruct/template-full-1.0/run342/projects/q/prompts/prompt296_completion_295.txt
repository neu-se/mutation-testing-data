  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a promise as its argument, but `y` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not available on the `Promise` prototype, so this code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).race
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` function expects an array of promises as its argument, but `x` is not an array.

DONE.
