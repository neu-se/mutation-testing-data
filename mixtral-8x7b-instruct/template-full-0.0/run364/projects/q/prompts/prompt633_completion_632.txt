 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"splice", [key, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input object by removing the property at the specified index instead of deleting the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"set", [key, undefined]
