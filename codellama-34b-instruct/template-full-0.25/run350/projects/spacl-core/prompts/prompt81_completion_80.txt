  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts the `path` string to lowercase, which may not be the desired behavior for the `matches()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method splits the `path` string into an array of substrings, and the `[0]` index accesses the first element of the array. This may not be the desired behavior for the `matches()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the `/` character in the `path` string with an empty string, which may not be the desired behavior for the `matches()` method.

DONE.
