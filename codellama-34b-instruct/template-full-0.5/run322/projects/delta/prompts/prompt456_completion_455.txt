  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.index` to determine the last index of the `ops` array, while the replaced code uses `this.ops.length - 1` which would give the last index of the `ops` array minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.index` to determine the last index of the `ops` array, while the replaced code uses `this.ops.length` which would give the length of the `ops` array, and not the last index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.index` to determine the last index of the `ops` array, while the replaced code uses `this.ops.length - this.index
