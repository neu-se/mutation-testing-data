  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest.split('/').pop()` would return the last segment of the URL path, whereas `options.dest` would return the entire URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest.replace(/\//g, '')` would remove all forward slashes from the URL path, whereas `options.dest` would leave them intact.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').slice(-1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest.split('/').slice(-1)[0]` would return the last segment of the URL path, whereas `options.dest` would return the entire URL path.

DONE.
