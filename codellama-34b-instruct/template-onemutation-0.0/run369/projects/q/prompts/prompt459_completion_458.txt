  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0, -1), promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove the promise from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to a memory leak.
