  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it has a different behavior when it comes to handling `this` and arguments. In this specific case, `call` would not work as expected because it would not pass the correct `this` context to the `apply` method.

DONE.
