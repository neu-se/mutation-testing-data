  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of keys in the object, rather than the keys themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the keys in sorted order, rather than the original order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the keys in reverse order, rather than the original order.

DONE.
