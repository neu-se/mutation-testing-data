This could cause the function to throw an error or return an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", () => { throw new Error("Test error") }
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `definition` function would be a function that throws an error, instead of the
