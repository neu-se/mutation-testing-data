 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the constructor used for the `fcall()` method in the `finally` method implementation. This could cause issues if the `Promise` constructor behaves differently than the `Q` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the error handling in the `finally` method implementation. If the `callback.fcall()` method throws an error, it would not be caught and handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `fcall()` method in the `finally` method implementation. Instead of returning a promise, it would return the `callback` function itself, which could cause issues if the rest of the code expects a promise.

DONE.
