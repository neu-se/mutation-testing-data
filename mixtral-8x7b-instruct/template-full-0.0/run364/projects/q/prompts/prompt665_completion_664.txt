 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method expects an array-like object, and an empty array is a valid one. However, the resulting array would be empty, which would cause the `invoke` method to fail since it expects at least one argument (the method name) after the target object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` expects an array-like object, and `null` is not a valid array-like object. This would cause the `invoke` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `slice` on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
