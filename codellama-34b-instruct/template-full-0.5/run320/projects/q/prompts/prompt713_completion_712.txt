  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` and `values` are different methods in the `Q` object, and `values` is not a valid method for the `Q.keys` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `["foo"]` is not an empty array, and the `Q.keys` function would return a promise that is fulfilled with the keys of the object, but not the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[1]` is not an empty array, and the `Q.keys` function would return a promise that is fulfilled with the keys of the object, but not the values.

DONE.
