 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` using `let` instead of `var`, making it block-scoped instead of function-scoped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `i` to 1 instead of 0, causing the loop to skip the first rule in the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other rule in the `rules` array.

DONE.
