 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `policy.query(path, verb, null)` instead of using the provided `ctx` object, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the `policy.query` method relies on the `ctx` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<any>
```
This would result in different behavior because the type of the third argument of the `policy.query` method would always be `any`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the `policy.query` method relies on a specific type for the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always pass an empty object as the third argument instead of the provided `ctx` object, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the `policy.query` method relies on the `ctx` object.
