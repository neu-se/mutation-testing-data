  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the wrong position in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the wrong position in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the end of the `ops` array, rather than at the correct position.

DONE.
