  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first capture group of the regex match, which is the file name, instead of the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third capture group of the regex match, which is not defined in the regex pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fourth capture group of the regex match, which is not defined in the regex pattern.

DONE.
