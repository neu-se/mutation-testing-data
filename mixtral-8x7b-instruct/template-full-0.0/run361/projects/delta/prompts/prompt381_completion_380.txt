 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next().insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `insert` property of the result of `otherIter.next()`, which might not have an `insert` property if the next operation is a delete or retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.skip(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the next operation instead of returning it, potentially causing the loop to behave differently or even terminate prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peek()
