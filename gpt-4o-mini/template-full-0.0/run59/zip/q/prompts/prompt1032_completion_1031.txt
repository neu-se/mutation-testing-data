Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the resolved value instead of the error to the nodeback, which would lead to the callback being invoked with a success value instead of an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always calls the nodeback with `null` for both the error and value, which would mislead the caller into thinking the operation was successful regardless of the actual outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the error as the first argument but provides `undefined` as the second argument, which is not the expected value and could cause confusion for the caller expecting a valid result.

DONE.
