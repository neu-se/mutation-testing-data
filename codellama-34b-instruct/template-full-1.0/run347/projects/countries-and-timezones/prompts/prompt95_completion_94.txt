  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `country` variable, while this new fragment checks for the value of `country` to be null. This change could potentially cause the tests to pass even if the `country` variable is not defined, leading to a false sense of security.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.someProperty === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `country` variable, while this new fragment checks for the existence of the `someProperty` property on the `country` object. This change could potentially cause the tests to pass even if the `country` object does not have the expected properties, leading to a false sense of security.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of the `country` variable, while this new fragment checks the
