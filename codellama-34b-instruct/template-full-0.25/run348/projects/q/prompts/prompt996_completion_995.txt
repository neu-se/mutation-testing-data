  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would change the `this` context of the `makeNodeResolver` function, potentially causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would change the `this` context of the `makeNodeResolver` function, potentially causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the `this` context of the `makeNodeResolver` function, potentially causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
