  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substr method is called with a different length parameter, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substr method is called with a different starting point, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w[0] + '
