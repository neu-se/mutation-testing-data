  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. In this case, `object.hasOwnProperty` will be called on `object`, which is different from the original behavior of `object.hasOwnProperty` being called on the global object (or `undefined`, in strict mode).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` method allows specifying the value of `this` and executing the function with those arguments, exactly like `bind()`, but immediately invoking the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.apply(object, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply()`
