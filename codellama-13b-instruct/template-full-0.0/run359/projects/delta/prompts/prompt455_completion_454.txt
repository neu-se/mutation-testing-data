  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the next index after the current index, rather than the current index. This could cause the `rest` method to return a different set of operations than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the previous index before the current index, rather than the current index. This could cause the `rest` method to return a different set of operations than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array starting from the index two positions after the current index, rather than the current index.
