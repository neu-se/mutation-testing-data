  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the non-deprecated timezones, whereas the original code would return all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code would return all timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, whereas the original code would return only the non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
