  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used for strict inequality, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the two values are not strictly equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used for less than, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the two values are not less than each other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used for greater than, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the two values are not greater than each other.

DONE.
