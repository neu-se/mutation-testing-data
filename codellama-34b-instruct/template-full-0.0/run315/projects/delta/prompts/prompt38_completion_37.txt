  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the property `key` in object `b` to the value of the property `key` in object `a`, rather than comparing the values of the two objects directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the property `key` in object `a` to the value of the property `key` in object `b`, rather than comparing the values of the two objects directly.

DONE.
