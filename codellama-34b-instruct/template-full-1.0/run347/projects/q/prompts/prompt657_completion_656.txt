```
'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a string and not a reference to an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a number and not a reference to an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a null and not a reference to an array of arguments.

Done.
