  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.readFile` is a different function than `fs.promises.access`, and it would cause the code to read the contents of the file instead of checking its permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.writeFile` is a different function than `fs.promises.access`, and it would cause the code to write to the file instead of checking its permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.unlink
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.unlink` is a different function than `fs.promises.access`, and it would cause the code to delete the file instead of checking its permissions.

DONE.
