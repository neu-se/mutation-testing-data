Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would indicate a successful completion of the operation, passing `null` as the error, instead of propagating the abort signal, which could lead to incorrect handling of the abort scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Aborted'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with a message indicating that the operation was aborted, rather than simply passing the abort signal, which could mislead the caller about the nature of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the abort signal as the first argument and `null` as the second, which is not the expected signature for the callback, potentially causing confusion or errors in the handling of the callback response.

DONE.
