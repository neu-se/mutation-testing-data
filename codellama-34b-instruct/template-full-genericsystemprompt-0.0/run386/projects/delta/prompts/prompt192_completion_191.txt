  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations in the other iterator, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the delta has no operations, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue for at most 10 iterations, regardless of the contents of the iterators.

DONE.
