  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into individual characters, rather than into substrings based on the "/" separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into substrings based on the "/" separator, but would also include the "/" character in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(/[^\/]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path into substrings based on the "/" separator, but would also include the "/" character in the resulting array, and would also include any other characters that are not "/".

DONE.
