  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start one character later than the original code, potentially returning a different slice of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start one character earlier than the original code, potentially returning a different slice of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at a different position than the original code, potentially returning a different slice of the base delta.

DONE.
