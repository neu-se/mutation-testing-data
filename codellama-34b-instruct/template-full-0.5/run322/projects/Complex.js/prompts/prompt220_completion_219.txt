  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` are inverses of each other, so the resulting complex number would have a different magnitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` are related functions, but they are not inverses of each other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` and `Math.sin` are inverses of each other, but `Math.asin` returns a value in the range of -π/2 to π/2, while `Math.sin` returns a value in the range of -1 to 1.

DONE.
