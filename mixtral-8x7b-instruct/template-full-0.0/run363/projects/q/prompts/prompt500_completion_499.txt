 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` in the applied function, unlike the original `apply` method which uses the provided `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call(thisp, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the function with a comma-separated list of arguments, while the original `apply` method accepts an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.prototype.apply.call(value, thisp, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls the `apply` method from the constructor's prototype, which might not have the desired effect if the value is not a function or if the constructor has been modified.

DONE.
