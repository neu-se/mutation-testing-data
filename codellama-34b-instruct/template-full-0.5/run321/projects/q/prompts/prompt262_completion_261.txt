  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(fulfill(value)));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a function, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
