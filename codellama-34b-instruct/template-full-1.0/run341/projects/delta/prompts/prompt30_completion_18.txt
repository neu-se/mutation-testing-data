  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] == attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator has been changed from `!==` to `==`, which would cause the logic to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] >= attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator has been changed from `!==` to `>=`, which would cause the logic to be different for certain values of `base[key]` and `attr[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second part of the expression has been removed, which would cause the logic to be different for certain values of `attr[key]`.

DONE.
