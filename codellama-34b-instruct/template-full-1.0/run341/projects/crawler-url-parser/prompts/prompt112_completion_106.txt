  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` declaration would be ignored, and the `currentUrl` variable would not exist in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = {url: null, baseurl: null, protocol: null,
	host: null, domain: null, subdomain: null, path: null, search: null,
	querycount: 0};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object would be initialized with default values instead of being `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = new URL(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object would be initialized with the `baseUrlStr` instead of being `undefined`.

DONE.
