  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'typ'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a typo in the key `type` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'tyep'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is another typo in the key `type` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a missing colon in the key `type` in the original code.

DONE.
