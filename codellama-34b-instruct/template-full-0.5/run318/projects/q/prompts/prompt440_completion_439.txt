  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the reason for the rejection instead of the promise, which could lead to different handling of the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the promise that was reported as unhandled instead of the rejection, which could lead to different handling of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the number of unhandled rejections instead of the rejection itself, which could lead to different handling of the rejection.

DONE.
