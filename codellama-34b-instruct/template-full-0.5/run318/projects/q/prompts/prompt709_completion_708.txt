  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with a different length and content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with a different length and content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with a different length and content.

DONE.
