  Sure, here are some possible options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this` refers to the `GeoPoint` object, and `point` refers to the `GeoPoint` argument passed to the `calculateBearing` method. By replacing `this` and `point` with `this.latitude` and `this.longitude`, the method is now using the latitude and longitude values of the `GeoPoint` object as the coordinates for calculating the bearing, rather than using the coordinates of the `GeoPoint` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `point` is a `GeoPoint` argument passed to the `calculateBearing` method. By replacing `this` and `point` with `point.latitude` and `point.longitude`, the method is now using the
