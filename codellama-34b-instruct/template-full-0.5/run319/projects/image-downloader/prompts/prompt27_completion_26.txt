  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `options.url` is a string. The `request` function would receive a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, but `options.dest.toString()` is a function that returns a string. The `request` function would receive a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, but `options.dest.split('.')[0]` is a string that is the first part of the original string, separated by a period. The `request` function would receive a different argument, which could
