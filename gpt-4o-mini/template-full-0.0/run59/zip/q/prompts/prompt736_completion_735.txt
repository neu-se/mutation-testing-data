Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the array of promises directly instead of the current promise instance, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `all` function to treat it as an empty array, which would immediately resolve to an empty array instead of processing the current promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would also lead to the `all` function treating it as an empty array, similar to passing `null`, thus bypassing any promises that were supposed to be processed.

DONE.
