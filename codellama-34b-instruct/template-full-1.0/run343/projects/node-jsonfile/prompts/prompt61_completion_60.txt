  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the variable `content` is a buffer, while the replacement code fragment `Buffer.isBuffer === true` checks if the variable `content` is strictly equal to the boolean `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the variable `content` is a buffer, while the replacement code fragment `Buffer.isBuffer !== true` checks if the variable `content` is not strictly equal to the boolean `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the variable `content` is a buffer, while the replacement code fragment `!Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the variable `content` is not a
