  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter, which would return a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly access the `timezones` object with the `name` key, which would return the timezone object stored under that key, rather than calling the `getTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] || getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first try to access the `timezones` object with the `name` key, and if that returns `null` or `undefined`, it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` parameter.

DONE.
