  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end === true) {
    done(null);
  } else {
    done(end);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `done` callback with the `end` value, while this new code fragment would call it with `null` if `end` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end === true) {
    done(null);
  } else {
    done(end);
