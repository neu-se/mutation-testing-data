  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with the `stackLine` argument, which would return an array containing the file name and line number of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with the `stackLine` and `1` arguments, which would return an array containing the file name and line number of the stack trace, and the line number would be incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with the `stackLine` and `2` arguments, which would return an array containing the file name and line number of the
