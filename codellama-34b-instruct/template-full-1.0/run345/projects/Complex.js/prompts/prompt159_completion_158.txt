  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the denominator is zero and only then returns Complex['NAN'], while this replacement will always return Complex['NAN'].

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the denominator is zero and returns Complex['ZERO'] in that case, while this replacement will always return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the denominator is non-zero and returns the result of the division in that case, while this replacement will always return 1.

DONE.
