  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `priority`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to the opposite of what it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority = !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of `priority` and assigns the result back to `priority`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to the opposite of what it would with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `priority` to `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` regardless of the original value of `priority`.

DONE.
