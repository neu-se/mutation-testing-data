 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects an array as the second argument, and `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'not an array'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects an array as the second argument, and a string would not be processed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{then: function() {}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function expects an array as the second argument, and a plain object with a `then` method would be treated as a promise, but it would not have the expected elements.

DONE.
