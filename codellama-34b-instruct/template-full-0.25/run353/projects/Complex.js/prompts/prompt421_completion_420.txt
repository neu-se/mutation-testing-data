  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while `isZero` checks if the real and imaginary parts are both zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, while `isZero` checks if the real and imaginary parts are both zero.

DONE.
