  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a different function from `post`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"push", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a different function from `post`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pop", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a different function from `post`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
