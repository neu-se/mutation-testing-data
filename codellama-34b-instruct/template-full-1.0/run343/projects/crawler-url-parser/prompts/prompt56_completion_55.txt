  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second parameter, `true`, would cause the URL to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the third parameter, `false`, would prevent the URL from being normalized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second and third parameters would cause the URL to be resolved and normalized, respectively.

DONE.
