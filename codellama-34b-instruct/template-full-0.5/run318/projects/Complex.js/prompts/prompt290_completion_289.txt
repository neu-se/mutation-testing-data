  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. In the original code, `b` is used as is, without any negation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is increased by 1. In the original code, `b` is used as is, without any addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is multiplied by 2. In the original code, `b` is used as is, without any multiplication.

DONE.
