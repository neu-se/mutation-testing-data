Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.write` is used to send a chunk of the response body, whereas `this.writeHead` is used to send the HTTP headers, so replacing `this.writeHead` with `this.write` would cause the headers to be sent as part of the response body instead of as headers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.writeHead(this.statusCode + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.statusCode + 1` would send a different HTTP status code than the original code, potentially changing the behavior of the client or other parts of the system that rely on the status code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.writeHead
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.writeHead` is equivalent to `this.writeHead` in this context, but using `res` instead of `this` could potentially cause issues if the context of `this` changes, and some linters or code analysis tools might flag this as a potential issue.

DONE.
