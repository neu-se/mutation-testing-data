  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '.' operator will not match '\' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'  '
```
This would result in different behavior because the ' ' operator will not match any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5 ? ' ' : '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the Math.random() function will generate different results on each execution.

DONE.
