  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current operation and move to the next one, potentially missing a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move to the previous operation instead of the current one, potentially causing the algorithm to miss a necessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move to a different operation than the current one, potentially causing the algorithm to miss a necessary operation or perform an unnecessary operation.

DONE.
