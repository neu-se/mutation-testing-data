 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `abortCb` function from being called if the async operation is aborted after the `map` function has started processing the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` value, instead of waiting for the `map` function to complete. This could potentially cause issues if the `abortCb` function expects to be called with a different argument or if it needs to perform some cleanup before returning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `abortCb` function with an empty function, which would prevent it from performing any necessary cleanup or error handling when the async operation is aborted.

DONE.
