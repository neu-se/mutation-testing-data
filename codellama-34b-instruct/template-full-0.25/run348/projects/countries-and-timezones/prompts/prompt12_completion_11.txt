  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new object for the `result[country]` property, even if one already existed. This would cause the `result` object to have multiple copies of the same country object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: tz.r, all: tz.r };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `current` and `all` properties of the `result[country]` object to the same value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: tz.r, all: tz.r.concat(tz.a) };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `current` property of the `result[country]` object to the same value
