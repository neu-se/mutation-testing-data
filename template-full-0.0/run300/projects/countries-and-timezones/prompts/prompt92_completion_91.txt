  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` variable is used to retrieve a country object from the `countries` object, and adding 1 to it would cause the function to retrieve a different country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` variable is used to retrieve a country object from the `countries` object, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the function to retrieve a different country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` variable is used to retrieve a country object from the `countries` object, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the function to retrieve a different country object.

DONE.
