 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to `Q.nbind.apply()`, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this, args
