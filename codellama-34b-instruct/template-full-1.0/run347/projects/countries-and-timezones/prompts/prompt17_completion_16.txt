  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.a
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.a` is a different property than `id`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.c[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.c[0]` is the first element of the `tz.c` array, while `id` is a string representing the country ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries` is a list of countries, while `id` is a string representing the country ID.

DONE.
