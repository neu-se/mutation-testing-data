  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is not called, and the `spawn` function would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with the wrong `this` context, and the `spawn` function would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with the wrong `this` context and the wrong arguments, and the `spawn` function would not work as intended.

DONE.
