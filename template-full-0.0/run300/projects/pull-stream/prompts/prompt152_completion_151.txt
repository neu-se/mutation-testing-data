  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value passed as the first argument to `abortCb` would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(undefined, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value passed as the first argument to `abortCb` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(false, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the first argument to `abortCb` would cause the function to return `false` instead of the expected `cb` function.

DONE.
