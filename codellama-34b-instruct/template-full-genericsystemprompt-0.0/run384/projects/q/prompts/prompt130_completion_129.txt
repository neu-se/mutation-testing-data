  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the loop to skip every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the loop to visit every other element in the array twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the loop to visit every element in the array except for the first one.

DONE.
