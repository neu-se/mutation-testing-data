  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseLike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseLike` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a different function than `isPromiseAlike`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the code.

DONE.
