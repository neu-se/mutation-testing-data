 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator of the returned complex number would become 0 when `b` is 0, causing a division-by-zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sign of the second component of the returned complex number when `b` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the magnitude of the second component of the returned complex number, making it much larger than the original value.

DONE.
