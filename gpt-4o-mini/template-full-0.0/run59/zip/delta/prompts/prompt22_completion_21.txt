Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider `null` as a different value than `undefined`, potentially leading to attributes being included in the result that should be excluded when comparing two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include attributes where the values are strictly equal, which could miss cases where the values are equivalent but not strictly equal (e.g., different types).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality, which could lead to unexpected matches (e.g., `0` and `false` would be considered equal), potentially including attributes that should not be included in the diff.

DONE.
