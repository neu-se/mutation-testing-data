  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a different set of arguments, which could lead to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a different set of arguments, which could lead to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a different set of arguments, which could lead to a different output.

DONE.
