  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first operation from the `other` delta, rather than the first operation from the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the second operation from the `other` delta, rather than the first operation from the `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[2]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the third operation from the `other` delta, rather than the first operation from the `this` delta.

DONE.
