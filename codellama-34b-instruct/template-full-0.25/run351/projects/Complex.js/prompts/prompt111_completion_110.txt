  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and the negation of that check would return `true` for any value that is not NaN, including finite numbers and infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is finite, and it would return `true` for any finite number, including integers and floating-point numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and it would return `true` for any value that is not a number, including `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`.

DONE.
