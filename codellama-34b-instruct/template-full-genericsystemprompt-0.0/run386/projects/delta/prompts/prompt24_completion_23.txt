  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` instead of `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `b[key] + 1` instead of `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the sum of `a[key]` and `b[key]` instead of `b[key]`.

DONE.
