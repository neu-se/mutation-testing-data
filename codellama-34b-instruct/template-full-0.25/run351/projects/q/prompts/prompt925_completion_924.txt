  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the current scope, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the existing `deferred` object that is being used in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that creates a new node resolver object, which is not the same as the existing `deferred` object that is being used in the code.

DONE.
