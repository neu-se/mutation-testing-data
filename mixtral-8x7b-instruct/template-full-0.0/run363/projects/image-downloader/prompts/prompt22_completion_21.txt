 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` returns a path with platform-specific separators, while `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./' + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle relative paths correctly, and would not resolve the path to an absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('path').resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the `path` module to be imported again, and would not use the already imported `path` module.

DONE.
