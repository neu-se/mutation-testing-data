  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is removed, causing the regex to match only lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex is added, causing the regex to match all occurrences in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is added, causing the regex to match only uppercase letters.

DONE.
