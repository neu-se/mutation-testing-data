  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` value, which would cause the `resolver` function to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `resolver` function with the `this` value set to `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error if it relies on the `this` value being a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `resolver` function with the `this` value set to `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error if it relies on the `this` value being a promise.

DONE.
