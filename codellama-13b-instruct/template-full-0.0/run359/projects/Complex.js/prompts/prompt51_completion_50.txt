  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.isFinite` is a different function than `Number.isFinite`. `Math.isFinite` checks if a number is finite, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['r'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite(a['r'])` checks if the value of `a['r']` is a finite number, while `Number.isFinite` checks if the value of `a['r']` is a finite number and a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['r'] !== undefined` checks if the value of `a['r']` is not undefined, while `Number.isFinite` checks if the value
