  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the base is zero, while the new code fragment checks if the base is zero and the exponent is real.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the base is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the base is infinite and the exponent is real.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the base is NaN, while the new code fragment checks if the base is NaN and the exponent is real.

DONE.
