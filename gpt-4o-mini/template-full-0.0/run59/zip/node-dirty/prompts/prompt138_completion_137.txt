Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'nonexistentKey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to retrieve the value associated with a key that does not exist in `_data`, leading to `undefined` being written instead of the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the size of the `_data` map instead of the value associated with the specific key, which is not the intended functionality of the `_flush` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the key by appending '1', which would cause the code to look for a different key in `_data`, potentially leading to incorrect data being written or an error if that key does not exist.

DONE.
