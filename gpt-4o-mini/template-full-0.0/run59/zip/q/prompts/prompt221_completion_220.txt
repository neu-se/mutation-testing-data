Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates an object with no prototype, which means it won't inherit any properties or methods from `Promise.prototype`, potentially leading to runtime errors when trying to access methods that are expected to be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Array.prototype` instead of `Promise.prototype` would make the `promise` object inherit from the Array prototype, which is not appropriate for a promise and could lead to unexpected behavior when calling promise-specific methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `deferred` to `null` would mean that `deferred.promise` and `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.fulfill`, and `deferred.reject` would be undefined, leading to errors when these methods are called, as they would not exist on a null value.

DONE.
