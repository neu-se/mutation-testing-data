  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is used to determine the type of an embedded object, and adding 1 to it would cause the code to interpret the object as a different type, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
