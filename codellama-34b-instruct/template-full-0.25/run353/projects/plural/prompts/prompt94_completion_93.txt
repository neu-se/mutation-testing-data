  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the replacement function is also different. The original code fragment uses a case-insensitive match for "man" or "woman", while the new code fragment uses a case-insensitive match for "woman" only. Additionally, the replacement function in the new code fragment replaces the letter "a" with "e", while the original code fragment does not perform any replacement.
