  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would return `null` instead of a string representation of the object, leading to incorrect or missing data being written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would return `undefined` instead of a string representation of the object, leading to incorrect or missing data being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{obj: obj}
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` would return a string representation of the object wrapped in an object with a single property named `obj`, leading to incorrect or missing data being written to the file.

DONE.
