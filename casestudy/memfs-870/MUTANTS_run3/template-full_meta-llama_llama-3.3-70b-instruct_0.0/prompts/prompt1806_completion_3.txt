Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially causing issues if the file does not exist or if the intention is to read from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the intention is to read or write to the file from the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + '.tmp', 'r'
```
This would result in different behavior because a different file would be opened, potentially causing issues if the file does not exist or if the intention is to read from the original file.

DONE.
