  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the singular form of the word, regardless of the number passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the number passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + (num === 1 ? '' : 's')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the singular form of the word if the number passed to the function is 1, and the plural form otherwise.

DONE.
