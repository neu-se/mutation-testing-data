  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be returned instead of the `fulfilled` value, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be returned instead of the `fulfilled` value, which would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
