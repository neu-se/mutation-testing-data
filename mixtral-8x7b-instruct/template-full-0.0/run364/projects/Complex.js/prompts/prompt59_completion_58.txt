 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof a['r'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `a['r']` as a string instead of using the `Number.isFinite` function to check if the value is a finite number. This might pass some inputs that should have failed, causing the test suite to miss detecting potential issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a['r'] !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a['r']` is not equal to `Infinity` instead of checking if it's a finite number. This might pass some inputs that should have failed, causing the test suite to miss detecting potential issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNaN(a['r'])
