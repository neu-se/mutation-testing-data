Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `null`, leading to a runtime error instead of correctly dispatching the operation on the intended object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `undefined`, which would similarly lead to a runtime error, preventing the intended operation from being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalidObject"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of an object to the `dispatch` method, which would likely result in an error when trying to access properties or methods on a string that are expected to be present on an object.

DONE.
