  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `-cosh` is the negative of `cosh`, which would cause the complex sinh and cosh functions to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `2cosh` is twice the value of `cosh`, which would cause the complex sinh and cosh functions to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh + cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh + cosh` is the sum of `sinh` and `cosh`, which would cause the complex sinh and cosh functions to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
