  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the values of a and b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1, regardless of the values of a and b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of a and b, regardless of the value of the expression (a + b) / (a - b).

DONE.
