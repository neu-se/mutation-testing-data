  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` object has a property called `url` that contains the URL string, whereas the original code fragment `baseUrlStr` is a variable that contains the URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` object has a property called `protocol` that contains the protocol string, whereas the original code fragment `baseUrlStr` is a variable that contains the URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` object has a property called `host` that contains the host string, whereas the original code fragment `baseUrlStr` is a variable that contains the URL string.

DONE.
