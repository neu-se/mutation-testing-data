  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'close'` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is no longer busy and is ready to accept more data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs during the write operation, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is no longer busy and is ready to accept more data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'finish'` event is emitted when the write stream has completed writing all the data to the underlying system, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is no longer busy and is ready to accept more data.

DONE.
