  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `logHypot` are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a + b, a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `logHypot` are different, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a, b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `logHypot` is being called with the same arguments, but the result is being incremented by 1, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
