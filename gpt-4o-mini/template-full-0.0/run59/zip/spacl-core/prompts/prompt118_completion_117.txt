Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the verb is explicitly allowed, ignoring the case where the verb is not governed by the rule, which could lead to incorrect permissions being granted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if the path does not match the rule, regardless of the verb's status, effectively denying all actions on paths that do not match, even if they are allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) || verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the verb is present in the verbs object, regardless of whether the path matches the rule, potentially allowing actions that should be denied based on the path.

DONE.
