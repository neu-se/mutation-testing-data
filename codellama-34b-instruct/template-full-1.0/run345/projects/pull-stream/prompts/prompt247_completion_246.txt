  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with the `err` argument, even if there is no error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with no arguments, even if there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb(err) || cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with no arguments if there is no error, but if there is an error, it would call the callback with the `err` argument.

DONE.
