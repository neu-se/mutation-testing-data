  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `nodeback`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `1` to the value of `nodeback`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `nodeback` is a function that returns a value that is not greater than `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would call the function `nodeback` if it is a function, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if `nodeback` is a function that does not return a truthy value.

DONE.
