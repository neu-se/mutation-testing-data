  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value of `index` was less than the length of the array, and if it was, it would break out of the loop. If we replace the PLACEHOLDER with `2`, the loop will never break, and it will continue to iterate over the entire array, even if the length of the array is greater than the value of `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value of `index` was less than the length of the array, and if it was, it would break out of the loop. If we replace the PLACEHOLDER with `3`, the loop will break out of the loop earlier than it would with the original code fragment, because the value of `index` will be greater than the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
