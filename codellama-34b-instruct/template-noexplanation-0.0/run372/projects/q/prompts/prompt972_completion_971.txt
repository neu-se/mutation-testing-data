  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method, which will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(args)
```
This code fragment will cause the `nmapply` method to pass too many arguments to the `post` method, which will also result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== name; })
```
This code fragment will cause the `nmapply` method to pass the wrong arguments to the `post` method, which will also result in an error.

DONE.
