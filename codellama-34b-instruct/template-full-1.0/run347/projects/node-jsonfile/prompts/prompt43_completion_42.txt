  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
something-else
```
This would result in different behavior because `something-else` is not defined and would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `obj` array, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `obj` by one, while the original code would not.

DONE.
