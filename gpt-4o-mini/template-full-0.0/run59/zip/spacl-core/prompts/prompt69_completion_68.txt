Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from `query` to `matches`, which may not return the same boolean values and could lead to incorrect access control decisions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule.query
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `query` method, meaning that if the original method returned `true`, it would now return `false`, and vice versa, leading to incorrect access control outcomes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the result to always be `false`, regardless of the actual outcome of the `query` method, effectively denying all actions governed by the policy.

DONE.
