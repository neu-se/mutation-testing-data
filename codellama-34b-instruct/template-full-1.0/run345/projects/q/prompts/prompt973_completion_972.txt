  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.noConflict()
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.noConflict() is a function that returns a new instance of Q, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null, 42)
```
This would result in different behavior because Q(null, 42) is a different value from Q, and it would change the behavior of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q is null")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, terminating the program.

DONE.
