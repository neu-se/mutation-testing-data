  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `opLength` variable to determine the length of the current operation, while the modified code fragment is using `opLength + 1`, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the operation length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `opLength` variable to determine the length of the current operation, while the modified code fragment is using `opLength - 1`, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the operation length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `opLength` variable to determine the length of the current operation, while the modified code fragment is using `opLength * 2`, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the operation length.

DONE.
