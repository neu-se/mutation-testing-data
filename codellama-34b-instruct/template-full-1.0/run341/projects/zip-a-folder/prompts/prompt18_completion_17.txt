  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
``
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the permission check to only check for read access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the permission check to only check for execute access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the permission check to only check for file existence, rather than read and write access.

DONE.
