 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function, which might have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first property name from the arguments object, which is not equivalent to slicing the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments object with `null`, which would cause an error in the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line, since `null` does not have a `push` method.

DONE.
