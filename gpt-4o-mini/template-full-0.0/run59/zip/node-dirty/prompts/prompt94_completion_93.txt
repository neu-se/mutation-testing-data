Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval(rowStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` executes the string as JavaScript code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected results if the input is not controlled, unlike `JSON.parse` which safely parses a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Function('return ' + rowStr)()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `new Function` creates a new function that executes the string as code, which can also introduce security risks and may not handle malformed JSON correctly, unlike `JSON.parse` which expects valid JSON format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(':')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because this code simply splits the string at the first colon and takes the second part, which does not parse the string as JSON at all and will likely lead to incorrect or undefined behavior when trying to access properties like `key` in the expected object structure.

DONE.
