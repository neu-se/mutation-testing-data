  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations in the other iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the other iterator has no more operations, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the other iterator has no more operations, which could lead to an infinite loop.

DONE.
