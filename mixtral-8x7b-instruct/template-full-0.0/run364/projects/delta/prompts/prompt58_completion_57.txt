 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.includes(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the newOp already exists in the ops array using the 'includes' method, which returns a boolean instead of unconditionally inserting the newOp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length > index
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the index is within the bounds of the ops array, but it doesn't account for cases where the index is equal to the length of the array, which would incorrectly prevent the newOp from being inserted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op === newOp).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the newOp already exists in the ops array by filtering the array and checking the length of the resulting filtered array, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results if the new
