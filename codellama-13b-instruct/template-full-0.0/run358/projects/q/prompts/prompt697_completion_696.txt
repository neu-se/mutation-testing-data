  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not an array, and the `array_slice` function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, and the `all` function would resolve immediately with an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the values `1`, `2`, and `3`, and the `all` function would resolve with an array containing the values `1`, `2`, and `3`.

DONE.
