  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a code fragment that has different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite(this.isInfinite())
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite, while `this.isInfinite()` is a method call that returns a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite(this['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is infinite, while `this['isInfinite']()` is a method call that returns a boolean value.

DONE.
