  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the replaced code fragment `cb(null, _value)` is a function call with an additional argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the replaced code fragment `cb(null, value)` is a function call with two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the replaced code fragment `cb(true, _value)` is a function call with two arguments, and the first argument is a boolean value instead of the original null value.

DONE.
