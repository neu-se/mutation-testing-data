  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with length 1, while the original code would return a string with length 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with length 1, while the original code would return a string with length 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string with length 1, while the original code would return a string with length 0.

DONE.
