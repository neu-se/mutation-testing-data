  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not matching the same pattern as the original code.

DONE.
