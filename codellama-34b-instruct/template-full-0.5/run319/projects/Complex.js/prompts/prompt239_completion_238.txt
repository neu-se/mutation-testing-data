  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` computes the cube root of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the larger of two numbers, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root.

DONE.
