  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for read and write permissions instead of just read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for read and execute permissions instead of just read permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.F_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for read and existence permissions instead of just read permissions.

DONE.
