  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would no longer be called, and the `asyncMap` function would return a function that always returns the input value without any mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = function (data, cb) { cb(null, data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would always return the input value without any mapping, and the `asyncMap` function would return a function that always returns the input value without any mapping.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map = function (data, cb) { cb(new Error('test error')) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would always return an error, and the `asyncMap` function would return a function that always returns an error.

DONE.
