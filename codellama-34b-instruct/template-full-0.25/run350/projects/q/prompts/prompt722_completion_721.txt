  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to resolve with an array of rejected promises, rather than an array of fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to never resolve, since the promise is always pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled" && promise.inspect().value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `all` function to resolve with an array of promises that are fulfilled with `undefined`, rather than an array of promises that are fulfilled with the expected values.

DONE.
