  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because pop() removes the last element of the array, whereas push() adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because shift() removes the first element of the array, whereas push() adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because unhandledReasons is a different array from unhandledRejections, and this would add the reason to a different array.

DONE.
