  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` callback would be called with `true` instead of `null` when the stream is ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` callback would be called with `false` instead of `null` when the stream is ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` callback would be called with `undefined` instead of `null` when the stream is ended.

DONE.
