  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
in.nodes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `stackLine` property is an element of the array `in`, rather than searching for a substring within the `stackLine` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~stackLine.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the index of the first occurrence of `stackLine` within the entire `in` array is negative, rather than checking if the index of the first occurrence is greater than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
>>>stackLine.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first occurrence of `stackLine` within the entire `in` array is a string, rather than checking if the index of the first occurrence is greater than or equal to 0.

DONE.
