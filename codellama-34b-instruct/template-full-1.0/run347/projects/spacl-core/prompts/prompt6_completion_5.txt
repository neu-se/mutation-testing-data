  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches any character except for a forward slash, instead of matching the start of a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:^|\\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches either the start of the input or a forward slash, instead of just the start of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[/]/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches any character except for a forward slash at the start of the input, instead of just matching the start of the input.

DONE.
