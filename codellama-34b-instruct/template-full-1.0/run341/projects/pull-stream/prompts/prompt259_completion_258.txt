  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function and calling it would execute the code inside the function, while the original code was only referencing the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents the absence of an object, while the original code was expecting a function or a stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number that would be interpreted as a truthy value, while the original code was expecting a function or a stream that could be called with `cb`.

DONE.
