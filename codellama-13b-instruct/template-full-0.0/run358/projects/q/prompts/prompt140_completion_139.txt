  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would be replaced with `===`, which is a strict equality operator that would only return true if the two operands are strictly equal, including the type. In the original code, `||` is a logical OR operator that would return the first truthy value or the last value if all values are falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would be replaced with `!`, which is a logical NOT operator that would return the opposite boolean value of the operand. In the original code, `||` is a logical OR operator that would return the first truthy value or the last value if all values are falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would be replaced with `.length`, which is a property that returns the length of
