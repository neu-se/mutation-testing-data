  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip every other promise in the array, potentially leading to missed rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to check the same promise multiple times, potentially leading to duplicate rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip over every other promise in the array, potentially leading to missed rejections.

DONE.
