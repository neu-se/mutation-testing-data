  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stream` variable is expected to be a truthy value, but `null` is falsy. This would cause the `nextStream` function to be called instead of the `nextChunk` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stream` variable is expected to be a truthy value, but `undefined` is falsy. This would cause the `nextStream` function to be called instead of the `nextChunk` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stream` variable is expected to be a truthy value, but `0` is falsy. This would cause the `nextStream` function to be called instead of the `nextChunk` function, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
