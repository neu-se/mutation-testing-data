Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `defer` variable to `null`, which would cause any subsequent calls to `defer.promise` or `defer.resolve` to throw an error, breaking the promise functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `defer` as an empty object, which would not have the expected `promise`, `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` methods, leading to runtime errors when these methods are called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = { promise: "not a promise" };
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a string to `defer.promise` instead of a promise object, which would cause any operations expecting a promise to fail, as they would not be able to call promise methods like `then` or `catch`.

DONE.
