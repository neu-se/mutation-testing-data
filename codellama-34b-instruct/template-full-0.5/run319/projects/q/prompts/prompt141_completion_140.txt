  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source` is a function that returns the next promise in the chain, while `p.source.next` is a property that references the next promise in the chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source` is a function that returns the next promise in the chain, while `p.source + 1` is a number that represents the next promise in the chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.then(function () { return p.source.next; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source.then` is a function that returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, while `p.source.next` is a property that references the next promise in the chain.

DONE.
