 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the counter `i` would not increment, and the function would return the same value for every call, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a random value instead of incrementing the counter `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max ? i : max
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value of `i` when it is less than `max`, and `max` when it is greater than or equal to `max`, instead of incrementing the counter `i` and returning a boolean value when `i` is greater than `max`.

DONE.
