  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is not correct. The `read_error` event is emitted when an error occurs while reading the file, but the `read_close` event is emitted when the file is closed after being read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is not correct. The `write_error` event is emitted when an error occurs while writing to the file, but the `read_close` event is emitted when the file is closed after being read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is not specific to reading or writing. The `error` event is emitted when any error occurs, regardless of whether it occurs while reading or writing.

DONE.
