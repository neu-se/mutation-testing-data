  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "xyz"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ "xyz"` would cause the `url` property to be concatenated with the string "xyz", effectively changing the value of the `url` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring(1)` method would return the substring of the `url` property starting from the second character, effectively changing the value of the `url` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split("/")` method would split the `url` property into an array of strings using "/" as the separator, and then the `[0]` index would access the first element of the array, effectively changing the value of the `url` property.

DONE.
