  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, while `verbs` returns the object itself. This change would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, while `verbs` returns the object itself. This change would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.entries()` returns an array of the key-value pairs in the `verbs` object, while `ver
