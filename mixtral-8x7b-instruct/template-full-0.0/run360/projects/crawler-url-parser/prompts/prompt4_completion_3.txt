 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr !== null && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the loose equality `==` to strict equality `===`, which may cause the condition to fail if `currentUrlStr` is an object that is truthy but not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr.toString())
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `current
