  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument `arg` would be incremented by 1 in the new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument `arg` would be multiplied by 2 in the new code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument `arg` would be subtracted by 10 in the new code fragment.

DONE.
