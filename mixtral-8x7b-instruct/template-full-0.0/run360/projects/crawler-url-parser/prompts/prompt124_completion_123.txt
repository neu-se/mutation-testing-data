 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator, not an array. The `Array.from()` method would not be able to convert it, and the `map()` function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a iterator of keys, not an array of values. The `Array.from()` method would not be able to convert it, and the `map()` function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `urlMap.values()` iterator. The `map()` function would work correctly, but any further modification to the original `urlMap` would not be reflected in the copied array.

DONE.
