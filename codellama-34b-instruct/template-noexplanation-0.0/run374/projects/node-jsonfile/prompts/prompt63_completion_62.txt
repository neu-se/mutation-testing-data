  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will remove the first character of the `content` string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This code fragment will return a substring of `content` starting from the second character, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This code fragment will return a substring of `content` starting from the second character, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
