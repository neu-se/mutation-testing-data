  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.delay(value);
```

This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` will create a new async function that returns a promise that resolves with `value` after a delay of 0 milliseconds, whereas the original code returns `Q.resolve(value)` which returns a promise that resolves with `value` immediately.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(value);
```

This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will create a promise that is rejected with the reason `value`, whereas the original code returns `Q.resolve(value)` which resolves the promise.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```

This would result in different behavior because `value` is a promise, so returning it would cause the function to return a thenable, whereas the original code resolves the promise and returns its value.

DONE.
