  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of twice the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

DONE.
