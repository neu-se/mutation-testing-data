  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function once, while this modified code fragment pushes the callback function onto an array and then calls it multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function once, while this modified code fragment removes the callback function from the array and then calls it multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function once, while this modified code fragment removes the callback function from the array and then calls it multiple times.

DONE.
