  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to return the string representation of the object, rather than the object itself. This can cause the function to return a different value than expected, and may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toJSON()
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to return the JSON representation of the object, rather than the object itself. This can cause the function to return a different value than expected, and may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString().replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '')
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to return the string representation of the object, with all non-word and non-whitespace characters removed. This can cause the function to return a different value than expected, and may cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
