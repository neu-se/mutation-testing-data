  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes < lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the attributes of the two operations using the less-than operator, which may not be the intended comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the negation operator to invert the result of the `isEqual` function, which may not be the intended outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newOp.attributes.equals(lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `equals` method on the `attributes` object, which may not be the intended method to use.

DONE.
