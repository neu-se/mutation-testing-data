  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but the replaced code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not log a message to the console, but the replaced code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "This is a buggy code fragment";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return a value, but the replaced code fragment does.

DONE.
