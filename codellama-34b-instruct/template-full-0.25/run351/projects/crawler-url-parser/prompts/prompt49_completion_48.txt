  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the resulting URL to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hostname` property is used instead of the `host` property, which could result in a different URL being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl.protocol)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is used instead of the `host` property, which could result in a different URL being generated.

DONE.
