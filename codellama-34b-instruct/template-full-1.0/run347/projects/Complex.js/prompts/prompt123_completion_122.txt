  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the divisor is NaN rather than checking if it is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the divisor is zero rather than checking if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the divisor is zero rather than checking if the divisor is infinite.

DONE.
