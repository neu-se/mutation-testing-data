  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get(ends.promise.get("tail"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the `tail` property of the promise, rather than the `head` property as expected. This could cause the `get` method to never resolve or reject, leading to a deadlock.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the `undefined` property of the promise, which would be undefined. This could cause the `get` method to resolve with the value `undefined`, rather than the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the `null` property of the promise, which would be null. This could cause the `get` method to resolve with the value `null`, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
