  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(a)` would be multiplied by `b`, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - a` would be used instead of `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a) * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(a) * b` would be used instead of `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
