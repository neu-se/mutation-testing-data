  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would not pass the array of arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a nested array of arguments to the function, which would not be the same as passing the array of arguments directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenated array of arguments to the function, which would not be the same as passing the array of arguments directly.

DONE.
