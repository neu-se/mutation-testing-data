  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throughs` object is not the same as the `through` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.method()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `method()` function returns a different object than the `throughs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs.stream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stream()` function returns a different object than the `throughs` object.

DONE.
