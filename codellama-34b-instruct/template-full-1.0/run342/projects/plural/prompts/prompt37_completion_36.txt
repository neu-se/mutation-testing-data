  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(?:appendix|index)$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is different and would match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'isses' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different and would produce a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(?:appendix|index)$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different and would produce a different plural form.

DONE.
