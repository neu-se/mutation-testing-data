  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `precision` value, which could cause the `adjust()` function to incorrectly round the `latitude` and `longitude` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `precision` value by 2, which could cause the `adjust()` function to incorrectly round the `latitude` and `longitude` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the `precision` value by 2, which could cause the `adjust()` function to incorrectly round the `latitude` and `longitude` values.

DONE.
