  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object as the `archiverOptions` argument, which would cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to use the default options instead of the options provided by the `zipAFolderOptions` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `archiverOptions` argument, which would cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to use the default options instead of the options provided by the `zipAFolderOptions` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `archiverOptions` argument if `archiverOptions` is falsy, which would cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to use the default options instead of the options provided by the `zipAFolderOptions
