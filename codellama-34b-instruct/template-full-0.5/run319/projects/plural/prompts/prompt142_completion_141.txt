  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any rule that has the same word as the input word, regardless of the type of the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].includes(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any rule that has a string that includes the input word, regardless of the type of the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].startsWith(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any rule that has a string that starts with the input word, regardless of the type of the rule.

DONE.
