  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because includes would check if the passed element exists within the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because starsWith would check if the passed element starts with the specified string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because lastIndexOf would return the position of the last occurrence of a specified value in a string.

DONE.
