Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!node.isFile()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is not a file instead of checking if it's a directory, potentially allowing directory operations on files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isFile() && (flagsNum!== FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a file and the flags do not include write permission, potentially preventing write operations on files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
node.isDirectory() || (flagsNum & FLAGS.w)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the node is a directory or if the flags include write permission, potentially allowing write operations on directories.

DONE.
