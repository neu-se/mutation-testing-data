 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * value
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed callback would now multiply the value by 2 before resolving the deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed callback would now always resolve the deferred promise with null, regardless of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the progressed callback would now attempt to access the `value` property of the `promise` object, which may not exist or may have a different value.

DONE.
