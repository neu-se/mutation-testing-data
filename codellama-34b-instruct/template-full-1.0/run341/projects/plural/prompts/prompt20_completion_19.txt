  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|sh$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the 's' character is also matched by the regular expression, which is not the case for the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|(s(h)?)$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the 's' or 'sh' characters in addition to 'ch' and 'x', which is not the case for the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|ssh$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the 'ssh' characters in addition to 'ch' and 'x', which is not the case for the original
