Consider the following code fragment:
```
'use strict'

var sources  = require('./sources')
var sinks    = require('./sinks')
var throughs = require('./throughs')

exports = module.exports = require('./pull')

exports.pull = exports

for(var k in <PLACEHOLDER>)
  exports[k] = sources[k]

for(var k in throughs)
  exports[k] = throughs[k]

for(var k in sinks)
  exports[k] = sinks[k]


```

Please provide a code fragment that PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
