 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests the `data` variable directly, whereas this change would convert `data` to a string before testing it. This could cause the test to pass when it should fail, if the `data` variable is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests the `data` variable, whereas this change would always return `false` since `null` is being passed to the test function. This could cause the test to pass when it should fail, if the `data` variable is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests the `data` variable, whereas this change would pass the `test` function itself to the `filter` function. This could cause the test to pass when it should fail, if the `test` function does
