  Sure, my pleasured to help. Here are three possible mutants and their behavior differences:

Option 1:
```
var x = new Complex(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new instance of the Complex class, rather than returning a modified version of the original object.

Option 2:
```
if (z['im'] === 0) {
    return new Complex(b, a);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the real and imaginary components of the returned object, so the resulting object would have the opposite value in the real and imaginary components as the original object.

Option 3:
```
return new Complex(a * z['re'], b * z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because itmultiplies the real and imaginary components of the original object by the real and imaginary components of the divisor, so the resulting object would have a different magnitude and phase than the original object.

DONE.
