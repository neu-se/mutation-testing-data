  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer || null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `replacer` is not defined, it would return `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `replacer` before passing it to `JSON.stringify()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of `replacer` to a string before passing it to `JSON.stringify()`.

DONE.
