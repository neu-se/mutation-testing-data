  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for an empty string input, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the input string contains an empty string, which is different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for any non-null input, which is different from the original code.

DONE.
