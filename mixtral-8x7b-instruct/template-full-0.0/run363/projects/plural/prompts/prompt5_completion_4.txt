 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a property in an object, rather than returning the object's internal `[[Class]]` information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.toString
