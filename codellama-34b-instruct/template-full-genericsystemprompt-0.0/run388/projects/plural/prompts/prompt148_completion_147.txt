  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original word, while this replacement returns the word in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original word, while this replacement returns the word without the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original word, while this replacement returns the word with the characters in reverse order.

DONE.
