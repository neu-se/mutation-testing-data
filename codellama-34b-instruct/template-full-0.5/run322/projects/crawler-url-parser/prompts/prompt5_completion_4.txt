  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the pathname of the URL has illegal characters, instead of the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.search)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the search query of the URL has illegal characters, instead of the entire URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.hash)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the hash of the URL has illegal characters, instead of the entire URL.

DONE.
