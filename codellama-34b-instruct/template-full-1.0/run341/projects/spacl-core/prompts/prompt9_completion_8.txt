  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?!\/)\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the lookahead assertion `(?!\/)` checks that the current character is not a forward slash, which is not the case in the original code `/\/\//`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` quantifier matches one or more forward slashes, while the original code fragment only matches a single forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z]/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[a-zA-Z]` matches any letter, while the original code fragment only matches a forward slash.

DONE.
