  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would still consider it an object and continue executing the function, while this new code would return `undefined` immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it an object and continue executing the function, while this new code would return `undefined` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(b, 'constructor')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, while this new
