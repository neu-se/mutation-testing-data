  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `offset` variable to compute the substring, while this new code uses the `length` variable, which could lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `offset` variable to compute the substring, while this new code uses the `length` variable, which could lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `offset` variable to compute the substring, while this new code uses the `length` variable, which could lead to different results.

DONE.
