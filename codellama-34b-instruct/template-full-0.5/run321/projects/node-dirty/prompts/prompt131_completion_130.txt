  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map object, and `this._queue` is a Set object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size` is a number, and `this._data` is a Map object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.values()` is an iterator object, and `this._data` is a Map object.

DONE.
