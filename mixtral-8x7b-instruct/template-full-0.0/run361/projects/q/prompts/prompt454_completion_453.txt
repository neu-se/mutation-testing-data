 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"<an error occurred>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would always be the same, regardless of the reason for rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the reason object to a string, which might not include the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error().stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always show the stack trace of a new error object, not the original reason for rejection.

DONE.
