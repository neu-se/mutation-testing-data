  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop` would remove the last element from the `parts` array, whereas `parts.push` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.shift` would remove the first element from the `parts` array, whereas `parts.push` would add an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the `parts` array, whereas `parts.push` would add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
