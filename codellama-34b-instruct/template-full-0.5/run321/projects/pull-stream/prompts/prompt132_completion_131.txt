  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the mutated code decrements `i` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the mutated code adds 1 to `i` without assigning the result back to `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the mutated code multiplies `i` by 2.

DONE.
