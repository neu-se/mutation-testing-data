  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `void 0`, and would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `void 0`, and would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` is a different function than `void 0`, and would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
