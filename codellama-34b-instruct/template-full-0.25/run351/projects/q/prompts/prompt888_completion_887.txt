  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called with a single argument, `0`, which is a falsy value. In contrast, the replaced code fragment would call the `then` method with no arguments, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called with a single argument, `1`, which is a truthy value. In contrast, the replaced code fragment would call the `then` method with two arguments, `2` and `0`, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called with a single argument, `1`, which is a
