  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid complex number");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the complex number is invalid, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a special value (NaN) when the complex number is invalid, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0, which would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
