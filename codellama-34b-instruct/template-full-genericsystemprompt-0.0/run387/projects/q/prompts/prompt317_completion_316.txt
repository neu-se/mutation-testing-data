  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise` prototype, while `null` would result in a `TypeError` when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise` prototype, while `undefined` would result in a `TypeError` when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise` prototype, while `{}` would result in a new object with the `Object` prototype.

DONE.
