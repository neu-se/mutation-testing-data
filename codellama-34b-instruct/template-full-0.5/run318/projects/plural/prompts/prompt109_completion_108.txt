  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace the word with itself, while this new code fragment would remove the last character of the word before returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word as is, while this new code fragment would return the word in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat
