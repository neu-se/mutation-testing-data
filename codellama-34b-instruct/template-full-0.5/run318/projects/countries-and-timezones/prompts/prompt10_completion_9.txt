  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `result` object has a property `country` that is `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `result` object does not have a property `country`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `result` object has a property `country` that is not `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `result` object does not have a property `country`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `result` object has a property `country` that is `null`, whereas the original code fragment would check if the `result` object does not have a property `country`.

DONE.
