  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exit the parser with a non-zero exit code, indicating an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a random sign to the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of using the sign of the '-' token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the next token, instead of the '-' token, to the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
