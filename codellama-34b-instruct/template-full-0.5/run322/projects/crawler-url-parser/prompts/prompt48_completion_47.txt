  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` parameter is set to `false`, which means that the URL will not be resolved against the base URL, even if one is provided. This could cause the `parse` function to return a different URL than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `baseUrl` and `slashesDenoteHost` parameters are set to `false`, which means that the URL will not be
