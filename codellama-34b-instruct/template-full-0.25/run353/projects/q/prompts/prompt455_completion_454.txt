  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`, the `!` operator would return `true`, but the `===` operator would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for value inequality, whereas the `!` operator only checks for value equality. In this case, if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`, the `!=` operator would return `true`, but the `!` operator would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method returns the primitive value of the object
