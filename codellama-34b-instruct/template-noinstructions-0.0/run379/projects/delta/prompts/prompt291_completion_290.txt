  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `indexOf` method to be called on the `insert` property of `thisOp`, which is a string, instead of the `insert` property of `otherOp`, which is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = otherOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `indexOf` method to be called on the `insert` property of `otherOp`, which is an object, instead of the `insert` property of `thisOp`, which is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `indexOf` method to be called on the `start` variable, which is a number, instead of the `insert` property of either
