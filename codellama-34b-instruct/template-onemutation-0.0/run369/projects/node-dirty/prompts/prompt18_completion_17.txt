  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, whereas `cbs` by itself would pass the original array by reference. This could cause the `set` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
