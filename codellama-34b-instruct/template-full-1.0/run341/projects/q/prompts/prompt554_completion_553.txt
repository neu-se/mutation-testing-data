  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function would be called with the promised `result`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with the expected value.

DONE.
