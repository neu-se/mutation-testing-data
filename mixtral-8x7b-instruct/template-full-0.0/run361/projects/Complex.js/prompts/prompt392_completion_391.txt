 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by `b` only when it is non-zero, while this change would cause a division by zero error when `b` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates `d` using `Math.cos(2 * b)`, while this change would use `Math.cos(2 * a)` instead, which would result in different values for `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` from the object properties, while this change would use `this.re` instead, which would result in different values for the calculation.

DONE.
