 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `test` method instead of `match`, and also has a slight change in the regular expression pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `match` method on the `spec` property of the current object, instead of just `spec`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]:|:\/|:$/.exec(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `exec` method instead of `match`, and also has a slight change in the regular expression pattern.

DONE.
