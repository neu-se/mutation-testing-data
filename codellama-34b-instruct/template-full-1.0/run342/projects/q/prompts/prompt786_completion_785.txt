  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the first two arguments are both `void 0`, which means that the promise will never be resolved or rejected, and the test will time out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is `rejected`, which means that the promise will be rejected, but the first and third arguments are both `void 0`, which means that the test will not be able to detect the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is `resolved`, which means that the promise will be resolved, but the first and second arguments are both `void 0`, which means that the test will not be able to detect the resolution.

DONE.
