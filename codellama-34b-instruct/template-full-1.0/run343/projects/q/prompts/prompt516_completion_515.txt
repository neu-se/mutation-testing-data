  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `.catch` will handle rejected promises, whereas `.then` will handle fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.tap
```
This would result in different behavior because `.tap` will not affect the resolution of the promise, but it can be used to observe the promise's state without invoking the rejection handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because `.spread` will spread the resolved promise value into an array of arguments, whereas `.then` will pass the resolved value as the first argument to the fulfillment handler.

DONE.
