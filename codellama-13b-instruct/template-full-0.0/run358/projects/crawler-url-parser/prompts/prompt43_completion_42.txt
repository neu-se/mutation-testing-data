  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` for any input that is not a valid URL, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for any input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would throw an error for any input that is not a valid URL, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for any input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` for any input that is not a valid URL, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for any input.

DONE.
