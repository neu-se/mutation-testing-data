  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is called immediately, rather than being scheduled to run later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick()` is called recursively, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is called after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, rather than immediately.

DONE.
