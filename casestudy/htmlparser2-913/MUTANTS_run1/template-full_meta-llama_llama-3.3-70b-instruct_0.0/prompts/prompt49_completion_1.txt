Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.tokenizer.getAbsoluteIndex() - this.startIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the offset based on the current `startIndex` and `tokenizer` index, rather than using a fixed value of 2, which could lead to incorrect indexing in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a constant value of 1 instead of 2, which could affect the positioning and event handling of the parser, potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete parsing of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.endIndex - this.startIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the offset based on the difference between the current `endIndex` and `startIndex`, rather than using a fixed value, which could lead to incorrect indexing and affect the parser's event handling logic.

DONE.
