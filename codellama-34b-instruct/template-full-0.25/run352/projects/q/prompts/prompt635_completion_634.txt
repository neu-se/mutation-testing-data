  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property from an object, and passing `null` as the object would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property from an object, and passing `undefined` as the object would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property from an object, and passing an empty object as the object would result in the property being deleted from the object.

DONE.
