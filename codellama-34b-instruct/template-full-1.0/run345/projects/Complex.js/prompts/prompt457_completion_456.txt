  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator "-" changes the result of the original code, which is undesirable for a method that checks whether a complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the method checks whether a complex number is finite instead of infinite, which could cause incorrect results in other parts of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the method checks whether the imaginary part of a complex number is not a number (NaN) instead of checking whether the complex number is infinite, which could cause incorrect results in other parts of the program.

DONE.
