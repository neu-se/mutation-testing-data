  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `closed` promise is rejected, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `closed` promise is rejected, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment would throw an error with a different message.

DONE.
