  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is explicitly returned, whereas `undefined` is returned by default if no value is specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is explicitly returned if `i >= array.length`, whereas `false` would be returned if `i < array.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is explicitly returned if `i >= array.length`, whereas `0` would be returned if `i < array.length`.

DONE.
