  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrl` argument to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code. This would cause the `parse` function to use the `baseUrl` as the base URL when parsing the URL, which could result in different behavior if the `baseUrl` is different from the original base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function on the `baseUrl` object, which is not present in the original code. This would cause the `parse` function to be called on the `baseUrl` object, which could result in different behavior if the `baseUrl` object has a `parse` function that behaves differently from the original `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, baseUrl.url)
