  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `promise` resolves, the `then` method will receive `null` instead of the actual value, which could cause unexpected errors or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `promise` resolves, the `then` method will receive `undefined` instead of the actual value, which could cause unexpected errors or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promise
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `promise` resolves, the `then` method will receive `false` instead of the actual value, which could cause unexpected errors or behavior.

DONE.
