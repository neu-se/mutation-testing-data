  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return read
+ return abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` and `abort` are different variables, and `abort` is not a function. In the original code, `read` is called as a function, which would result in an error if it is not a function. However, with the replaced code, `abort` is not a function, so it will not be called as one, and no error will be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- return read
+ return true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value, while `read` is a variable that is expected to be a function. In the original code, `read` is called as a function, which would result in an error if it is not a function. However, with the replaced code, `true` is not a function, so it will not be called as one, and no error will be thrown.
