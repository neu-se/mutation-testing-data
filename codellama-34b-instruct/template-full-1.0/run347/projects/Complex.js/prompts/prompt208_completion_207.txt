  Option 1: The `Math.atan2` function can be replaced with `Math.acos`:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` takes only one argument, whereas `Math.atan2` takes two.

Option 2: The `Math.atan2` function can be replaced with `Math.acos(b, a)`:
```
Math.acos(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` takes only one argument, whereas `Math.atan2` takes two.

Option 3: The `Math.atan2` function can be replaced with `Math.atan(a/b)`:
```
Math.atan(a/b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` takes only one argument, whereas `Math.atan2` takes two.

DONE.
