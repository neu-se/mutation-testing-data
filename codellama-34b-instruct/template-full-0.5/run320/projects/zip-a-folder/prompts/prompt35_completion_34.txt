  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is not called on the `zipArchive` object, which would prevent the archive from being written to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('some_other_file.zip'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method is called on the `zipArchive` object, but the output stream is a different file than the one specified in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output, { end: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option is set to `false`, which would prevent the archive from being finalized and written to the output stream.

DONE.
