  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which means that the `if` statement would be evaluated as `if (false === <PLACEHOLDER>(data) || abort)` instead of `if (op === <PLACEHOLDER>(data) || abort)`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `op` is not equal to `data`, which would result in the `read` function being called with `abort` set to `true`, even if `op` is not equal to `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `op`, which means that the `if` statement would be evaluated as `if (op + 1 === <PLACEHOLDER>(data) || abort)` instead of `if (op === <PLACEHOLDER>(data) || abort
