Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `object` would cause the `dispatch` function to potentially operate on a null reference, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the `object` would similarly lead to errors when attempting to access properties or methods, as `undefined` does not have any properties or methods, which would cause a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `object` with a string literal would change the expected type for the `dispatch` function, which may lead to incorrect handling of operations that are intended for objects, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
