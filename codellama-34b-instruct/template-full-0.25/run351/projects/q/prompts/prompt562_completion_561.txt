  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q(exception.value)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of `exception.value`, while the modified code fragment `Q.reject(exception.value)` creates a new promise that is rejected with the value of `exception.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q(exception.value)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of `exception.value`, while the modified code fragment `Q.resolve(exception.value)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of `exception.value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q(exception.value)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value
