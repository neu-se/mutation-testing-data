  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a different object than `Promise.prototype`, and the code would likely fail to work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Promise.prototype` is an object that provides the methods for creating and manipulating promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Promise.prototype` is an object that provides the methods for creating and manipulating promises.

DONE.
