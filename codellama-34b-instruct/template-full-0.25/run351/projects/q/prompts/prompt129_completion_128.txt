  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the index `i` to the `keys` array instead of the property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of the property `key` to the `keys` array instead of the property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the property name plus 1 to the `keys` array instead of the property name.

DONE.
