 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the imaginary part of the current complex number instead of the input `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.valueOf() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the input `b` to a number before comparing, which might not be desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different comparison operator, which might not behave as expected for certain input values.

DONE.
