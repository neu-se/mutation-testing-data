  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, which could affect the `ret.baseurl` property and the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.format()` method would return a different string, which could affect the `baseUrlStr` variable and the resulting URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.resolve()` method would return a different URL object, which could affect the `currentUrlStr` variable and the resulting URL.

DONE.
