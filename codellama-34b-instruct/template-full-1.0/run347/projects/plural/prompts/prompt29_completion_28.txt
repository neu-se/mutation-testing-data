  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr()` method is called on the `w` variable with the argument `0`, which would return the entire string. Then, the length of the string is subtracted by 2, and `'is'` is concatenated to the end of the string, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substring(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method is called on the `w` variable with the argument `0`, which would return a copy of the string from the start index to the end index. Then, the length of the string is subtracted by 2, and `'es'` is concaten
