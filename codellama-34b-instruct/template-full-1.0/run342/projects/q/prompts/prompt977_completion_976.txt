  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a deferred object, which was not the intention of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a deferred object, which was not the intention of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a deferred object, which was not the intention of the original code.

DONE.
