 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Buggy behavior'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of executing the `bootstrap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to `bootstrap` instead of executing it, which could cause subsequent calls to `bootstrap` to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `undefined` instead of executing the `bootstrap` function, which could cause subsequent calls to `bootstrap` to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
