  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a value even if `a` and `b` are not equal to zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a value even if `a` or `b` is equal to zero, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a value even if `a` or `b` is not equal to zero, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
