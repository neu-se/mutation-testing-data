  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the real part of the complex number, regardless of whether it is finite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the imaginary part of the complex number plus one, regardless of whether it is finite or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the imaginary part of the complex number multiplied by two, regardless of whether it is finite or not.

DONE.
