  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `data` variable directly, but `data.value` would retrieve the `value` property of the `data` object. This could cause the `op()` function to receive a different value than expected, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `data` variable directly, but `data * 2` would multiply the `data` value by 2. This could cause the `op()` function to receive a different value than expected, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `data` variable directly, but `'string'` would pass a string value to the `op()` function.
