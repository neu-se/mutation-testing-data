  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, even when the input is not infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] || this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to always return `Complex['NAN']`, even when the input is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite'] && !this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to always return `Complex['ZERO']`, even when the input is not zero.

DONE.
