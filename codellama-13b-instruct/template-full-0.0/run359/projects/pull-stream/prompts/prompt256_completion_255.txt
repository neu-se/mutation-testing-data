  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with a null `_read` value, which would result in an error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with an undefined `_read` value, which would result in an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with a non-function value for `_read`, which would result in an error being thrown.

DONE.
