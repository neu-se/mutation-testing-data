Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the inclusion of attributes where the values are equal, which is not the intended logic of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `null` values in `attr` as a condition to include the key, ignoring other potential values that should be compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] === undefined && attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include keys from `base` only when they are `undefined`, which contradicts the original logic that checks for differences between `base` and `attr`.

DONE.
