  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
box.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more character than the original code, potentially causing an off-by-one error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
box.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one fewer character than the original code, potentially causing an off-by-one error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
box.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain twice as many characters as the original code, potentially causing an off-by-one error.

DONE.
