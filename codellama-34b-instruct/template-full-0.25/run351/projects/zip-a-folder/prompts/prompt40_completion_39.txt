  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, rather than an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of words, and then return the length of the array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split("").reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, and then reverse the order of the characters, rather than returning the original string.

DONE.
