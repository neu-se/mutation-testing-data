  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '**')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match files in subdirectories as well, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '?')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match files with any single character, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace('*', '[a-zA-Z0-9_-]')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match files with any alphanumeric character, underscore, or hyphen, which may not be intended.

DONE.
