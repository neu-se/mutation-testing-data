  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method of the `Delta` class that is not related to pushing an element to an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method of the `Delta` class that is not related to pushing an element to an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method of the `Delta` class that is not related to pushing an element to an array.

DONE.
