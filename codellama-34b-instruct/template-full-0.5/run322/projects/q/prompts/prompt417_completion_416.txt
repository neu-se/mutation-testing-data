  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the object, which may have a different implementation than the original code fragment that simply accessed the `inspect` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `object.inspect`, which may cause the comparison to fail if the result is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the result of `object.inspect` to a string, which may cause the comparison to fail if the result is not a string.

DONE.
