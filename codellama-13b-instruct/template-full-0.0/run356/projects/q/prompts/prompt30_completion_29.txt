  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element from the array, while the `pop` method removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes the first element from the array, while the `pop` method removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array containing the first element of the original array, while the `pop` method removes the last element.

DONE.
