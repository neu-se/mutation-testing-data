  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is computing the exponential of the absolute value of `x`, which is a complex number, while the replaced code fragment is computing the exponential of the square of `x`, which is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is computing the exponential of the absolute value of `x`, which is a complex number, while the replaced code fragment is computing the exponential of the reciprocal of `x`, which is also a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is computing the exponential of the absolute value of `x`, which is a complex number, while the replaced code fragment is computing the exponential of the sum of `x` and itself, which is a real number.

DONE.
