  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called with a function that always returns the original `value`, regardless of the fulfillment value of the promise. In the original code, the `then` method is called with a function that returns the result of `_fulfilled(value)`, which may be different from `value` if the `_fulfilled` function modifies it.

DONE.
