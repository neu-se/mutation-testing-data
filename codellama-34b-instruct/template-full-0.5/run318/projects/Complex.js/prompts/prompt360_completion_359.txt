  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is incremented by 1, which could potentially change the outcome of the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is multiplied by 2, which could potentially change the outcome of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is decremented by 1, which could potentially change the outcome of the `cosh` function.

DONE.
