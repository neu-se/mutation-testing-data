 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.thenResolve` function would always return a promise that is immediately resolved with `undefined`, regardless of the input promise. Originally, it resolves to the input promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` would always return a newly created (empty) promise, instead of resolving the input promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('An error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` would always reject the returned promise with the string 'An error', instead of resolving it with the provided value.

DONE.
