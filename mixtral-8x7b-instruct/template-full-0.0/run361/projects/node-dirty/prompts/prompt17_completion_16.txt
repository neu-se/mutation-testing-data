 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Symbol()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol()` creates a unique symbol that cannot be used as a key in a `Map` object, causing the `set` method to fail silently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the `key` argument to `this._queue.set()` would cause a TypeError, since `Map` cannot have `null` as a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'some-random-key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'some-random-key'` is not the same as the `key` variable, causing the `cbs` array to not contain the correct callbacks for the given key.

DONE.
