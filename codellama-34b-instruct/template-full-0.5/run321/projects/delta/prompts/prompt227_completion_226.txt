  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `component[1]` would refer to the second element of the `component` array, which may not be a valid operation for the given `component` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `component[2]` would refer to the third element of the `component` array, which may not be a valid operation for the given `component` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `component.length` would refer to the length of the `component` array, which may not be a valid operation for the given `component` array.

DONE.
