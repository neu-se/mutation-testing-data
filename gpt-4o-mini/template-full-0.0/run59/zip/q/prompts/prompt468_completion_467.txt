Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event indicating that the rejection has been handled, which is not the intended behavior of tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event for unhandled rejections instead of the intended event for handled rejections, potentially leading to confusion in the handling of promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a generic error event instead of the specific "rejectionHandled" event, which could lead to a loss of context regarding the nature of the promise rejection.

DONE.
