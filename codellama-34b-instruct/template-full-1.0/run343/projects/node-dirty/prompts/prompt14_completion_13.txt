  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the callback to the list of callbacks, it would remove the last callback from the list, which could cause the callback to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the callback to the list of callbacks, it would remove the first callback from the list, which could cause the callback to never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, cbs.length, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the callback to the list of callbacks, it would replace all callbacks with the new callback, which could cause callbacks that were previously added to the list to never be called.

DONE.
