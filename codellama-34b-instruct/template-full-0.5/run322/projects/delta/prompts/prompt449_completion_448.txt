  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is now being checked for a value that is not a number, whereas the original code checked for a value that is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is now being checked for a value that is not an object, whereas the original code checked for a value that is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is now being checked for a value that is undefined, whereas the original code checked for a value that is a number.

DONE.
