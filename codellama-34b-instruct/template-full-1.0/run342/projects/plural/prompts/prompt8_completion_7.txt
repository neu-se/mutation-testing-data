  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the pluralization function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is null, which would cause the pluralization function to return the wrong plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is incremented by 1, which would cause the pluralization function to return the wrong plural form.

DONE.
