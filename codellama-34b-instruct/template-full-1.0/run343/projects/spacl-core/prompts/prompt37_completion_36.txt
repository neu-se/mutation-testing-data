  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let reversed = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would correctly reverse the array, whereas the original code fragment has a bug where it doesn't reverse the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let parts = spec.split('/').slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would correctly extract the parts of the regex from the spec string, whereas the original code fragment has a bug where it incorrectly reverses the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let parts = spec.split('/');
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would correctly split the spec string into parts, whereas the original code fragment has a bug where it incorrectly reverses the array.

DONE.
