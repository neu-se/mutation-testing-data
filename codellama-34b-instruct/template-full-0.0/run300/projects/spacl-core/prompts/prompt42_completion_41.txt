  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the first character of the part, rather than the entire part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire part except for the first character, rather than the entire part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire part except for the last character, rather than the entire part.

DONE.
