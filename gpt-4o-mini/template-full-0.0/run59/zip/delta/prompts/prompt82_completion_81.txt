Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift({ insert: 'default' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new operation with a default string instead of the intended `newOp`, which could lead to unexpected results in the operation sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift({ delete: 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a delete operation instead of the intended `newOp`, which would alter the state of the operations by removing one character instead of inserting or retaining content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift({ retain: 0 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a retain operation with a length of 0, which effectively does nothing but could lead to confusion in the operation sequence, as it does not represent a valid operation compared to the intended `newOp`.

DONE.
