  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is finite instead of being NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is zero instead of being NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it checks if the complex number is infinite instead of being NaN.

DONE.
