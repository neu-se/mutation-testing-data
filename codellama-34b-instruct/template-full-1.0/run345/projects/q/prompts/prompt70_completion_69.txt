  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be constructed with a different name, causing the `onmessage` event to not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be constructed with a null value, causing the `postMessage` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` would be constructed with a string value, causing the `postMessage` method to throw an error.

DONE.
