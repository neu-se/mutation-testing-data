  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than fulfilled, which would cause the `then` method to return a rejected promise with the rejection reason as the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be in a pending state, rather than fulfilled, which would cause the `then` method to return a pending promise that will eventually be fulfilled with the progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new rejection reason, rather than fulfilled with the original value, which would cause the `then` method to return a rejected promise with the new rejection reason.

DONE.
