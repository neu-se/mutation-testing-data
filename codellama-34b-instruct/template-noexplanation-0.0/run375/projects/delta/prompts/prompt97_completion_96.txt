  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This will cause the `splice` method to insert the new op at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This will cause the `splice` method to insert the new op at the end of the `ops` array, rather than at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
```
This will cause the `splice` method to insert the new op at a random position in the `ops` array.

DONE.
