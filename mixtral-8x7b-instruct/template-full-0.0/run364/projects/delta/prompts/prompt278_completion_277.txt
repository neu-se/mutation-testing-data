 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `index` variable to be incorrect, potentially causing the `predicate` function to be called with the wrong line or attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER> * 2)
