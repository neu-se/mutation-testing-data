  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called twice if the `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` promise is rejected, which would cause the `deferred.reject` function to be called twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called if the `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs)` promise is rejected, which would cause the `deferred.resolve` function to be called instead of the `deferred.reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function () {}` function would be
