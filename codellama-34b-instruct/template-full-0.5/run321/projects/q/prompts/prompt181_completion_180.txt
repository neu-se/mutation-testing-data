  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether or not a pattern exists in a string, whereas `exec` is a method that returns an array of matches or `null` if no match is found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches or `null` if no match is found, whereas `exec` returns an array of matches or `null` if no match is found, but also includes the matched string and the index of the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.search
```
This would result in different behavior because
