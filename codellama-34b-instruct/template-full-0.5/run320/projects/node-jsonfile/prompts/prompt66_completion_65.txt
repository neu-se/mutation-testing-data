  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, which is what the original code fragment was designed to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0001/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, which is what the original code fragment was designed to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0002/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, which is what the original code fragment was designed to do.

DONE.
