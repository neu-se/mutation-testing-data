  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `a` in a different order than the original code, which could cause the `compose` function to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, which could cause the `compose` function to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
  if (a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined) {
    attributes[key] = a[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set the value of `attributes[key]` to `a[key]` if `a[key]` is not undefined and `b[key]` is undefined, whereas the original code
