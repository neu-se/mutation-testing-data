  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the code to increment the `insert` property of the `op` object, which would likely lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator would cause the code to delete the `insert` property of the `op` object, which would likely lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` operator would cause the code to retain the `insert` property of the `op` object, which would likely lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
