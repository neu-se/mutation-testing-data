  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a dot.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g, '\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a dot and replaces it with a dollar sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g, '\\$1'

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a dot and replaces it with a dollar sign.

DONE.
