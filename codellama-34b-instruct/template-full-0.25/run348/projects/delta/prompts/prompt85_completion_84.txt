  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to be set to `null`, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the `attributes` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to be set to `undefined`, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to be set to an empty object, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses the `attributes` property.

DONE.
