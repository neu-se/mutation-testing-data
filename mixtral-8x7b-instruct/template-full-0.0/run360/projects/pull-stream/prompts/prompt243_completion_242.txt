 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `nextStream` function would never be called. This could cause the function to stop processing new streams after the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `nextStream` function would never be called. This could cause the function to stop processing new streams after the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `true`, and the `nextStream` function would never be called. This could cause the function to stop processing new streams after the first one.

DONE.
