  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the base index by 1, regardless of the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always decrement the base index by the length of the operation, regardless of the operation type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the base index by twice the length of the operation, regardless of the operation type.

DONE.
