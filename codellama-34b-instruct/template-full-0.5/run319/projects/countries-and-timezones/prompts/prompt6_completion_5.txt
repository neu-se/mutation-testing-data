Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return an object with a `foo` property instead of an object with timezones, causing the `buildCountry` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the
