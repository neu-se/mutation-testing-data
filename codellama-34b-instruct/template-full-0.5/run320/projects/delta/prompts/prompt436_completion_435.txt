  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's a string. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nextOp.delete` is a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it's an object. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nextOp.delete` is an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while
