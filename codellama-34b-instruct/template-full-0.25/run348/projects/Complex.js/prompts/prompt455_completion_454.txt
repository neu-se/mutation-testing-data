  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is finite, while `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite, while `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!this['isNaN']` would return `true` if the number is not NaN, while `this['isNaN']` would return `true` if the number is NaN.

DONE.
