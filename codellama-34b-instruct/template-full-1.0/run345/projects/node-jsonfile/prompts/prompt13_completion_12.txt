  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object, while the mutated code returns `null`. This could cause issues if the returned value is used in further code execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if the `reviver` option is not provided, while the mutated code returns an empty object. This could cause issues if the returned value is used in further code execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if the `reviver` option is not provided, while the mutated code returns the string `'foo'`. This could cause issues if the returned value is used in further code execution.

DONE.
