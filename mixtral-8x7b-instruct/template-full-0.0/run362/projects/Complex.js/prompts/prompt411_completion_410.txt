 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a == 0 && b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses abstract equality (`==`) instead of strict equality (`===`), which can lead to unexpected type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `a` or `b` being equal to zero instead of both being equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the product of `a` and `b` is equal to zero, which would be true if either `a` or `b` is zero, not necessarily both.

DONE.
