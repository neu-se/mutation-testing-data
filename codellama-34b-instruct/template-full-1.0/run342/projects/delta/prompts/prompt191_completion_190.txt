  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ type: 'retain', attributes: otherOp.retain }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the operation from "retain" to "retain attributes". While the original code preserved the original attributes and only overrided them if the attibutes were different, this new code would always override the attributes, potentially causing changes in the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ type: 'delete', length: otherOp.delete }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the operation from "retain" to "delete". This would cause the program to delete content instead of retaining it, potentially causing changes in the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ type: 'insert', length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the operation from "retain" to "insert". This would cause the program
