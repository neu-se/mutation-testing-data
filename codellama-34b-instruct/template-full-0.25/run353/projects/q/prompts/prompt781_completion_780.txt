  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(regardless, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of the value returned by `regardless`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(regardless, function () { throw new Error("rejected"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error instead of being resolved with the value returned by `regardless`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(regardless, function () { return Q.reject(new Error("rejected")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a new error instead of being resolved with the value returned by `regardless`.

DONE.
