  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function when the `ended` variable is true, but the new code fragment calls the `cb` function unconditionally. This could cause the function to return data even after it has been ended, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
