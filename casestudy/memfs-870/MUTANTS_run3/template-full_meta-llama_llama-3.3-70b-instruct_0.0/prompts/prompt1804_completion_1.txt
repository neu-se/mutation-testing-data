Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to open a different file, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior if the file does not exist or is not accessible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.getResolvedLink(filename).getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the resolved path of the link instead of the original filename, potentially affecting the behavior of the `openSync` method if the link points to a different location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./' + filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to open the file in the current working directory, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior if the file does not exist or is not accessible in that location.

DONE.
