  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would not be executed, even if the `match` method returns `null`, which would cause the method to return `null` instead of the `RegExpMatchArray` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would not be executed, even if the `match` method returns `null`, which would cause the method to return `undefined` instead of the `RegExpMatchArray` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would not be executed, even if the `match` method returns `null`, which would cause the method to return `null` instead of the `RegExpMatchArray` object.

DONE.
