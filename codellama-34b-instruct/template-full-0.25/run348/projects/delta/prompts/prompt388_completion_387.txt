  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `length` is a string. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `otherIter.peekLength()` returns a string. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` expects a number as an argument, but `otherIter.peekLength() + 1` returns a string. This would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
