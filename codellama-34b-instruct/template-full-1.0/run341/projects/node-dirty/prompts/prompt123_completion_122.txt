  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method recursively, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.flush
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `flush` property of the `Dirty` object, which does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Dirty.prototype.flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` method on the `Dirty` prototype, which is not the same as calling the method on the current instance of `Dirty`.

DONE.
