  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is `Infinity`. Using `isNaN` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases, such as when the input is `NaN`.

DONE.
