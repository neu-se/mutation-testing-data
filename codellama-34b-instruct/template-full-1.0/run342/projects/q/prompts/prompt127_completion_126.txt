  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the next element in the object, rather than the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at the first element in the object, rather than the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key = <random_key>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at a random element in the object, rather than the current element.

DONE.
