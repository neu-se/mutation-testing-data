  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `cb` is called with `null` as the first argument.

```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `cb` is called with `null` as the first argument.
