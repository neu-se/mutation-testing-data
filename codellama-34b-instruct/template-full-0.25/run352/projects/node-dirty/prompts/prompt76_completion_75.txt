  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, indicating that the database is not empty, even if it actually is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `-1`, indicating that the database is empty, even if it actually is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with the actual size of the database, rather than a hardcoded value.

DONE.
