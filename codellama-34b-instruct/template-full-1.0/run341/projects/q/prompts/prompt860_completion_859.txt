  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would never be called, as the `throw` statement inside the `then` block would cause the promise to be rejected, and the `catch` block would be executed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would never be called, as the `throw` statement inside the `then` block would cause the promise to be rejected, and the `catch` block would be executed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would never be called, as the `throw` statement inside the `then` block would cause the promise to be rejected, and the `catch` block would be executed instead.

DONE.
