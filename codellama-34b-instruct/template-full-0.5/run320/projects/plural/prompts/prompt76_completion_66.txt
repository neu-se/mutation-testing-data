  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "dice", while this modified code fragment returns the string "dice1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "dice", while this modified code fragment returns the string "dicedice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "dice", while this modified code fragment returns the character "d".

DONE.
