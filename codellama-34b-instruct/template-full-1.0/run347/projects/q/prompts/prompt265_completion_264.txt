  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value + 1` expression would result in a different value than `value`, which is the expected return value from the fulfillment callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value * 2` expression would result in a different value than `value`, which is the expected return value from the fulfillment callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` expression would result in a different value than `value`, which is the expected return value from the fulfillment callback.

DONE.
