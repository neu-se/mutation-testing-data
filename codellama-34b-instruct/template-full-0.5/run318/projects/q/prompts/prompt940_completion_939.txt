  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the first argument, but this modified code fragment excludes it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not concatenate any additional elements to the array slice, while this modified code fragment concatenates the value `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment preserves the order of the arguments, while this modified code fragment reverses their order.

DONE.
