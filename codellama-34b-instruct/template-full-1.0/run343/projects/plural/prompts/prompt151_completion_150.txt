  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, rather than the original object that the method was called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and does not have any properties that can be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object, and cannot be used to access any properties or methods.

DONE.
