  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `compile` function with the `spec` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called the `compile` function with the `spec` argument and assigned the result to the `regex` and `props` variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.0')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `compile` function with the `spec` argument and the `version` argument set to `'1.0'`, which is not the same as the original code fragment that called the `compile` function with the `spec` argument and assigned the result to the `regex` and `props` variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec, '1.1')
```
This would result in different behavior
