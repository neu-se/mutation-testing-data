  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new Q promise is created, which may have a different behavior than the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is resolved as a promise, which may have a different behavior than the original promise.

DONE.
