  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peekLength(this.index)` would return the length of the current op, whereas `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the length of the op at the specified index. If the index is different from the current index, the behavior of the `hasNext()` method would be affected.

DONE.
