  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function is not called with the correct number of arguments, leading to a different promise chain execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { throw error }
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function is called when the promise is rejected, leading to a different promise chain execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` object is not a function, leading to a different promise chain execution.

DONE.
