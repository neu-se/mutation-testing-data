  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number and `op.attributes` is null, while the new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object and `op.attributes` is null. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `op.retain` is a number and `op.attributes` is not null.

DONE.
