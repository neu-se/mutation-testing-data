  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.pop(1)` would remove the first element of the buffer, whereas the original code `buffer.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would remove the last element of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.pop(buffer.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.pop(buffer.length - 1)` would remove the last element of the buffer, whereas the original code `buffer.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would remove the first element of the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.pop(buffer.length / 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.pop(buffer.length / 2)` would remove an element from the middle of the buffer, whereas the original code `buffer.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would remove the first
