  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable as a string, while the `instanceof` operator returns a boolean indicating whether the variable is an instance of the specified type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.constructor.name === "String"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor.name` property returns the name of the constructor function that created the object, while the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(linkurl) === "[object String]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.prototype.toString` method returns a string representing the object, while the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable as a string.

DONE.
