  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method immediately, instead of waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with a `null` argument, which would cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with a `true` argument, which would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
