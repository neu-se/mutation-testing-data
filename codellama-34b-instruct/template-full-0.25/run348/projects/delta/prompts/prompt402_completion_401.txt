  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the embed type in the `otherData` object is now 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `handler.transform` method to be called with different arguments and potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `null` would cause the `handler.transform` method to be called only if the `otherData` object has a non-null value for the embed type, which could result in different behavior if the `handler.transform` method has different behavior for null and non-null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[0] && otherData[embedType] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because
