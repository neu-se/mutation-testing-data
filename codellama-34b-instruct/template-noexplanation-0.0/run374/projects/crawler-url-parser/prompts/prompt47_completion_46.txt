  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol
```
This change will cause the `URL.format()` method to use the protocol of the base URL, rather than the protocol of the current URL. This could potentially cause issues if the base URL has a different protocol than the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This change will cause the `URL.format()` method to use the host of the base URL, rather than the host of the current URL. This could potentially cause issues if the base URL has a different host than the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname
```
This change will cause the `URL.format()` method to use the pathname of the base URL, rather than the pathname of the current URL. This could potentially cause issues if the base URL has a different pathname than the current URL.

DONE.
