Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.statusCode + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a different HTTP status code in the response, potentially affecting how the client handles the response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
res.statusCode
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `statusCode` property of the `res` object instead of `this`, which could potentially be different if the context of `this` has changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always send a status code of 200 (OK), regardless of the actual status code that was intended to be sent, potentially masking errors or other issues.

DONE.
