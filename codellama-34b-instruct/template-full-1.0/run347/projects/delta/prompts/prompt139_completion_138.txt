  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the other iterator's next op, rather than the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the current op in the this iterator, rather than the length of the current op in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the next op in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current op in the this iterator.

DONE.
