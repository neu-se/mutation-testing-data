  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not
```
This code fragment is a reference to the `not` method of the `tester` object, which is not a valid method in the context of the `filterNot` function. This mutation will cause the function to throw an error when it is called, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not(test)
```
This code fragment is a call to the `not` method of the `tester` object, passing in the `test` function as an argument. This mutation will cause the function to return the opposite of what it should, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.

This code fragment is a call to the `not` method of the `tester` object, passing in
