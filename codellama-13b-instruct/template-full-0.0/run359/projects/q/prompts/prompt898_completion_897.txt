  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function to the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the result of the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to the `nodeArgs` array. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the deferred resolver function to the `nodeArgs` array, while the modified code fragment unshifts the result of the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to the `nodeArgs` array. This could potentially cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(node
