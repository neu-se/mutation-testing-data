  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated` is a boolean value, and the original code fragment `options` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated = true` is an assignment statement, and the original code fragment `options` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : options
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : options` is a ternary expression, and the original code fragment `options` is an object.

DONE.
