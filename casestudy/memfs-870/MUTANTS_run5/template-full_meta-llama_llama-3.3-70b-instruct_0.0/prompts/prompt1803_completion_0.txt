Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.open
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.open` is an asynchronous method that returns a callback, whereas `this.openSync` is a synchronous method that returns the file descriptor directly, so the code would not wait for the file to be opened before trying to use the file descriptor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.openBase
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.openBase` might have a different implementation or parameters than `this.openSync`, potentially leading to different file opening behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.readFile` is a method for reading the contents of a file, not for opening it, so it would not return a file descriptor and would likely cause an error when trying to use it as one.

DONE.
