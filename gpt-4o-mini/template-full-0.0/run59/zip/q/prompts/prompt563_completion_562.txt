Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `exception.value` would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results in the calling code that expects the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string literal like `"Error occurred"` instead of `exception.value` would change the type of the resolved value from whatever the original exception's value was to a fixed string, which may not provide useful information about the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `exception.message` instead of `exception.value` would provide only the error message string rather than the entire exception object, potentially losing important context or data that was part of the original exception.

DONE.
