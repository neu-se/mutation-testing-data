  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.valueOf = function() { return this.re + this.im; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `valueOf` method returns `null` if the imaginary part is not zero, while the new method returns the sum of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isNaN = function() { return this.re === NaN || this.im === NaN; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `isNaN` method checks if either the real or imaginary part is `NaN`, while the new method checks if both parts are `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isFinite = function() { return isFinite(this.re) && isFinite(this.im); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `isFinite` method checks if the real part is finite and the imaginary
