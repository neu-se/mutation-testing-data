  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of an array, while `size` is a property of a map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a method of a map, while `length` is a property of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
