 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line, {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the attributes of the next operation, which could be important for the predicate function to make correct decisions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Delta(), {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Delta object with no operations, which changes the behavior of the `eachLine` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line, iter.next(1), i + 1
