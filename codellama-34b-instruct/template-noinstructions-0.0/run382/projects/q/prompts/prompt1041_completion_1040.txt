  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` value, while this new code fragment resolves it with the `tail` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(error));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` value, while this new code fragment rejects it with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.resolve(error));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the `next` promise with the `head` value, while this new code fragment resolves it with an error.

DONE.
