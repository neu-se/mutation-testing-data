  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, whereas `error` is an Error object. If `Q.onerror` is defined, it would be called with a string instead of an Error object, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `error` is an Error object. If `Q.onerror` is defined, it would be called with a primitive value instead of an Error object, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` is a new Error object, whereas `error` is the original Error object that was thrown. If `Q.onerror` is defined, it would be called with a different Error object, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
