  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a function, so the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a function, so the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a function, so the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
