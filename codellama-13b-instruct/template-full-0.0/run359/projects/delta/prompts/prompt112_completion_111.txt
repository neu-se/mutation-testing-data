  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.insert` property is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.delete` property is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op.retain` property is not defined, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
