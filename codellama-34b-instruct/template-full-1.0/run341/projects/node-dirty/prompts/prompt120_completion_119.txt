  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the condition in the ternary operator always true, causing the 'drain' event to be emitted even if there are still in-flight writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0 && this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there are any in-flight writes and the queue is empty, which would make the condition in the ternary operator always false, causing the 'drain' event to never be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the condition in the ternary operator always false, causing the 'drain' event to never be emitted.

DONE.
