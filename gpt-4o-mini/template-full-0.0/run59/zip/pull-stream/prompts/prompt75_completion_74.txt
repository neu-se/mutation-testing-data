Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to only call the function if `done` is truthy, which could lead to a situation where the callback is not executed when it should be, potentially causing unhandled cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Callback not executed'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces an error to be thrown every time the callback is supposed to be executed, which would disrupt the normal flow of the program and could lead to unhandled exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback to `null` when `done` is falsy, which means that no function will be executed at all, potentially leading to silent failures where expected behavior does not occur.

DONE.
