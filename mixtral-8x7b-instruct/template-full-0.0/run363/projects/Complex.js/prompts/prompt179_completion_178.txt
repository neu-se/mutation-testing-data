 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when d is 0, while the original code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 when d is not 0, while the original code fragment checks if c is 0 before performing any calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value for d, while the original code fragment preserves the sign of d.

DONE.
