  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `options` as the second argument to `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)`, while `options.encoding` would change the encoding of the file being read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `options` as the second argument to `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)`, while `null` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `options` as the second argument to `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)`, while `{ encoding: 'utf8' }` would change the encoding of the file being read to UTF-8.

DONE.
