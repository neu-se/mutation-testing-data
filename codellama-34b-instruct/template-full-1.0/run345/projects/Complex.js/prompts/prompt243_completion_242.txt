  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, since the `re` and `im` properties of the `Complex` object are distinct and can never be equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, since the `re` property of the `Complex` object is never `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, since the `im` property of the `Complex` object is never `0`.

DONE.
