 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reportedUnhandledRejections.length--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of removing the element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of the element at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete reportedUnhandledRejections[atReport]
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the element at the specified index instead of removing it from the array.

DONE.
