  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate.bind(undefined, "allResolved")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deprecate.bind(undefined, "allResolved")` is a function that returns a string, while `deprecate` is a function that returns a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate.bind(undefined, "allSettled")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deprecate.bind(undefined, "allSettled")` is a function that returns a string, while `deprecate` is a function that returns a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate.bind(undefined, "allResolved")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deprecate.bind(undefined, "allResolved")` is a function that returns a string, while `deprecate` is a function that returns a function.

DONE.
