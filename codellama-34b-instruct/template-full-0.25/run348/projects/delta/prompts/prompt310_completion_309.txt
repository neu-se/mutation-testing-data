  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` for all inputs, while the modified code fragment returns `false` for all inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return !predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` for all inputs, while the modified code fragment returns the negation of the `predicate` function for all inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  return iter.next(1).attributes || {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `attributes` property of the next iteration, while the modified code fragment returns an empty object.

DONE.
