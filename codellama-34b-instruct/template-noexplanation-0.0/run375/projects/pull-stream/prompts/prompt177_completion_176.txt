  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || i >= array.length
```
This change will cause the function to return early if the `abort` flag is set, or if the `i` variable is greater than or equal to the length of the `array`. This change is buggy because it will cause the function to return early even if the `i` variable is not yet at the end of the `array`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && i >= array.length
```
This change will cause the function to return early if the `abort` flag is set and the `i` variable is greater than or equal to the length of the `array`. This change is buggy because it will cause the function to return early even if the `abort` flag is not set, which is not the intended behavior.
