Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset => offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code takes the absolute value of the offset before calculating the hours, but this replacement would not, potentially resulting in incorrect hour calculations for negative offsets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor` to calculate the hours, but `Math.ceil` would round up instead of down, potentially resulting in incorrect hour calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.floor` to calculate the hours, but `Math.round` would round to the nearest integer, potentially resulting in incorrect hour calculations for offsets that are not exactly divisible by 60.

DONE.
