  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which would cause the progressed callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, progressed, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which would cause the progressed callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which would cause the progressed callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
