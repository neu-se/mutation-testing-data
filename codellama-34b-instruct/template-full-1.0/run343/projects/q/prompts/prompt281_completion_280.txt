  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arguments` object to be coerced into a number, which would result in the value `1`, regardless of the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arguments` object to be coerced into a string, which would result in the value `"hello"`, regardless of the actual arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arguments` object to be replaced with `null`, regardless of the actual arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
