  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is not defined in the function, and the function would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is a string, and `toUpperCase()` would convert it to uppercase, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is a string, and `split()` would split the string into an array of substrings, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
