Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is used for parsing JSON, whereas the `replacer` function is used for stringifying JSON, so using `reviver` instead of `replacer` would lead to incorrect transformation of the object being stringified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.spaces : null
```
This would result in different behavior because `spaces` is a property that determines the number of spaces to use for indentation, whereas `replacer` is a function that transforms the object being stringified, so using `spaces` instead of `replacer` would lead to incorrect transformation of the object being stringified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? 'defaultReplacer' : null
```
This would result in different behavior because `'defaultReplacer'` is a string, not a function, so when `JSON.stringify` tries to use it as a replacer function, it would lead to incorrect behavior, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
