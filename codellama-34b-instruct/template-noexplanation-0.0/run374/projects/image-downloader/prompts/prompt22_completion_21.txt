  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This change will cause the `dest` path to be resolved relative to the current working directory, rather than the directory containing the module. This could cause the file to be saved in an unexpected location, potentially overwriting existing files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This change will cause the `dest` path to be resolved relative to the parent directory of the current working directory, rather than the directory containing the module. This could cause the file to be saved in an unexpected location, potentially overwriting existing files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This change will cause the `dest` path to be resolved relative to the current working directory, rather than the directory containing the module. This could cause the file to be saved in an unexpected location, potentially overwriting existing files.

DONE.
