  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` and `rejected` are different functions, and the promise will be resolved with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will be rejected with a new error, instead of being resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise will be resolved with `undefined`, instead of being resolved with the original value.

DONE.
