  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start changing the array, and the second is the number of elements to remove. If the second argument is 0, no elements will be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start changing the array, and the second is the number of elements to remove. If the second argument is negative, it will remove elements from the end of the array instead of the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method takes two arguments, the first is the index at which to start changing the array, and the second is the number of elements to remove. If the second argument is the length of the array, it will remove all
