  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the value stored at `key`, rather than the value returned by the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the value stored at `key`, rather than the value returned by the `get` method.
