 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` always returns a resolved promise, while the original `when` function handles both resolved and rejected states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `when` function with an empty function, which would not execute any logic and always return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is an asynchronous function, and the continuation of the code would be delayed, possibly causing unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
