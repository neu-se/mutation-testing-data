  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(λ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the argument, which is not the same as the arctangent of the ratio of the sine and cosine of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(λ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of the argument, which is not the same as the arctangent of the ratio of the sine and cosine of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(λ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument, which is not the same as the arctangent of the ratio of the sine and cosine of the argument.

DONE.
