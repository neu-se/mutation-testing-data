  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 11 instead of 10, which would cause the calculation of the complex number to be off by a factor of 11.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `Math.pow` function would be 1 instead of 0, which would cause the calculation of the complex number to be off by a factor of 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 11 instead of 10, and the second argument of the `Math.pow` function would be 1 instead of 0, which would cause the calculation of the complex number to be off by a factor of 110.
