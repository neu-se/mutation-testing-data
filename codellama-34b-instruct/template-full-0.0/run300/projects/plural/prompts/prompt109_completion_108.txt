  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace the word with itself, while this new code fragment would remove the 's' at the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace the word with itself, while this new code fragment would add an 'es' at the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
