  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the pending count is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the pending count is greater than 0. This would cause the `any` function to reject the promise if there are any pending promises, rather than only rejecting the promise if all promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the pending count is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the pending count is less than 0. This would cause the `any` function to reject the promise if there are any pending promises, rather than only rejecting the promise if all promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the pending count is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if
