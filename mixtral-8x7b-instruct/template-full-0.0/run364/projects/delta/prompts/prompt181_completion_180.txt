 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `otherIter.next()` without passing any arguments, which may not match the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `otherIter.peek()` instead of `otherIter.next()`, which may not advance the iterator and could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of calling the `otherIter.next()` method, which would cause the code to break and not function as intended.

DONE.
