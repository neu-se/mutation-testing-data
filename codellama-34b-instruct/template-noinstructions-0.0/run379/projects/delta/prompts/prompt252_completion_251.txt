  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one operation from the iterator, regardless of the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume the entire length of the current operation, regardless of the actual length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one less operation than the actual length of the current operation.

DONE.
