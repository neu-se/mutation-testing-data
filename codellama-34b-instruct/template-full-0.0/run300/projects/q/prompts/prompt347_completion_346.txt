  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `null` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `function () {}` is also a function, but a different one, so the `typeof` operator would return different values.

DONE.
