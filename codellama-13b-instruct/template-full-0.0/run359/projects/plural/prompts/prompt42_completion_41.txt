  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the first element of the `rules` array instead of the second element. This could potentially cause the code to fail if the first element of the array is not a valid rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing the last element of the `rules` array instead of the second element. This could potentially cause the code to fail if the last element of the array is not a valid rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be accessing a random element of the `rules` array instead of the second element. This could potentially cause the code to fail if the random element is not a valid rule.

DONE.
