  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with `true` instead of `abort`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with the current index `i` instead of `abort`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be invoked with the length of the input array instead of `abort`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
