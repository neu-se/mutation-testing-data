 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include parentheses, so the `inspect` method is not called. Adding parentheses would cause the `inspect` method to be invoked, which could potentially lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `toString` method instead of the `inspect` method. Depending on the implementation of `toString` and `inspect`, this could lead to different output or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.inspect(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `window.inspect` method instead of the method that is directly on the `value` object. If the `value` object does not have an `inspect` method, this would result in an error. If the `window`
