  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator to separate the two expressions, and the result is the value of the second expression `data`. In contrast, using the `+` operator would add `acc` and `data` together and return the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator to separate the two expressions, and the result is the value of the second expression `data`. In contrast, using the `*` operator would multiply `acc` and `data` together and return the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator to separate the two expressions, and the result is the value of the second expression `data`. In contrast, using `null` would return `null`, regardless of the value of `acc` and `data`.

DONE.
