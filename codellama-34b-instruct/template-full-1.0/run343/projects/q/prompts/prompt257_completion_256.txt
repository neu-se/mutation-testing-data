  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that takes a promise as an argument and fulfills the current promise with the value of the resolved promise. However, by replacing `become` with `become(x)`, the promise would be fulfilled with the value of `x` immediately, without waiting for the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that takes a value and returns a rejected promise. By replacing `become` with `become(reject(x))`, the promise would be rejected with the value of `x` immediately, without waiting for the promise to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    become(Q(x));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick
