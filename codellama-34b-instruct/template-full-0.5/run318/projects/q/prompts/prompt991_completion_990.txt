This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, potentially causing the `nodeArgs` variable to be populated with different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, potentially causing the `nodeArgs` variable to be populated with different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, potentially causing the `nodeArgs` variable to be populated with different values.

DONE.
