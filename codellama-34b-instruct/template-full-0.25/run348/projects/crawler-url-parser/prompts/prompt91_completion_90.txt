  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file:` protocol is added to the list of protocols that are checked for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|data:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data:` protocol is added to the list of protocols that are checked for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|about:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `about:` protocol is added to the list of protocols that are checked for.

DONE.
