 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.has` checks if a key exists in the map, but does not return or update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.delete
