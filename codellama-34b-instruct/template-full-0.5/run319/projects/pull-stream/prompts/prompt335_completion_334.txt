  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `data`, which passes the data through the stream unchanged. Replacing it with `null` would cause the stream to pass through `null` instead of the data, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `data`, which passes the data through the stream unchanged. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the stream to pass through `undefined` instead of the data, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `data`, which passes the data through the stream unchanged. Replacing it with `0` would cause the stream to pass through `0` instead of the data, which could cause unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
