  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function, and comparing it to `true` using the `===` operator will always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function, and comparing it to `true` using the `!==` operator will always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function, and calling it will return a boolean value indicating whether the generator has stopped iterating.

DONE.
