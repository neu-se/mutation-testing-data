  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` would turn off the event listener for the `close` event, which would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.on('error', reject)` would add an additional event listener for the `error` event, which would cause the promise to be rejected twice if an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('close', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.on('close', resolve)` would add an additional event listener for the `close` event, which would cause the promise to be resolved twice if the stream is closed.

DONE.
