  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a function that notifies the promise with a progress update, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

DONE.
