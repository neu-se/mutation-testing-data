  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:www\.)?/i
```
This regular expression matches the following patterns:

* `http://` or `https://` followed by an optional `www.`
* `www.` followed by an optional `http://` or `https://`

This will remove the `http://` or `https://` and `www.` from the beginning of the URL, leaving only the domain name and path.

DONE.
