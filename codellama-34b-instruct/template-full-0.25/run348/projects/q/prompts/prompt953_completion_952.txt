  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the result of `fapply`, which is a promise, instead of the original code where `fail` is called on the promise returned by `Q(callback)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is called on the result of `fapply`, which is a promise, instead of the original code where `then` is called on the promise returned by `Q(callback)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is called on the result of `fapply`, which is a promise, instead of the original code where `catch`
