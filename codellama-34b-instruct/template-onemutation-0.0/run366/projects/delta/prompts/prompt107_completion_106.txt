  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
