  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify` instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of notified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify` instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of notified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify` instead of `deferred.notify`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved or rejected.

DONE.
