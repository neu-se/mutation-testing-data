  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` allows reading and writing, while `fs.constants.R_OK` only allows reading.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK) ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow reading but not writing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.X_OK` allows execution, while `fs.constants.R_OK` only allows reading.

DONE.
