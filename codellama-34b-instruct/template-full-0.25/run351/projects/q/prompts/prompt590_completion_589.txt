  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.bind(this)` is a bound function, which means that it has a different `this` context than the original `makeGenerator` function. This could potentially cause issues if the `makeGenerator` function relies on the `this` context to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.call(null)` is a direct call to the `makeGenerator` function, which means that it will not be bound to any particular context. This could potentially cause issues if the `makeGenerator` function relies on the `this` context to function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator.apply(this, arguments)` is a direct call to the `makeGenerator` function, which means
