  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `resetUnhandledRejections` function to be called twice, which could potentially cause issues with the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `unhandledRejections` array, which could potentially cause issues with the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the tracking of unhandled rejections, which could potentially cause issues with the detection of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
