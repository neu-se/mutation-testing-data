  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a reference to the variable `value`, while `_value + 1` is an arithmetic expression that adds 1 to the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a reference to the variable `value`, while `value + 1` is an arithmetic expression that adds 1 to the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a reference to the variable `value`, while `_value - 1` is an arithmetic expression that subtracts 1 from the value of `value`.

DONE.
