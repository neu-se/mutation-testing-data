  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is a different function than `filter`, and it would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `filterNot` function with the `data` argument, which would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(data, test)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `filterNot` function with the `data` and `test` arguments, which would change the behavior of the `filterNot` function.

DONE.
