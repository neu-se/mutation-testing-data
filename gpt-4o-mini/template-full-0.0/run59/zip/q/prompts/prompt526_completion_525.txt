Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not receive any arguments, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `args` would cause the function to treat it as an object, which could lead to runtime errors when attempting to access properties or methods that do not exist on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array would change the expected arguments to the dispatched operation, which may lead to incorrect handling of the operation if it expects specific arguments to be present.

DONE.
