  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not the same as the `b` variable used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression is not the same as the `b` variable used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs(b)` expression is not the same as the `b` variable used in the original code.

DONE.
