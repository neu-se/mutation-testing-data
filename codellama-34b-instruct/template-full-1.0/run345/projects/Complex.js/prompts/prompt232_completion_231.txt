  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` is the cube root function, while `Math.sqrt` is the square root function. Using `Math.cbrt` instead would cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the cosine function, while `Math.sqrt` is the square root function. Using `Math.cos` instead would cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number. Using `Math.random` instead would cause the function to return a different result each time it is
