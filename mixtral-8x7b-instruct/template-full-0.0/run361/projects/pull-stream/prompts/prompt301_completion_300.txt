 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets `ended` to a truthy value, even if `end` is a falsy value. The original code fragment `ended = end` assigns the value of `end` to `ended`, whereas this mutation always assigns a truthy value, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `global` object to set the value of `ended`, potentially affecting other parts of the code that might be using the same variable name. The original code fragment `ended = end` assigns the value of `end` to a local variable `ended`, whereas this mutation uses the `global` object, causing unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended += end
