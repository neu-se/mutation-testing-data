  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `cb` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks whether it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes `cb` as an argument to the `terminate` function, while the new code fragment calls `cb` as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `cb` as an argument to the `terminate` function, while the new code fragment passes a function that returns `cb` as an argument to the `terminate` function.

DONE.
