  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `rest` returns the remaining elements of the array as a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.filter(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `rest` returns the remaining elements of the array as a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest.filter(op => op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `rest` returns the remaining elements of the array as a new array.

DONE.
