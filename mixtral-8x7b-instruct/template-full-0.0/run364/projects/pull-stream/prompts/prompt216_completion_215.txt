 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the data as the error instead of the actual error object. This could cause issues downstream if the error handling code expects an Error object with a `message` and `stack` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore any errors that occur during the map operation. This could cause issues if the downstream code relies on the error being propagated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Artificial error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always create a new Error object with the message 'Artificial error', even if there was no actual error. This could cause issues if the downstream code relies on the error being the actual error that occurred.

DONE.
