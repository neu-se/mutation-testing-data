  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` event is not the same as the `error` event. The `data` event is emitted when there is new data available to read, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is not the same as the `error` event. The `close` event is emitted when the stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_close` event is not the same as the `error` event. The `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error.

DONE.
