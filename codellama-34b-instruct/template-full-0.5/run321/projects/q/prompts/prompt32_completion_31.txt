  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so it would not execute the `task` function passed to it, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not a function, so it would not execute the `task` function passed to it, which would cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an error to be thrown, which would cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
