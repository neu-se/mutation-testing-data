Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var object_toString = Function.prototype.call;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the implementation of `object_toString` to use `Function.prototype.call`, which does not provide the same functionality as `Object.prototype.toString`, leading to incorrect type checking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var object_toString = Object.prototype.valueOf;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` returns the primitive value of the specified object, which is not equivalent to the string representation of the object, thus breaking the intended type identification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var object_toString = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the `hasOwnProperty` method to `object_toString`, which would cause any calls to `object_toString` to check for property ownership instead of returning the object's string representation, leading to incorrect results in type checks.

DONE.
