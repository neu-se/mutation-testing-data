  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is always truthy, which would cause the function to return the opposite of what it's supposed to return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` would invert the result of `test`, which would cause the function to return the same result as it does currently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a function that takes a `data` parameter, which would cause the function to return the result of the `filter` function instead of the result of `test`.

DONE.
