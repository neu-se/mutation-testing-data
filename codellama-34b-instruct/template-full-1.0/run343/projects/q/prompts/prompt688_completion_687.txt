  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately rather than in a future turn, potentially causing the application to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise immediately rather than in a future turn, potentially causing the application to break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a notification with a specific index and progress value, potentially causing the application to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
