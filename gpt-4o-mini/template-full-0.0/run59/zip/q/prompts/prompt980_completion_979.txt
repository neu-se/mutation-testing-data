Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would immediately resolve the promise without waiting for the Node-style callback, potentially leading to incorrect handling of asynchronous results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("An error occurred"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject(new Error("An error occurred"))` would immediately reject the promise with a specific error, bypassing the intended callback mechanism and causing the promise to fail regardless of the actual operation's success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` would mean that no callback is provided to handle the result of the asynchronous operation, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections or unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
