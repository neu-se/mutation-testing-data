  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns a `RegExpMatchArray` object, which is an array-like object that contains information about the match. By comparing the result of the `match` method to `null`, we can determine if the string matches the regular expression or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns a `RegExpMatchArray` object, which is an array-like object that contains information about the match. By comparing the result of the `match` method to `null`, we can determine if the string matches the regular expression or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `RegExpMatchArray` object contains the number of matches found
