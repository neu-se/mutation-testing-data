  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is an error object, while `null` is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is an error object, while `new Error('abort')` is a new error object with the message 'abort'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is an error object, while `abort.message` is the message property of the error object.

DONE.
