  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called, and the fulfillment value is not passed to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(promise, function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `Q` function, not on the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, not on the `Q` function.

DONE.
