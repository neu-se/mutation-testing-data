  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would be called on the read stream without any error object, which could cause the stream to close without properly reading the data from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would be called on the write stream without any data, which could cause the stream to close without properly writing the data to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be written to the file, which could cause the stream to fail to write any data to the file.

DONE.
