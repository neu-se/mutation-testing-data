  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to always return `b`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. This is a buggy behavior, as the function is expected to return a new object that is the composition of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to always return the sum of `a` and `b`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. This is a buggy behavior, as the function is expected to return a new object that is the composition of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This change will cause the `compose` function to always return the product of `a` and `b`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. This is a buggy behavior, as the function is expected to return a new object that is the composition of
