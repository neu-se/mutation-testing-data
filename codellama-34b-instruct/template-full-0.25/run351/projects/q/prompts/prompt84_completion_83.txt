  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that schedules the `flush` function to be called on the next tick of the event loop. Calling `requestTick()` immediately would cause `flush` to be called immediately, rather than on the next tick of the event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, rather than on the next tick of the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules the `flush` function to be called on the next tick of the event loop, but with higher priority than `requestTick`.

DONE.
