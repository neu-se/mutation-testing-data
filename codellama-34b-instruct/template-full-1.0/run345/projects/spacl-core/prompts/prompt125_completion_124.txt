  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if `count` is less than 0, which is the opposite of the `>` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks if `count` is equal to 0, while the `>` operator checks if `count` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator checks if `count` is less than or equal to 0, which is a different condition than checking if `count` is greater than 0.

DONE.
