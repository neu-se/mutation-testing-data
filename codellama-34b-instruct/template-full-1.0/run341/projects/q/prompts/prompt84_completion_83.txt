  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the call to `requestTick` to fail, as `undefined` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `requestTick` to be called twice instead of once, potentially leading to a race condition or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('test'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown when `requestTick` is called, which could be handled differently than the original code.

DONE.
