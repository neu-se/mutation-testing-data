  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "foo" to the value of `src`, which would change the path that is being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `src`, which would change the path that is being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace('src', 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string "src" with "foo" in the value of `src`, which would change the path that is being accessed.

DONE.
