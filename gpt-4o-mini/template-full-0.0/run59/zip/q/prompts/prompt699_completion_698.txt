Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore all arguments passed to the function, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to call the promised function with any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments, potentially causing the function to be called with missing or incorrect parameters, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use a negative index, which is not valid in this context, leading to an empty array being passed to the dispatch method, thus failing to call the function with the intended arguments.

DONE.
