  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is not undefined and if it contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is not undefined and if it does not contain illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is not undefined and if it contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is not undefined and if it contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!baseUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `baseUrlStr` is not undefined and if it
