  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid call to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment is not a valid call to any method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to the `dispatch` method with the `apply` method name and an array of arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a call to the `dispatch` method with the `apply` method name and an array of arguments that includes the `void 0` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args], function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a call to the `dispatch` method with the `apply` method name and an array
