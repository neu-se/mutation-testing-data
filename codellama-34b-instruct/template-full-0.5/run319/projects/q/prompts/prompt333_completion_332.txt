  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `1` to the result, which could change the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would double the result, which could change the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract `1` from the result, which could change the program's behavior.

DONE.
