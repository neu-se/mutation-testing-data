  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, function (end, data) {
  if(!end) op && op(data)
  else once(end)
  cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the first argument to `cb()`, regardless of whether `end` is true or false. In the original code, the first argument to `cb()` is determined by the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(end, function (end, data) {
  if(!end) op && op(data)
  else once(end)
  cb(end, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes the `end` value as the first argument to `cb()`, regardless of whether `end` is true or false. In the original code, the first argument to `cb()` is determined by whether `end` is true or false.
