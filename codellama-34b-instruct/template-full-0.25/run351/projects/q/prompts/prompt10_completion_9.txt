  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a syntax error due to the missing parentheses and argument list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define an anonymous function but not call it, resulting in no side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
define(function() { return 42; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define an anonymous function that returns the value 42, but it would not be called, resulting in no side effects.

DONE.
