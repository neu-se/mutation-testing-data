  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to iterate one less time, potentially missing some needed operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the current one, causing the loop to terminate earlier or later than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekElement()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the element of the other iterator instead of the current one, causing the loop to terminate earlier or later than expected.

DONE.
