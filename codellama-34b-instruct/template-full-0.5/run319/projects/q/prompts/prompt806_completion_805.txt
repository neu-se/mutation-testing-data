  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would change the value of `this` inside the callback function, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would change the value of `this` inside the callback function to `null`, which may not be intended.

DONE.
