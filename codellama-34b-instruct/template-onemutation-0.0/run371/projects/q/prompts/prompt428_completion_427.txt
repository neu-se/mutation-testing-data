  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would throw an error, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false` if `object` does not have a `state` property or if its value is not `"rejected"`.
