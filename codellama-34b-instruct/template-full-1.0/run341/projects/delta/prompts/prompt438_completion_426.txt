  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeofnextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated code fragment will consider a retain operation that stores an object to be different from a retain operation that stores a number, whereas the original code fragment only considers retain operations that store a number to be valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain ! == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated code fragment will consider a retain operation that stores any value other than undefined to be valid, whereas the original code fragment only considers retain operations that store a number to be valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the updated code fragment will consider a retain operation that stores a function to be different from a retain operation that stores a number, whereas the original code fragment only considers retain operations that store a number to be valid.
