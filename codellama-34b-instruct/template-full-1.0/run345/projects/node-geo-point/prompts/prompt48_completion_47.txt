  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional 180 degrees would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 360 degrees would cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
