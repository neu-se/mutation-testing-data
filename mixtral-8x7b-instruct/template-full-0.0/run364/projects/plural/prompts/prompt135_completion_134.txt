 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'this'
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the string being operated on, rather than the word being tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the first rule's pattern, regardless of the actual word being tested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `plural` function itself, rather than applying the function to the word being tested.

DONE.
