  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, and it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, and it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, and it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
