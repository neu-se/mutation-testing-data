  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Delta object, while this option returns the result of the chop() method, which mutates the existing Delta object and returns a reference to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Delta object, while this option returns the result of the concat() method, which returns a new Delta object that is the concatenation of the original Delta object and a new empty Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.diff(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new Delta object, while this option returns the result of the diff() method, which returns a new Delta object that represents the difference between the original Delta object and a new empty Delta object.
