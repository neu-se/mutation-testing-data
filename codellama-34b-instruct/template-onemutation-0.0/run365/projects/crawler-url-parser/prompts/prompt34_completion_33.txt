  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the parser to not interpret the first segment of the URL as a hostname, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs with a protocol-relative URL.
