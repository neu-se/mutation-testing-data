  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if the callback is undefined, but this modified code fragment would throw an error in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not resolve the promise with the callback function, but this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not notify the promise with the callback function, but this modified code fragment would notify the promise with the callback function.

DONE.
