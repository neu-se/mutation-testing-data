Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/index.html');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the replacement string from a simple '/' to '/index.html', which would not match the original intent of normalizing paths that end with 'index' files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the handling of 'index' files entirely, which means that any path ending with 'default' would still be processed, potentially leading to incorrect path normalization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/default');
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces 'index' files with 'default', which changes the semantics of the URL structure and could lead to incorrect URL resolution in the context of the application.

DONE.
