  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property is not a valid identifier for the `data` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` would be evaluated as a truthy value, and the `id` property would be overwritten with a new value of `1`, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` property would be incremented by `1`, resulting in a different country being selected.

DONE
