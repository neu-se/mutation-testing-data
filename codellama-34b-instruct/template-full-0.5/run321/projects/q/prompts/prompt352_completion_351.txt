  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a callback function that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `rejected` is a callback function that is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (exception) { return reject(exception); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with the `exception` argument, which is the rejection reason. In contrast, the `fulfilled` function is called with the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is called with the resolved value, whereas the `rejected` function is called with the rejection reason.

DONE.
