  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is a number but `nextOp.delete` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.delete` is a number, while this replacement checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is a string but `nextOp.delete` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
