  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `result` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior depending on the type of the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method is called on the `result` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior depending on the type of the `result` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toJSON()` method is called on the `result` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior depending on the type of the `result` object.

DONE.
