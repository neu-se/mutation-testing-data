Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a single character (the number 1) into the `line` Delta instead of the actual content of the operation, potentially altering the output of the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to push an empty operation into the `line` Delta, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when processing the lines, as it effectively does nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the attributes of the next operation instead of the operation itself, which could lead to a Delta that contains only attributes and no actual content, thus changing the intended functionality of the `eachLine` method.

DONE.
