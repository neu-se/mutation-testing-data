  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This change will cause the `round` method to always round up to the nearest integer, rather than rounding to the nearest integer or down to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || -1
```
This change will cause the `round` method to always round down to the nearest integer, rather than rounding to the nearest integer or down to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || Math.random()
```
This change will cause the `round` method to randomly round up or down to the nearest integer, rather than rounding to the nearest integer or down to zero.

DONE.
