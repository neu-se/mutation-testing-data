  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest().slice(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.rest` calls the `rest()` method, but `.rest().slice(this.index)` calls the `slice()` method on the result of the `rest()` method, which would return a new slice of the array that starts from the `this.index` position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest().slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.rest` calls the `rest()` method, but `.rest().slice(1)` calls the `slice()` method on the result of the `rest()` method, which would return a new slice of the array that starts from the second position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest().splice(this.index, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.rest` calls the `rest()` method, but `.rest().splice(this.index, 1)` calls the `splice
