  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which changes the logic of the statement. With `||`, if either `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` or `base[key]` is undefined, the statement will evaluate to true, whereas with `&&`, both conditions must be true for the statement to evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of the `===` operator, which changes the logic of the statement. With `!==`, if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and `base[key]` is not undefined, the statement will evaluate to true, whereas with `===` both conditions must be true for the statement to evaluate to true.
