  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a string and would cause the `buildTimezone()` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid timezone name and would cause the `buildTimezone()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because "invalid_timezone" is not a valid timezone name and would cause the `buildTimezone()` function to throw an error.

DONE.
