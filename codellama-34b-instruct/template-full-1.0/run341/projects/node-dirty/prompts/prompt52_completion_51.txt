  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
foo.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo.bar` is not defined in the code, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bar.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `bar.foo` is not defined in the code, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid key, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
