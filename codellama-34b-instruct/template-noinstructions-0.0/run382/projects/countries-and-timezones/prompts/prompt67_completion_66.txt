  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object with the `options` object merged into it, whereas the original code fragment would return the country object without the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object without the `options` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the country object with the `options` object merged into it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `options` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the country object with the `options` object merged into it.

DONE.
