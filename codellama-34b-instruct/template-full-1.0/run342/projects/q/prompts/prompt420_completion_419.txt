  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 !value;
```
This would result in different behavior because !value is always falsy, whereas value could be either truthy or falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 value && value;
```
This would result in different behavior because value && value evaluates to a truthy value if value is truthy, and a falsy value if value is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 value ? value : !value;
```
This would result in different behavior because value ? value : !value evaluates to value if value is truthy, and !value if value is falsy.

DONE.
