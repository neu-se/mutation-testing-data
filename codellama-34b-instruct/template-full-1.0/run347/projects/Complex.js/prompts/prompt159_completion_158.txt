  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in the code incorrectly returning Complex['NAN'] when the denominator is zero, as the check for zero is performed on the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c['isZero']()
```
This would result in the code incorrectly returning Complex['INFINITY'] when the denominator is zero, as the check for zero is performed on the wrong variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d['isZero']()
```
This would result in the code incorrectly returning Complex['ZERO'] when the denominator is zero, as the check for zero is performed on the wrong variable.

DONE.
