  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Option 1:  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
function (value) {
  if (resolve) {
  resolve(value);
   }
}

This would result in different behavior because the code would defer the promise, potentially forever, causing a memory leak. It would also bypass the promise's error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
reject(value);

This would result in different behavior because the code would reject the promise, preventing further progress, whereas the original code fragment resolves the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
resolve();

This would result in different behavior because the code would resolve the promise without a value, whereas the original code fragment resolves the promise with a value.

DONE.
