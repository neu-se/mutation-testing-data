  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"NaN"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string, while the original code returns a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different number, while the original code would return the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string, while the original code returns a number or undefined.

DONE.
