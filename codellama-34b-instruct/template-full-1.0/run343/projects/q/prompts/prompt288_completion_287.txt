  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Custom error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message would be thrown instead of the default `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Custom error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message would be thrown instead of the default `notify` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(new Error("Custom error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message would be thrown instead of the default `makeNodeResolver` method.

DONE.
