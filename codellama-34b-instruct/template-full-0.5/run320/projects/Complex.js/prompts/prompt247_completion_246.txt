  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, which would change the resulting value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would change the resulting value.

DONE.
