  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a function that takes a single argument, whereas `nfapply` takes an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because `npost` is a function that takes a method name and an array of arguments, whereas `nfapply` takes a function and an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfbind` is a function that takes a function and returns a bound function that takes the same arguments as the original function, whereas `nfapply` takes a function and an array of arguments.

DONE.
