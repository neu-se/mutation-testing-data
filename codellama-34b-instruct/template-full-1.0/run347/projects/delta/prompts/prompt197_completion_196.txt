  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = newDelta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new value to the `insert` property of `newOp`, but the original code did not do that.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newOp = thisOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new value to `newOp`, but the original code did not do that.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newOp = otherOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new value to `newOp`, but the original code did not do that.

DONE.
