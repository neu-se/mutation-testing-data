  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would advance the iterator to the next element, whereas `otherIter.peek()` would only return the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` would return the next element without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` would advance the iterator to the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(1)` would return the next element without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` would advance the iterator to the next element.

DONE.
