  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method would reject the promise with a `TypeError` when `null` is encountered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method would reject the promise with a `TypeError` when `undefined` is encountered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` method would reject the promise with a `TypeError` when `NaN` is encountered.

Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are all correct. DONE.
