  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `sin` performs a sine calculation instead of a logarithmic one, so the output of the function would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 1, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the operator `'+'`, so the function would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
