  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and the first element of the array would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, and the last element of the array would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at an index that is outside the bounds of the array, and an error would be thrown.

DONE.
