  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"previous"
```
This would result in different behavior because "previous" is not a valid verb for a generator, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because "yield" is a reserved word in JavaScript and cannot be used as a verb for a generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a reserved word in JavaScript and cannot be used as a verb for a generator.

DONE.
