  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first progress listener, while the original code calls all progress listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all progress listeners except the first one, while the original code calls all progress listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.filter(function(listener) { return listener !== progressListener; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all progress listeners except the one that was passed as an argument, while the original code calls all progress listeners.

DONE.
