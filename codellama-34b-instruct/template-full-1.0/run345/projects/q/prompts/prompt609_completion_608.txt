  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specified reason, whereas `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a specified value. Using `deferred.reject` instead of `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the rest of the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, args, op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed to `deferred.reject` as the reason for rejection, rather than as the promise value. This could cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than intended, which could have downstream effects on the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is
