  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would cause the first element of the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, which would cause an error if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, which would cause the last element of the array to be skipped.

DONE.
