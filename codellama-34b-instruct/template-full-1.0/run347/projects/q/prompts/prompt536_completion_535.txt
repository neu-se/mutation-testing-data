  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()`
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator would stop executing immediately and return a rejected promise, whereas the original code would continue executing the generator and return a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify()`
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator would skip the current iteration and move on to the next one, whereas the original code would continue executing the current iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled()`
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise from the generator would be resolved with a different value (a promise) than the original promise, which was resolved with a raw value.

DONE.
