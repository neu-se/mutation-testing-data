 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because, even if the `aborted` flag is set, it would still call the callback with the data, which is not the same as the original behavior that just calls the callback with the `aborted` error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately terminate the process, not giving the rest of the code a chance to execute and handle the error properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, function (err, data) {
  busy = false;
  cb(err, data);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `busy` to false before calling the callback, which could cause issues if there are other parts of the code that rely on `busy` being true at that point in time.

DONE.
