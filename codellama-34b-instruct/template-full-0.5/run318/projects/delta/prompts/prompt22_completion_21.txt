  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is the strict inequality operator, which checks for both value and type equality, whereas `isEqual` is a function that checks for value equality only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` is the negation of the `isEqual` function, which means that it will return `true` if the values are not equal, and `false` if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual(a, b)` is the negation of the `isEqual` function called with the arguments `a` and `b`, which means that it will return `true` if the values are not equal, and `false` if they are equal.

DONE.
