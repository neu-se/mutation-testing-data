  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start at the last character of the string, instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start at the second-to-last character of the string, instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - w.indexOf(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start at the index of the last occurence of the string `'<PLACEHOLDER>'`, instead of the first.

DONE.
