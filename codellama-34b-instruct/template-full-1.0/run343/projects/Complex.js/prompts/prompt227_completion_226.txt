  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `0` returns the value `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `1` returns the value `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` returns the value of `a`, while the new code fragment `a + 1` returns the value of `a + 1`.

DONE.
