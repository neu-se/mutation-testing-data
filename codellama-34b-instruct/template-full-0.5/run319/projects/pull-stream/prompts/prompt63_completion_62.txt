  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would always be set to `abort`, regardless of the value of `end` or `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would be set to the opposite of `abort`, regardless of the value of `end` or `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` would always be set to `null`, regardless of the value of `end` or `abort`.

DONE.
