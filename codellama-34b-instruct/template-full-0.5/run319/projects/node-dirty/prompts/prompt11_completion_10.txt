  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would always create a new empty array for the `key` value, rather than returning the existing array if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key) || []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the existing array for the `key` value if it exists, or an empty array if it doesn't.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.has(key) ? this._queue.get(key) : []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `has` method would check if the `key` value exists in the queue, and if it does, it would return the existing array for that key. If it doesn't, it would return an empty array.

DONE.
