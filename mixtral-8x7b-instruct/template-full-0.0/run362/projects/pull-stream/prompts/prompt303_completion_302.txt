 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would always be set to false, even when the input data causes the function to end. This could cause the function to continue reading data even after it should have stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `ended` variable from the global scope, rather than the local scope of the function. This could cause unexpected behavior if there is another variable with the same name in the global scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `ended` property of the current object, rather than the local variable. This could cause unexpected behavior if the object does not have an `ended` property or if the property has a different value than the local variable.

DONE.
