  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "wrong name"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a different argument, which could cause it to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a null argument, which could cause it to return a null timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a different argument, which could cause it to return a different timezone object.

DONE.
