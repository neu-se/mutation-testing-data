  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the code to execute the `cb(aborted)` line even if `aborted` is not true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `aborted` and `err` are true, and if so, executes the `cb(aborted)` line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `aborted` or `err` is true, and if so, executes the `cb(aborted)` line.

DONE.
