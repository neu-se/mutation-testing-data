 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the raw `arguments` object instead of an array slice, which may cause unexpected results if the callee is not designed to handle the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, 123]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes the integer `123` as the second argument, regardless of the original arguments, which will likely cause incorrect behavior in the callee.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"anotherMethod", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a nonexistent method `anotherMethod` instead of `post`, which would cause a `TypeError` when the method is not found.

DONE.
