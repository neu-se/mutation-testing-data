Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter from a newline character to a comma, which would incorrectly parse the data if the rows are separated by newlines, leading to potential data corruption or loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter to a space, which is not appropriate for separating JSON objects that are expected to be on separate lines, potentially causing the entire parsing logic to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the buffer into individual characters and then reverses the order, which would completely disrupt the intended parsing of the JSON rows, likely resulting in errors during JSON parsing.

DONE.
