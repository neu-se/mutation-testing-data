  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a property of the URL object that returns the hostname of the URL, without the port number. In contrast, `host` returns the hostname and the port number, if present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol == linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `protocol` is a property of the URL object that returns the protocol of the URL, such as "http" or "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname == linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is a property of the URL object that returns the pathname of the URL, without the query string or the fragment identifier.

DONE.
