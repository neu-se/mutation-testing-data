  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` block to execute when the iterator is pointing to a delete operation, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` block to execute when the iterator is pointing to a retain operation, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert' && iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` block to execute when the iterator is pointing to an insert operation with a length greater than 0, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
