  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === null || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match if the property is null, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the property is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match if the property is undefined, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the property is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === null || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match if the property is null or undefined, whereas the original code fragment would only match if the property is not undefined.

DONE.
