 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"rejectionHandled", "some random string", promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the unhandled reason with a static string, which would cause the process to emit the wrong information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[Math.floor(Math.random() * unhandledReasons.length)], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects a random unhandled reason instead of using the correct one, which would cause confusion in tracking unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], Q.reject("another reason")
