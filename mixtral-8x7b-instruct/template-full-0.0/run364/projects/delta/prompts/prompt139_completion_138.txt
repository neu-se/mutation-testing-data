 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to check for 'delete' operations instead of 'insert' operations, potentially skipping or processing incorrect operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a type error, as '1' is not a function or property. This would cause the code to fail at runtime, revealing a potential issue with the type checking in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `peekType` method, potentially causing the code to behave differently if the method has side effects. This could reveal issues with the code's reliance on method calls and their potential side effects.

DONE.
