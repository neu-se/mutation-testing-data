 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('dummy data')
```
This would result in different behavior because it writes 'dummy data' to the file instead of corking the writable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it destroys the writable stream immediately, without waiting for any data to be written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(); this._writeStream.uncork()
```
This would result in different behavior because it corks and then uncorks the writable stream, effectively disabling the buffering behavior provided by the `cork` method.

DONE.
