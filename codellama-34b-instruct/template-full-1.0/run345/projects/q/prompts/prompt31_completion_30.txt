  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last item from the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first item from the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which removes the last item from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method removes and replaces items from the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `laterQueue.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which only removes items from the array.

DONE.
