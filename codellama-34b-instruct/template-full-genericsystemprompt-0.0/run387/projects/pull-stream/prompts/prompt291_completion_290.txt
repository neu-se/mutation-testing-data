  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, regardless of whether the item is unique or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique(field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the opposite of what it should, i.e. it would return `true` for unique items and `false` for non-unique items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique(field, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `true`, regardless of whether the item is unique or not.

DONE.
