  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` mutates the original array by removing the first element, whereas `push()` only adds a new element to the end of the array without modifying its existing contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.unshift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds a new element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push()` only adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.concat([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new array with the elements of both arrays concatenated, whereas `push()` only adds a new element to the end of the array.

DONE.
