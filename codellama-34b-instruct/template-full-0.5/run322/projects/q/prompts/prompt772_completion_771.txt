  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.map(function (promise) {
    return promise.then(null, function (err) {
        return err;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `all` to wait for all promises to be resolved, while this code uses `map` to create a new array of promises that are resolved with the rejection reason if the original promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.map(function (promise) {
    return promise.then(function (value) {
        return value;
    }, function (err) {
        throw err;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `all` to wait for all promises to be resolved, while this code uses `map` to create a new array of promises that are resolved with the value if the original promise is fulfilled, or rejected with the rejection reason if the original promise is rejected.

Option 3: The
