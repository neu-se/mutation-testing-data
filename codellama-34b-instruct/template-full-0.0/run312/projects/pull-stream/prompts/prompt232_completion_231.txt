  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been removed, which would cause the `end` variable to be evaluated as true instead of false, and the `test(data)` function to be called even if `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has been used instead of `&&`, which would cause the `test(data)` function to be called if `end` is false or if `test(data)` returns true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been added to the `test(data)` function, which would cause the function to be called with the opposite result as the original code.

DONE.
