  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is only calling `cb` with `null` and `ended` as arguments, while this code is also passing `data` as an extra argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is only calling `cb` with `null` and `ended` as arguments, while this code is passing `null` and `null` as arguments, essentially resetting the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is only calling `cb` with `null` and `ended` as arguments, while this code is only passing `ended` as an argument, potentially causing a different callback to be triggered.

DONE.
