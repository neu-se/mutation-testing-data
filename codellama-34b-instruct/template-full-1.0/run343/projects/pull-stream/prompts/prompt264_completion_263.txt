  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `err` parameter in the `nextChunk()` function, whereas `null` is. In the original code, `null` is used to indicate that there is no error, whereas `undefined` is used to indicate that the `err` parameter has not been set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a valid value for the `err` parameter in the `nextChunk()` function, whereas `null` is not. In the original code, `null` is used to indicate that there is no error, whereas `false` is used to indicate that the `err` parameter has been set but there is no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value for the `err` parameter in the `nextChunk()` function,
