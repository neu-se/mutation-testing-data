  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isPromise` function, so a promise would be considered a fulfilled value instead of a pending promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if an object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method but may not be a true promise. This would cause the `then` method to be called on a non-promise object, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function checks if a promise is fulfilled, but it would also return `true` for a non-promise value. This would cause the `then` method to be called on a non-promise value,
