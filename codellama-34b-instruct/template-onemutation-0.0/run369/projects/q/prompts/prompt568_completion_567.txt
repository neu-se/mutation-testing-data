  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the error handling code to be executed, which could result in different behavior.
