  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr.length` would return the length of the `baseUrlStr` string, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.indexOf("http")
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr.indexOf("http")` would return the index of the first occurrence of the string "http" in `baseUrlStr`, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.lastIndexOf("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr.lastIndexOf("/")` would return the index of the last occurrence of the character "/" in `baseUrlStr`, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different value.

DONE.
