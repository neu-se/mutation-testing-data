  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment is calling it with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to `abortCb` is different. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with the arguments in the correct order, but this new code fragment is calling it with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument is missing. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with all three arguments, but this new
