  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error object as an argument, while the mutated code would call it with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error object as an argument, while the mutated code would call it with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` function to be called with an error object as an argument, while the mutated code would call it with a new error object.

DONE.
