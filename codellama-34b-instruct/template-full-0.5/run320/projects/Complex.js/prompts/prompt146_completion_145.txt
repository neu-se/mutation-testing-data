  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of multiplying them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of adding them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the imaginary part of the complex number by the real part instead of the real part by the imaginary part.

DONE.
