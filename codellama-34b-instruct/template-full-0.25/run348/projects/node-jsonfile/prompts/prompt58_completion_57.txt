  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the EOL constant, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses a space character. This would cause the output of the stringify function to be different, as the newline character would be replaced with a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the EOL constant, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses null. This would cause the output of the stringify function to be different, as the newline character would be replaced with null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the EOL constant, which is a newline character, while the new code fragment uses undefined. This would cause the output of the stringify function to be different, as the newline character would be replaced with undefined.

DONE.
