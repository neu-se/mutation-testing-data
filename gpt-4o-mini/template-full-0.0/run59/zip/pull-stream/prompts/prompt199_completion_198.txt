Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `abort` would cause the callback to be invoked with `null`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort scenario, as the original intent was to signal an abort condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a new error object instead of the `abort` value would change the type of the response, which could lead to the consumer of the callback treating it as an error rather than an abort signal, thus altering the flow of error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` would mean that the callback is invoked without any argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the callback function, as it would not receive the expected abort signal, potentially causing the program to continue processing when it should not.

DONE.
