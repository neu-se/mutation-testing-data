Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0' ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/ : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the checks for malformed wildcards that were present in the original code, potentially allowing invalid wildcard patterns to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only check for malformed captures, ignoring the checks for malformed wildcards entirely, which could lead to incorrect path specifications being accepted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic, allowing paths that contain malformed captures to be accepted, which contradicts the original intent of validating the path specification.

DONE.
