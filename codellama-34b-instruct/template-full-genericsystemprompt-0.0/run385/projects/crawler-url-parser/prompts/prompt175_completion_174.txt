  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `parse` function is an options object, and passing an empty object would cause the function to use default options, which may not be the same as the options used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, {baseUrl: 'https://example.com'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` option is set to a different value than the original code, which may cause the function to parse the URL differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, {baseUrl: 'https://example.com', query: {foo: 'bar'}})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` option is set to a different value than the original code, which may cause the function to parse the URL differently.

DONE.
