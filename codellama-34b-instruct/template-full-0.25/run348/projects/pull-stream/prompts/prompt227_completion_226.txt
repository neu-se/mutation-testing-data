  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the boolean value of `test`. If `test` is `true`, then `!test` would be `false`, and if `test` is `false`, then `!test` would be `true`. This would cause the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the `filterNot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is a mathematical addition, which would add 1 to the value of `test`. If `test` is a boolean value, then this would cause an error because booleans cannot be added to numbers. If `test` is a number, then this would cause the `filter` function to return a different value than it should, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the `filterNot` function.

Option 3: The PL
