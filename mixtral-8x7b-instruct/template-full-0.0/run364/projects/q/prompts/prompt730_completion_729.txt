 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method expects an object with `index` and `value` properties, but it is being passed `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
