  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` return the rounded value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the rounded value, whereas `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` return the rounded value with different rounding behavior for negative numbers.

DONE.
