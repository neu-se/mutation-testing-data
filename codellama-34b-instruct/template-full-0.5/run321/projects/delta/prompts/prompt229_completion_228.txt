  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to go one step further than the original code, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to go one step back than the original code, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to go twice as far as the original code, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
