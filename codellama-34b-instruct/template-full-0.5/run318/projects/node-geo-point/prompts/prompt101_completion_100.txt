  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the initial latitude, while `φ2` is the final latitude after the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the initial longitude, while `λ2` is the final longitude after the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the initial latitude, while `cosφ2` is the cosine of the final latitude after the calculation.

DONE.
