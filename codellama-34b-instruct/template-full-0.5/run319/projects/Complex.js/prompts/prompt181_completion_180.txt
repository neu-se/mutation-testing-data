  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, rather than checking if the number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is zero, rather than checking if the number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is zero, rather than checking if the number is zero.

DONE.
