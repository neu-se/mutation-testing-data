 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function would return `null` instead of the original promise value, potentially causing issues in the rest of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function would return an empty object instead of the original promise value, potentially causing issues in the rest of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function would return a new resolved promise instead of the original promise value, potentially causing issues in the rest of the promise chain.

DONE.
