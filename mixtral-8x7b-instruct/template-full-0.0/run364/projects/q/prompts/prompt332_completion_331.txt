 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value is passed to the `reject` method instead of the `resolve` method, causing the promise to be rejected with the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_fulfilled` function call is skipped, causing the promise to be resolved directly with the raw value instead of applying the `fulfilled` function to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original value is replaced with a constant value (42), causing the promise to be resolved with that constant value instead of the actual value it was supposed to be resolved with.

DONE.
