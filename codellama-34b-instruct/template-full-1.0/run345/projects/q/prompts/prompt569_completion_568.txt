  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback function would not be called with an error if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback function would not be called with an error if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback function would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

DONE.
