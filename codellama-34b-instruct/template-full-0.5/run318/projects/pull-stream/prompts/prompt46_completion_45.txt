  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the beginning instead of the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element instead of the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute because the condition `i < length` would always be false.

DONE.
