  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has ended or not, and it is not equivalent to `!end`, which is a negation of the `end` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a boolean value that indicates whether the stream has been aborted or not, and it is not equivalent to `!end`, which is a negation of the `end` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a function that is called with the `data` argument, and it is not equivalent to `!end`, which is a negation of the `end` value.

DONE.
