  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` property is checked in a negated manner, which would cause the code to execute a different path than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` property is checked in a different manner, which would cause the code to execute a different path than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && !z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is checked in a different manner, which would cause the code to execute a different path than the original code.

DONE.
