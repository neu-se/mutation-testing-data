  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "uplevel" regardless of the actual difference in the number of path parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "internal" if the number of path parts is the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff === 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "uplevel" if the difference in the number of path parts is exactly 10.

DONE.
