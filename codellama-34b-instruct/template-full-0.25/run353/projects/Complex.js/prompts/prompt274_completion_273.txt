  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is swapped, which would cause the function to return the incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are added together, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are subtracted, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
