  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the index of the current element instead of the element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the element at the current index instead of the index itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[index] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the element at the current index plus one instead of the index itself.

DONE.
