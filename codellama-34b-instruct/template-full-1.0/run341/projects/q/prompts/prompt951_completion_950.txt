  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the arguments object, which is a built-in JavaScript object that provides access to the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with undefined would cause the function to use the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the arguments object to retrieve the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with null would cause the function to use the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the arguments object to retrieve the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to use the wrong arguments.

DONE.
