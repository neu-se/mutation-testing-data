  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` variable is an array, so the `Array.isArray` method would return `true` for `ops.ops` as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` variable is not an array, so the `Array.isArray` method would return `false` for `ops.ops` as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops.ops` property would have a length of 0, so the `ops.ops.length > 0` expression would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
