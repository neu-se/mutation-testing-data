  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `fs.promises.access`, which is asynchronous and returns a promise, while `fs.accessSync` is synchronous and does not return a promise. This change would result in the code functioning differently and potentially causing issues if the code relies on the asynchronous behavior of `fs.promises.access`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to combine the `R_OK` and `W_OK` constants, while this change would only check for the `W_OK` constant. This could result in the code allowing writes to the file even if the user does not have permission to do so.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await fs.promises.access(path.join(targetBasePath, targetFilePath), fs.constants
