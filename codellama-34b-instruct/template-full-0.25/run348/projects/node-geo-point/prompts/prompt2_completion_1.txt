  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the latitude is less than -90 or greater than 90, but this new code fragment also checks if the latitude is equal to 0. This would cause the `RangeError` to be thrown for a different set of inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the latitude is less than -90 or greater than 90, but this new code fragment also checks if the latitude is equal to 90. This would cause the `RangeError` to be thrown for a different set of inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < -90 || latitude > 90 || latitude === 180
```
