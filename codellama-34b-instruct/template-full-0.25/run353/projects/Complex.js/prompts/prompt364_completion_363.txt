  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is a variable, while the replaced code fragment is `-b`, which is the negative of the variable. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is a variable, while the replaced code fragment is `b + 1`, which is the variable plus one. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `b`, which is a variable, while the replaced code fragment is `b * 2`, which is the variable multiplied by two. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to errors in the
