Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.special === Special.Title && (c === "t" || c === "T")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `special` is `Title` and the character is either "t" or "T", which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.special !== Special.None
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for specific characters "s" or "S" and only checks if `special` is not `None`, which could lead to incorrect state transitions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this.xmlMode && (c === "x" || c === "X")
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new condition that checks for characters "x" or "X" instead of "s" or "S", and also checks the `xmlMode` property, which could lead to different state transitions and incorrect parsing.

DONE.
