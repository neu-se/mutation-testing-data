  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an integer, while `a + 1` is a float. This could cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which could in turn affect the result of the `acosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is an integer, while `b - 1` is a float. This could cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which could in turn affect the result of the `acosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` and `b` are both integers, while `a * b` is a float. This could cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, which could in turn affect the
