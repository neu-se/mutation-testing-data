  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different property than `ctx`, and could potentially return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.query
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.query` is a different property than `ctx`, and could potentially return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path.query
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path.query` is a different property than `ctx`, and could potentially return a different value.

DONE.
