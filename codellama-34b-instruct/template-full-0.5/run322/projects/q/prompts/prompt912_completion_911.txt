  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the function to behave differently when the `nodeArgs` array is passed to the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method removes the first element of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently when the `nodeArgs` array is passed to the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).concat(["foo"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat(["foo"])` method adds the string "foo" to the end of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently when
