Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of `point1` instead of `point2`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the latitude property of `point2` instead of converting it to radians, which would cause the distance calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the longitude of `point1` instead of the latitude of `point2`, which would lead to an erroneous distance calculation.

DONE.
