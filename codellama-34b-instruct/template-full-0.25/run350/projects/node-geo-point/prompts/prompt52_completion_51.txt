  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

DONE.
