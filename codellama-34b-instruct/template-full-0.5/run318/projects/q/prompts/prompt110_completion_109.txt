  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] + value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this replacement performs addition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] * value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this replacement performs multiplication.

DONE.
