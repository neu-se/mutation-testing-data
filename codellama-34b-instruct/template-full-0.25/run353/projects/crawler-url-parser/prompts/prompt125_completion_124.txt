  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl == "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the new code fragment checks if it is an object. If `linkurl` is not a string, the new code fragment will return `false` for the `gettype` function, while the original code fragment would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl == "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the new code fragment checks if it is undefined. If `linkurl` is undefined, the new code fragment will return `false` for the `gettype` function, while the original code fragment would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl == "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `linkurl` is a string, but
