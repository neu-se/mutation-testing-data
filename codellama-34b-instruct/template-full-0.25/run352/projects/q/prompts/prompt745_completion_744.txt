  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a different function than `onRejected`, and would be called when the promise is fulfilled, rather than when it is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and would be called when the promise is rejected, rather than when it is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected, and would not have the same behavior as `onFulfilled` or `onRejected`.

DONE.
