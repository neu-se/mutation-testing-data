  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), whereas `Math.expm1()` returns the mathematical constant `e` raised to the power of the number minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log()` returns the natural logarithm of the number, whereas `Math.expm1()` returns the exponential value of a number minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(-1)` returns the number `e` raised to the power of -1, whereas `Math.expm1()` returns the exponential value of a number minus one.

DONE.
