  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` variable is expected to be a string, but this code fragment checks if it's equal to the number 1, which would always be false and potentially cause the code to skip over important logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` variable is expected to be a string, but this code fragment checks if it is not equal to the string `"string"`, which is always true and would cause the code to execute unnecessary logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` variable is expected to be a string, but this code fragment checks if its length is greater than 0, which would always be true and cause the code to execute unnecessary logic.

DONE.
