  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the imaginary part of the complex number to be negated, resulting in a different calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the square of the imaginary part of the complex number would be used in the calculation, resulting in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional 1 would be added to the imaginary part of the complex number, resulting in a different calculation.

DONE.
