  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, regardless of whether all promises have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when the number of resolved promises is equal to the number of promises in the array, instead of when all promises have been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when the number of resolved promises is one less than the number of promises in the array, instead of when all promises have been resolved.

DONE.
