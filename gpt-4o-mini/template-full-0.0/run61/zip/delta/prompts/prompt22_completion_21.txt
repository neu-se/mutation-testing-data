Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider `null` as a different value than `undefined`, potentially leading to attributes being included in the result that should be excluded when comparing two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include attributes where the values are strictly equal, which could lead to missing attributes that are equal in value but not in type (e.g., `0` vs. `false`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose inequality, which could incorrectly identify attributes as different when they are actually equivalent (e.g., `0` and `false` would be considered equal, leading to unexpected results).

DONE.
