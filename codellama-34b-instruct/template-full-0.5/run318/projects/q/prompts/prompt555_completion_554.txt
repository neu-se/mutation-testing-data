  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `errback` function, which is not a method that exists on the `errback` function. This would likely result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called as a callback. This would likely result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error("This is a bug!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expression is not the same as the original `errback` function, and therefore would not have the same behavior. This would likely result in a different error being thrown.

DONE.
