  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce(predicate, initialValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the initialValue is not
being passed through to the reduce method, resulting in the accumulated
value starting with the first element of the ops array, instead of the
provided initialValue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduceRight(predicate, initialValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the reduce method is being
replaced with reduceRight, which iterates through the array in reverse order.
This would result in a different accumulated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce(predicate, other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the initialValue is being
passed as the ops array of the other Delta instance, instead of the
provided initialValue. This would result in a different accumulated value.

DONE.
