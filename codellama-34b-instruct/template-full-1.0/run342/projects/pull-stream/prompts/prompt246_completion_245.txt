  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `err` as an argument, which is not what the original code fragment does. The original fragment does not call `cb` with any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `data` as an argument, which is not what the original code fragment does. The original fragment does not call `cb` with any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and `data` as the second argument, which is not what the original code fragment does. The original fragment does not call `cb` with any arguments.

DONE.
