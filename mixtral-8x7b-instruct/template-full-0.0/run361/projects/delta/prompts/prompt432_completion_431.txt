 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous Op in the ops array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a runtime error when trying to access properties of the undefined variable 'nextOp'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next Op in the ops array instead of the current one.

DONE.
