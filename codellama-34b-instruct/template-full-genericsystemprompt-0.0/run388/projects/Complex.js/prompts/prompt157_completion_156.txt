  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Math.pow(a, z['re']), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a real part equal to `a` raised to the power of `z['re']`, and an imaginary part equal to 0, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, Math.pow(b, z['re']));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number with a real part equal to 0, and an imaginary part equal to `b` raised to the power of `z['re']`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Math.pow(a, z['re']) + Math.pow(b, z['re']), 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a complex number
