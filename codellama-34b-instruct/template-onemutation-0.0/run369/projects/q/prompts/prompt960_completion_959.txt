  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its first argument, but `null` is not an array. In the original code, `arguments` is passed as the first argument, which is an array-like object that contains the values of the function's arguments. Replacing `arguments` with `null` would cause the `array_slice` function to throw an error.
