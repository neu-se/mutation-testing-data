  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the element to be removed would be incorrect, leading to the wrong element being removed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the 'splice' method is the number of elements to be removed, and passing only the index would remove a single element starting from that index, rather than removing all elements up to and including the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the element to be removed would be incorrect, leading to an incorrect element being removed from the array.

DONE.
