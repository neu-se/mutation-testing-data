  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re']) && isNaN(z['im'])
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a logical AND operator instead of a logical OR operator. This change will cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called only if both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are NaN, which may be a more desirable behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(z['re']) || !isNaN(z['im'])
```
This code fragment is the logical negation of the original code fragment. It will cause the `parser_exit()` function to be called if either the real or imaginary part of the complex number is not NaN, which may be a more desirable behavior in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) && isFinite(z['im'])
```
This code fragment checks if both the real and imaginary parts of the
