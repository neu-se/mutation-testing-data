  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the value of the `deprecated` property in the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `deprecated` property in the `options` object is `true`, and would return `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `deprecated` property in the `options` object is not `true`, and would return `false` otherwise.

DONE.
