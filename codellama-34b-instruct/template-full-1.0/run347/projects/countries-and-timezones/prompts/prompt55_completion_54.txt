  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` when used in the `deliverTimezones` function would pass on the `options` parameter as a plain object. But with the substitution `{ ...options, undefined }`, the `deliverTimezones` function would receive an object with an additional `undefined` property, which would cause the function to throw an error when trying to access the `deprecated` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` when used in the `deliverTimezones` function would pass on the `options` parameter as a plain object. But with the substitution `{ ...options, foo: 'bar' }`, the `deliverTimezones` function would receive an object with an additional `foo` property set to `'bar'`, which would cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 3:
