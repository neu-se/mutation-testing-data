  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `"get"` operation instead of the `"post"` operation, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `"set"` operation instead of the `"post"` operation, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `"delete"` operation instead of the `"post"` operation, which would result in a different set of arguments being passed to the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
