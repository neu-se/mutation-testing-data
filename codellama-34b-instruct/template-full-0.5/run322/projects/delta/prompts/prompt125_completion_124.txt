  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
  firstLeft -= thisIter.peekLength();
  ops.push(thisIter.next());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
  firstLeft -= thisIter.peekLength();
  ops.push(thisIter.next());
} else {
  ops.push(thisIter.next());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else` block would always push the next operation to the `ops` array, regardless of whether the `if` condition is satisfied or not.

Option 3:
