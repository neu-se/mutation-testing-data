  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `thenReject` method would never be called, and the promise would never be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `thenReject` method would never be called, and the promise would never be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Rejection reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the given rejection reason.

DONE.
