  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.directory` is a method that adds a directory to the archive. Using `zipArchive.file` would cause the code to add a file to the archive instead of a directory, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
