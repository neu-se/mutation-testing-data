  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `sink.abort` if `read` is truthy, but this new code fragment calls `sink.abort` unconditionally, which could cause the `sink` function to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
