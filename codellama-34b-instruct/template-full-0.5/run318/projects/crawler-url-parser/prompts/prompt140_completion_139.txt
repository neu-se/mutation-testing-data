  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `i` flag would cause the regular expression to match the pattern in a case-insensitive manner, so it would also match URLs that contain uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/u
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `u` flag would cause the regular expression to match the pattern in a Unicode-aware manner, so it would also match URLs that contain non-ASCII characters.

DONE.
