  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a function to `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the wrong argument.

DONE.
