  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the text is null, while this replacement is checking the length of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the text is null, while this replacement is converting the text to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the text is null, while this replacement is splitting the text into an array of words and checking the length of the array.

DONE.
