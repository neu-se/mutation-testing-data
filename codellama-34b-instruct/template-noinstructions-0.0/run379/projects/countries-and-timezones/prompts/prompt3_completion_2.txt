  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return `null` instead of a map object, causing the `buildCountry` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `id` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return an empty object instead of a map object, causing the `buildCountry` function to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ id: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return an object with a `null` value for the `id` property, causing the `buildCountry` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `name` property of `null`.

DONE.
