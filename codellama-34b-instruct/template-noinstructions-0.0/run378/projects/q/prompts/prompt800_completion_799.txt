  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.resolve(value);
}, function (exception) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.reject(exception);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only had a rejection handler, but this new code fragment has both a rejection and a fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (value) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.resolve(value);
}, function (exception) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.reject(exception);
}).catch(function (error) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    deferred.reject(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only had a rejection handler, but this new code fragment has both a rejection and a fulfillment handler, as well
