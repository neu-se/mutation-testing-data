  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, replacing 'i' with 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, replacing 'i' with 'us'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + w.substr(w.length - 2, 2) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, repeating the last two letters.

DONE.
