  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(p => p.name !== policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out the current policy from the list of policies, which could potentially result in a different policy being applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(0, policies.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last policy from the list of policies, which could potentially result in a different policy being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the policies, which could potentially result in a different policy being applied.

DONE.
