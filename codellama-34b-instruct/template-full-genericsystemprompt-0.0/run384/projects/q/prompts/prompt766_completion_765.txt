  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message, whereas the original code fragment would not reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Buggy code"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error message, whereas the original code fragment would not reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("Buggy code"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the given error message, whereas the original code fragment would not fulfill the promise.

DONE.
