  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for a length less than or equal to 0, while the new code would check for a length greater than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for a length less than or equal to 0, while the new code would check for a length that is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for a length less than or equal to 0, while the new code would check for a length that is equal to 0.

DONE.
