  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is not 0, which would result in a different return value for the `toString` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is greater than 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is greater than 0, which would result in a different return value for the `toString` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b`
