  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile` is a different function than `_readFile`, and it has a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `readFile`, and it has a different implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `writeFile`, and it has a different implementation.

DONE.
