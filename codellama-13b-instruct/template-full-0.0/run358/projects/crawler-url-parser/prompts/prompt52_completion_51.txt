  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.protocol` property is a string, while the original code fragment `parsedUrl` is an object. This would cause the `typeof` operator to return a different result, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.host` property is a string, while the original code fragment `parsedUrl` is an object. This would cause the `typeof` operator to return a different result, which could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.pathname` property is a string, while the original code fragment `parsedUrl` is an object. This would cause the `typeof` operator to return a different result, which could affect
