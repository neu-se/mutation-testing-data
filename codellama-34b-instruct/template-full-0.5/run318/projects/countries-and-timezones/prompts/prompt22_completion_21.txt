  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tz.d` property is being incremented by 1, which would change the value of `dstOffset` and potentially cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tz.d` property is being multiplied by 2, which would change the value of `dstOffset` and potentially cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tz.d` property is being decremented by 1, which would change the value of `dstOffset` and potentially cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a different string.

DONE.
