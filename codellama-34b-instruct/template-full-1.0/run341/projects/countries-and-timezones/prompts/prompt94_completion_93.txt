  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` and `countryId` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.country
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different object property to the function.

DONE.
