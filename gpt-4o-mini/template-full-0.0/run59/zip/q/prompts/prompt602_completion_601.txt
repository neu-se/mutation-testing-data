Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `null`, leading to a runtime error instead of attempting to dispatch the operation on the intended object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also lead to a runtime error when trying to call the `dispatch` method on `undefined`, which is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `dispatch` method on a string, which is not a valid object for the operation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
