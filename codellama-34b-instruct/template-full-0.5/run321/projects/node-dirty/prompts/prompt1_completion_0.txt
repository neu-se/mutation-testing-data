  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` method clears the entire Map, whereas the original code only clears the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value stored in the Map, whereas the original code stores the value as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null`, whereas the original code sets the value to the `val` parameter.

DONE.
