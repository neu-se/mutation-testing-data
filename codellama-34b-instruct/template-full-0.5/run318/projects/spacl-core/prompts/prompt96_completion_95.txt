  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set()` is a method that sets a property on the object, while `policy.name, policy` is a comma-separated list of values that are not used in the `set()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.name` is a string, and `policy.name, policy` is a comma-separated list of values that are not used in the `set()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `set()` method, but `policy.name, policy` is not.

DONE.
