  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport++
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` would be incremented even if the rejection was not handled, leading to a false positive in `array_indexOf`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` would never be empty, and the check for `atReport !== -1` would always pass, leading to duplicate `unhandledRejection` events.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` would always be one element shorter than the actual number of unhandled rejections, leading to missed `unhandledRejection` events.

DONE.
