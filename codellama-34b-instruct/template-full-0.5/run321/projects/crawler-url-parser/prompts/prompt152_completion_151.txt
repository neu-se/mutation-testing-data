  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "sublevel" instead of "internal" when the link URL has one more path part than the page URL, which is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "uplevel" instead of "internal" when the page URL has one more path part than the link URL, which is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length == pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "samelevel" instead of "internal" when the link URL and page URL have the same number of path parts, which is not correct.

DONE.
