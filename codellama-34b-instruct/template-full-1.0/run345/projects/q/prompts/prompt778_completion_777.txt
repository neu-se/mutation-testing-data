  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect('fulfilled');
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` expects a function as its first argument, but a string is being passed instead. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would mean that the promise is rejected, even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` expects a function as its first argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would mean that the promise is rejected, even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(function () { return 'fulfilled'; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `promise.inspect()` always returns the same string, regardless of the state of the promise. This would cause
