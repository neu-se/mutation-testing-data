  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype`, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(this).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `this`, and then call the `inspect` method on that promise, which would return the current state of the promise, rather than the state of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.resolve(this).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resolve` method of the `this` promise's constructor, rather than the `resolve` method of the `Promise` prototype, which would return a new promise that resolves to the current state of `this`, and then call the `inspect` method on that promise, which would return the current state
