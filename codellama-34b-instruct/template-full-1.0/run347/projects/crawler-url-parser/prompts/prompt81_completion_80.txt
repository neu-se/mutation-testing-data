  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used to specify the URL of the image, rather than the `href` attribute which is used to specify the URL of the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'[0]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `extract` function would now be extracting the first element of the `parsedUrl` object, rather than extracting the `href` attribute of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'alt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `alt` attribute is used to specify the alternative text for an image, rather than the `href` attribute which is used to specify the URL of the link.

DONE.
