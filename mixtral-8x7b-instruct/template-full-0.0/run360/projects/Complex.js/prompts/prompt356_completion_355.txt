 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when b is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when b is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when b is 0.

DONE.
