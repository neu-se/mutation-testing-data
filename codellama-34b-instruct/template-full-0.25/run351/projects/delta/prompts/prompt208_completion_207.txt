  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `chop()` is a method that removes leading and trailing empty operations from a delta, but it does not return a new delta object, so it would not work as a replacement for `concat()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` is a method that returns a new delta object that is the concatenation of the current delta and the `other` delta, but it does not modify the current delta object, so it would not work as a replacement for `concat()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` returns a new delta object that is the concatenation of the current delta and the `other` delta, and `chop()` removes leading and trailing empty operations from the resulting delta object, so it would work as a replacement for `concat
