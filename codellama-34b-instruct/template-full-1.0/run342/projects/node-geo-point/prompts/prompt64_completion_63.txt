  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `cos` have different implementations and return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `1` to the result of `cos` changes the value and produces a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(Math.PI - angle)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Math.cos` is applied to the difference of `Math.PI` and the input angle, which produces a different result than using `cos` directly.

DONE.
