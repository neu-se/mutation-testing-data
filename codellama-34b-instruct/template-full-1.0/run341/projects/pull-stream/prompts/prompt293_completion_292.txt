  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function and does not have a `length` property, whereas the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof test === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function, not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test() > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a function that returns a number, and `test()` would invoke that function, whereas the original code fragment checks if the function itself is greater than 10.

DONE.
