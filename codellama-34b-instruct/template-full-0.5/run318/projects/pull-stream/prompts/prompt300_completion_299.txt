  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last
```
This would result in different behavior because `last` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the last item in the stream should be returned, whereas `ended` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the stream has ended. Using `last` instead of `ended` would cause the function to return the last item in the stream even if it has not ended, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended` is a boolean variable that indicates whether the stream has ended, whereas `!ended` is a boolean expression that indicates whether the stream has not ended. Using `!ended` instead of `ended` would cause the function to return the last item in the stream even if it has not ended, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value, whereas `
