Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to unexpected results in the callback, as `undefined` is not a valid value for the expected output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the current value of `i` instead of `null` would cause the callback to receive the current index instead of a null value, potentially altering the logic that depends on the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `null` would indicate a successful operation rather than a lack of value, which could mislead the caller about the state of the operation.

DONE.
