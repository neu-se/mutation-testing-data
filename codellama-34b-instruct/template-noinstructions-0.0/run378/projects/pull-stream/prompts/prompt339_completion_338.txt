  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could cause the `unique` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could cause the `unique` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified, which could cause the `unique` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
