  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb()` is a function call with an empty argument list. This could potentially cause the callback to be called with an unexpected number of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb(null)` is a function call with a single argument. This could potentially cause the callback to be called with an unexpected number of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `cb(undefined)` is a function call with a single argument. This could potentially cause the callback to be called with an unexpected number of arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
