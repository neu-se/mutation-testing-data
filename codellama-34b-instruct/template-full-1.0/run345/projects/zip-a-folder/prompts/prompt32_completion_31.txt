  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because when a file stream emits an 'end' event, it means that there is no more data to be read from the stream. In contrast, when a file stream emits an 'error' event, it means that the stream encountered an error while reading or writing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because when a file stream emits a 'close' event, it means that the stream has been closed. In contrast, when a file stream emits an 'error' event, it means that the stream encountered an error while reading or writing data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because when a file stream emits a 'finish' event, it means that all the data has been written to the stream. In contrast, when a file stream emits an 'error' event, it means that the
