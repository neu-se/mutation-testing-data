  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the first `n` elements of the original array, where `n` is the argument passed to the method. In this case, the argument is `0`, which means that the new array will contain all the elements of the original array except for the last one. This means that the `for` loop will iterate over all the elements of the array except for the last one, which could cause the loop to skip over the last policy in the collection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the last `n` elements of the original array, where `n` is the argument passed to the method. In this case, the argument is `1`, which means that the new array will contain all the elements of the original array except for the first one. This means that the `for
