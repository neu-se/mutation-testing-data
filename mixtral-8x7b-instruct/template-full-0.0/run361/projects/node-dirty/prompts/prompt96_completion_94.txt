 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'key' is an own property of the row object, instead of checking if 'key' exists as a property in the row object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' !== Object.keys(row)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'key' is not equal to the first key in the row object, instead of checking if 'key' exists as a property in the row object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.constructor.prototype.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'key' is not an own property of the prototype of the row object's constructor, instead of checking if 'key' exists as a property in the row object.

DONE.
