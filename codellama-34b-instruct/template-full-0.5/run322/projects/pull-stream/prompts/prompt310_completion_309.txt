  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the result of the `test` function, while this replacement code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the `data` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the result of the `test` function, while this replacement code fragment uses the `test` function directly without negating its result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data != test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the result of the `test` function, while this replacement code fragment uses the inequality operator to compare the `data` variable to the `test` function.

DONE.
