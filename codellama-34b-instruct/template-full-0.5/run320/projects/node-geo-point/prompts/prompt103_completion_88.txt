  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the starting point instead of the destination point, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude of the destination point, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude of the destination point, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
