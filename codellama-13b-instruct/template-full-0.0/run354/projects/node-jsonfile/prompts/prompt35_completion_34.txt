  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `str` variable to be coerced into a number, and then added to 1, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `str` variable, which is a string, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `str` variable to uppercase, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
