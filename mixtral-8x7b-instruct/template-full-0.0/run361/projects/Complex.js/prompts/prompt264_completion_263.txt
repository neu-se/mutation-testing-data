 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return atan2(1, a), instead of using the 'im' property of the current complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the division operator instead of the subtraction operator, potentially leading to incorrect results when 'a' is negative or zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the negative value of the 'im' property, regardless of the sign of 'b'.

DONE.
