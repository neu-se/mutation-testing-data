Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the output from the original data to a value that is incremented by 1, which may not be the intended transformation of the stream data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original data with `null`, which would cause the consumer of the stream to receive a `null` value instead of the actual data, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the output to the length of the data (assuming data is an array or string), which may not be the intended output and could lead to incorrect processing of the stream's contents.

DONE.
