 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is immediately wrapped in a resolved promise, changing the execution context of the continuation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(callback)
