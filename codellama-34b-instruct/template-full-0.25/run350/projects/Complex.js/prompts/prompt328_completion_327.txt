  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which returns the value of the variable `a`. The modified code fragment `-a` returns the negative value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which returns the value of the variable `a`. The modified code fragment `a + 1` returns the value of `a` plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a`, which returns the value of the variable `a`. The modified code fragment `a * b` returns the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
