  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the `cb` variable, which is a function in the original code. In the mutated code, `!cb` would evaluate to `false` if `cb` is a function, which would cause the `while` loop to terminate immediately, even if there are more data to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to the first falsy value in the expression, which would be `cb` if it is a function. In the mutated code, `cb && data` would evaluate to `cb` if `cb` is a function, which would cause the `while` loop to terminate immediately, even if there are more data to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.map(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
