  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is not a method of the promise object, whereas `closed.resolve` and `closed.reject` are.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the error object, whereas `closed.resolve` and `closed.reject` do not take any arguments.

DONE.
