  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` returns a string representation of the promise's state, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the promise's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value; }, function (reason) { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the first callback function, and rejects with the return value of the second callback function, whereas `regardless` is a
