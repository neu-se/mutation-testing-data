  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at - 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the unhandled rejection would be off by one, causing a different value to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at + 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the unhandled rejection would be off by one in the opposite direction, causing a different value to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at] + 1, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the unhandled rejection would be incremented by one, causing a different value to be emitted.

DONE.
