  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the `newOp` object, whereas the original code fragment only creates a shallow copy. This could cause issues if the `newOp` object has nested objects or arrays, as the deep copy would ensure that those nested objects are also copied, whereas the shallow copy would only copy the reference to those objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the `newOp` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the spread operator to create a shallow copy. This could cause issues if the `newOp` object has nested objects or arrays, as the shallow copy would only copy the reference to those objects, whereas the deep copy created by `Object.assign` would ensure that those nested objects are also copied.
