  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a null value, regardless of whether the abort signal is received or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return an undefined value, regardless of whether the abort signal is received or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return true, regardless of whether the abort signal is received or not.

DONE.
