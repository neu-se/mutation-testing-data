  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This change will cause the function to use the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific use case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This change will cause the function to use the last element of the `ref` array instead of the first, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific use case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * ref.length)]
```
This change will cause the function to use a random element of the `ref` array instead of the first, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific use case.

DONE.
