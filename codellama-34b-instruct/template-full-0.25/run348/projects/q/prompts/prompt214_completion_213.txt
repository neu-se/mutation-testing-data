  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return "object" for any non-null object, including thenables that are not promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` would only return true for objects that are instances of the `Object` constructor, which would exclude thenables that are not promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === "[object Object]"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` would return "[object Object]" for any non-null object, including thenables that are not promises.

DONE.
