  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function, which would create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function. However, the `continuer` function is not a constructor function, so it cannot be used with the `new` operator to create a new instance. Therefore, the code would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with a `null` context, which would mean that the `continuer` function would be called with a `this` value of `null`. However, the `continuer` function is defined as a method of the `Q` object, so it would not be able to access the `Q` object's properties and methods without a valid `
