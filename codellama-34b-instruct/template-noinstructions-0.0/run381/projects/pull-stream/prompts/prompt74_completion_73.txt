  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort || true` would always return `true` if `abort` is truthy, while the new code fragment `abort || false` would return `false` if `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort || true` would always return `true` if `abort` is falsy, while the new code fragment `abort && true` would return `false` if `abort` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort || true` would always return `true` if `abort` is falsy, while the new code fragment `!abort` would return `false` if `abort` is f
