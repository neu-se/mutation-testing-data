Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to different handling in downstream code that expects a specific value, potentially causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `null` could cause the callback to be interpreted as a successful operation, which may lead to incorrect assumptions about the state of the stream or data being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the `data` variable instead of `null` would change the output of the callback, potentially leading to the consumer of the stream receiving unexpected data instead of a signal that no data is available.

DONE.
