  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap == {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this replacement only checks if it's an empty object. If `timezonesMap` is not an empty object, the replacement would evaluate to `false` even if it has elements in it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this replacement only checks if it has a length of 0. If `timezonesMap` is not falsy, the replacement would evaluate to `false` even if it has elements in it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.current == {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this replacement only checks
