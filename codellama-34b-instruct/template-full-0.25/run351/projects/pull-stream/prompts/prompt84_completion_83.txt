  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of the `abort` variable, while the new code fragment is always passing `null` as the first argument to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of the `abort` variable, while the new code fragment is always passing `undefined` as the first argument to the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the presence of the `abort` variable, while the new code fragment is always passing `false` as the first argument to the `read` function.

DONE.
