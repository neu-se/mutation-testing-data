  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value and thus would not trigger the flushing process, while `0` is a falsy value and thus would trigger the flushing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value and thus would not trigger the flushing process, while `0` is a falsy value and thus would trigger the flushing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `-1` is a truthy value and thus would trigger the flushing process, while `0` is a falsy value and thus would not trigger the flushing process.

DONE.
