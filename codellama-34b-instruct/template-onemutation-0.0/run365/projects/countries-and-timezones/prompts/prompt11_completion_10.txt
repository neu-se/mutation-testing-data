  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object, while `Object.assign` returns a new object with the own enumerable string keyed properties of one or more source objects.

DONE.
