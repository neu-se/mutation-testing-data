  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation, not just the remaining length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(Op.length(otherOp) - iter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the other operation, not just the remaining length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain(Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength(), AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation and update the attributes to reflect the difference between the two operations.

DONE.
