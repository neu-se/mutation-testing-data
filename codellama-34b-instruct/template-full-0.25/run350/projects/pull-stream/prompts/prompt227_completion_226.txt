  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which means that it will return the opposite of the boolean value of `test`. If `test` is a function, it will return `true` if the function returns `false`, and `false` if the function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which means that it will return `true` if both operands are `true`, and `false` otherwise. If `test` is a function, it will return `false` if the function returns `false`, and `true` if the function returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which means that it will return `true` if either operand is `true`, and `false
