  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>).delay(timeout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.delay()` method is not defined on all objects and will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality and will return `true` if the value on the left is the same as the value on the right, and `false` otherwise. In this case, it would return `false` unless the `PLACEHOLDER` variable is explicitly set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER> === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality and will return `true` if the value on the left is the same as the value on the right, and `false` otherwise. In this case, it would
