 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"\n<script>console.log('This is an injected script');</script>\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it injects a script tag into the stack trace, which is not present in the original code. This would cause the browser to execute the injected script, leading to unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"\n<!-- This is an injected comment -->\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it injects a comment into the stack trace, which is not present in the original code. While comments do not affect the functionality, they can alter the appearance and structure of the stack trace, making it harder to read and analyze.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"\n" + Math.random() + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a random number in the stack trace, which is not present in the original code.
