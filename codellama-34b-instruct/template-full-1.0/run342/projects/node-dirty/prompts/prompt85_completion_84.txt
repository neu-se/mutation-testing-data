  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds elements to the beginning of an array, whereas `split` would split a string into an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the length of an array, whereas `split` would split a string into an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of an array, whereas `split` would split a string into an array of substrings.

DONE.
