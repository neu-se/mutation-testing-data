  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angle between the two points, while this replacement code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the angle between the two points. This would lead to different results in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the angle between the two points, while this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angle between the two points. This would lead to different results in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cos
