  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a promise that has not yet been resolved, so the `rejected` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that takes an error object as an argument, but the `deferred` object does not have a `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that takes an error object as an argument, but the `deferred` object does not have a `reject` method.

DONE.
