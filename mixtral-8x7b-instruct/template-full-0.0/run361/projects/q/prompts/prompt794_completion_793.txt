 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method treats `null` and `undefined` differently. In the original code, passing `undefined` as an argument to `then` would ignore the argument, while passing `null` would treat it as a function that does nothing. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the argument being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional function to the `then` method's `onFulfilled` array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the exact number of functions in the array or if the additional function changes the behavior of the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method of the `deferred` object immediately, instead of waiting for the
