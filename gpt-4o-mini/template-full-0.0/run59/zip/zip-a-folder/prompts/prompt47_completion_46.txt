Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + '/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the source path is interpreted, potentially including additional files or directories that were not intended to be included in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only takes the first part of the source string if it contains multiple paths, which may lead to missing files that should have been included in the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the source path string to uppercase, which may not match the actual file system path, leading to a failure in locating the directory to archive.

DONE.
