  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This change will cause the `break` statement to be executed when `this._waitForDrain` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === 0
```
This change will cause the `break` statement to be executed when `this._waitForDrain` is equal to `0`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain < 0
```
This change will cause the `break` statement to be executed when `this._waitForDrain` is less than `0`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
