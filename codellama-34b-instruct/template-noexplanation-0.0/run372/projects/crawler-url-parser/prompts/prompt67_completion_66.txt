  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This change will cause the `split` method to split the string at every character that is not equal to the delimiter, rather than at every occurrence of the delimiter. This will result in a different number of elements in the resulting array, which may cause the `map` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+"
```
This change will cause the `split` method to split the string at every character that is not a plus sign, rather than at every occurrence of the delimiter. This will result in a different number of elements in the resulting array, which may cause the `map` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"*"
```
This change will cause the `split` method to split the string at every character that is not a multiplication sign, rather than at every occurrence of the delimiter. This will result in a different number of elements in the resulting array, which may cause the `map` function to behave differently.
