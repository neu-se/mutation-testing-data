  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is not a method of the `Promise` prototype, and it would likely cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is not a method of the `Promise` prototype, and it would likely cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a method of the `Promise` prototype, and it would likely cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
