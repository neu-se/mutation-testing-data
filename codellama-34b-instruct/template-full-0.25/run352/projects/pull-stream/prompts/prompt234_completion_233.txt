  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data.toUpperCase()` is a string with all characters in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data.split('')` is an array of strings, each containing a single character from the original string.

DONE.
