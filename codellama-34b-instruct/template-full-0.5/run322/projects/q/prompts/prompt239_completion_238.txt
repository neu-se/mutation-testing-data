  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original promise object that was resolved, instead of the resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is already resolved, instead of returning the resolved promise.

DONE.
