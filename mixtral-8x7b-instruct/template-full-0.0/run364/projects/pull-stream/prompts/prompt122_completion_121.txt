 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source.push(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the data to the sink function, it is added to the source object which was not the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
source.remove(data)
