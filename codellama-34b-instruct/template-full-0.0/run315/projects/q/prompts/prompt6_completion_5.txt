  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof exports` check would fail, causing the code to enter the `else` block and execute the `module.exports = definition();` statement, which would export the `definition` function as a module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof module` check would fail, causing the code to enter the `else` block and execute the `module.exports = definition();` statement, which would export the `definition` function as a module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because both `typeof exports` and `typeof module` checks would fail, causing the code to enter the `else` block and execute the `module.exports = definition();` statement,
