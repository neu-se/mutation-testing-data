  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to skip every other line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to start at the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be doubled, which would cause the loop to iterate over every other line.

DONE.
