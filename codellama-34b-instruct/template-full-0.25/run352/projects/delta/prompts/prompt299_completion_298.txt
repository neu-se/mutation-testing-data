  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the line, rather than the line itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line without the first character, rather than the line itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the line in uppercase, rather than the line itself.

DONE.
