  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array and would result in an error when passed to the `Promise.prototype.nfapply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array `[]` would not include the required arguments for the `Promise.prototype.nfapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because a different set of arguments `[1, 2, 3]` would be passed to the `Promise.prototype.nfapply` method, which could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
