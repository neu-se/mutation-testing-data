Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because using `call` instead of `apply` would not correctly pass the arguments as an array, potentially leading to incorrect argument handling in the wrapped function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because using `bind` would create a new function with a fixed `this` context, which may not be appropriate for the intended use of `denodeify`, altering how the function behaves when invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because directly calling `Q.denodeify` with `args` would not provide the correct context and would not wrap the function as intended, leading to a failure in handling the Node-style callback properly.

DONE.
