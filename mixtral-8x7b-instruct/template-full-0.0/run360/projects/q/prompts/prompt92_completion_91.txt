 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value check would always pass, bypassing the loop to find the first value in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value check would use the length property instead of checking the number of arguments, potentially causing incorrect behavior when the length is greater than 0 but no arguments are provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_indexOf(value, this) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is the first element in the array, rather than checking if there is only one argument. This could lead to incorrect behavior when the value is at any index other than the first.

DONE.
