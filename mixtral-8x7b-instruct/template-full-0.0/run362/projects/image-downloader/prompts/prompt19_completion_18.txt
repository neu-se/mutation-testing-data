 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options.dest` is an empty string instead of checking if it's an absolute path. This could cause issues if the `options.dest` is an empty string, and the code might resolve the destination to an unexpected directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.win32.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for absolute paths only in the Windows file system, while the original code checks for all file systems. This could cause issues if the code is running on a non-Windows system and the `options.dest` is an absolute path on that system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative(__dirname, options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options.dest` is in the same directory as the current module, instead of
