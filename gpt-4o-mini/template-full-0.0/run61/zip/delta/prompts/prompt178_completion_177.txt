Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of 0 for the `otherOp`, potentially causing the `thisIter.next(length)` to return an empty operation, which would alter the composition logic and result in missing operations in the final delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length used for the `otherOp` by 1, which could lead to an off-by-one error in the composition, potentially causing operations to be incorrectly merged or omitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation from `thisIter` plus one, which could lead to an incorrect length being passed to `otherIter.next()`, potentially causing operations to be skipped or incorrectly processed in the final delta.

DONE.
