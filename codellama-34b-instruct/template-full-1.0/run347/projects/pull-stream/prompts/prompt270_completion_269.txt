  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(stream && 'object' === typeof stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of the expression, so the resulting behavior would be the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'number' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'number'` if the `stream` variable is a number, which would be a different condition than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'function'` if the `stream` variable is a function, which would be a different condition than the original code.

DONE.
