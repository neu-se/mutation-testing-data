  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object to be passed to the callback, but `null` would be interpreted as a successful completion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object to be passed to the callback, but `undefined` would be interpreted as a successful completion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an error object to be passed to the callback, but `new Error('aborted')` would create a new error object with a different message.

DONE.
