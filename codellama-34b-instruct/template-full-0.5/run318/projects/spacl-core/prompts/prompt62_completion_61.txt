  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `props` array, which is then reversed. In contrast, `props.reverse()` reverses the `props` array in place, without creating a copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `props` array and an empty array, which is then reversed. In contrast, `props.reverse()` reverses the `props` array in place, without creating a copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `props` array, which is then reversed. In contrast, `props.reverse()` reverses the `props` array in
