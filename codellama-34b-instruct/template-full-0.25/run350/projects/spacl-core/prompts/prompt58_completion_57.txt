  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the second capture group, which may not exist in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string references the entire match, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string adds the string 'foo' to the end of the first capture group.

DONE.
