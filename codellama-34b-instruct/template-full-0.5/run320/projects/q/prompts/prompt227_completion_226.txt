  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` would always be truthy, even if `messages` is an empty array, which would cause the `else` block to be executed unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.includes(undefined)` would return `true` if `messages` contains `undefined`, which would cause the `else` block to be executed unconditionally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.indexOf(undefined) >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.indexOf(undefined)` would return the index of the first occurrence of `undefined` in `messages`, which would cause the `else` block to be executed unconditionally if `undefined` is found in `messages`.

DONE.
