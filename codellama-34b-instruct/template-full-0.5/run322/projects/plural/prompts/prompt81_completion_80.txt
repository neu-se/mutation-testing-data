  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would still match the word "goose" and return "geese" as the plural form, but it would not match any other words that end in "oose" and would not return the correct plural form for those words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese', 'golese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would match the word "goose" and return "geese" as the plural form, but it would also match the word "golese" and return "geese" as the plural form, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese', 'golese', 'geesee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would match the word "goose" and return "geese" as the plural form
