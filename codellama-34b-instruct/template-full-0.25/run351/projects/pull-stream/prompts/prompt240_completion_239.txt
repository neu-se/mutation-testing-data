  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator would invert the value of `end`, causing the `cb` function to be called with the opposite value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end + 1` expression would increment the value of `end` by 1, causing the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `cb` function as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
