  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the variable "x" from itself, which would result in a value of 0. Substituting "-1" would result in a value of -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the variable "x" from itself, which would result in a value of 0. Substituting "1+x" would result in a value of 1 + the value of "x".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the variable "x" from itself, which would result in a value of 0. Substituting "x*x" would result in a value of the square of the value of "x".

DONE.
