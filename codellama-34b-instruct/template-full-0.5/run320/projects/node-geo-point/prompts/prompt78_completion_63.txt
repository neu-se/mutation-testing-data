  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `sinφ2` instead of `sinφ1`, which would lead to a different calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2 * sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `cosφ1 * sinθ` instead of `cosφ2 * sinθ`, which would lead to a different calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * sinδ * cosθ + cosφ1 * sinδ * sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `sinφ2` instead of `sinφ1`, which would lead to a different calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
