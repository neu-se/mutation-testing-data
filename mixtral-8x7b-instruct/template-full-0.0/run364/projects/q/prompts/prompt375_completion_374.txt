 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify(newValue);` line would always execute, even if an exception was thrown in the `_progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify(newValue);` line would never execute, even if no exception was thrown in the `_progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require the `threw` variable to be defined and set to `false` in order for the `deferred.notify(newValue);` line to execute. If `threw` is not defined or is `true`, the line would not execute.

DONE.
