  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because this check would only return true if both the divisor and the dividend are infinite, while the original code would return true if either the divisor or the dividend is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because this check would compare the imaginary part of the divisor to the real part of the dividend, while the original code would compare the imaginary part of the divisor to the imaginary part of the dividend.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because this check would only return false if the imaginary part of the divisor is not zero, while the original code would return false if the divisor is zero or infinite.

DONE.
