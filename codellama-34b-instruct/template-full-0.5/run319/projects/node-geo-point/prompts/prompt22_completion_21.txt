  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an own property named 'latitude', which is not the same as checking if the object has a property named 'latitude' regardless of whether it is an own property or an inherited property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has an
