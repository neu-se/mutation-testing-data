  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the cb function to the cbs array, but it would not set the value of the key to the result of the function applied to the current value of the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the cb function from the cbs array, but it would not set the value of the key to the result of the function applied to the current value of the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to the cbs array, but it would not apply the function to the current value of the key.

DONE.
