 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the row string is empty after trimming whitespace, instead of just checking if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
