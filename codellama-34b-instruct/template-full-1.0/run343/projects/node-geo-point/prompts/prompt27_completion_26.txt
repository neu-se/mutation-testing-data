  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the point2 instead of point1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the point1 instead of the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude + point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitudes of the two points instead of using just one.

DONE.
