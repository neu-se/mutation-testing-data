 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it unnecessarily multiplies the result of `Math.sqrt` by 2, which would change the value of `re` in the `sqrt` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Math.exp` instead of `Math.sqrt`, which would lead to incorrect results in the `sqrt` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Math.abs` instead of `Math.sqrt`, which would lead to incorrect results in the `sqrt` method.

DONE.
