  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In the context of the `push` method, the `unshift` method would cause the `rules` array to be modified in a different way, potentially leading to different behavior in the `query` and `matches` methods.
