  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `args` argument to be passed as the `thisp` argument to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `this` object to be passed as the `args` argument to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `null` value to be passed as the `thisp` argument to the `callback` function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
