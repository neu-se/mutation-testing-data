  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<name>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string literal "<name>", rather than the value of the `name` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the uppercase version of the `name` variable, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the reverse of the `name` variable, rather than the original value.

DONE.
