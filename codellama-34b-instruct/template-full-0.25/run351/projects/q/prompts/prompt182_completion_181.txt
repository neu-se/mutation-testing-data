  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack trace, which may not contain the file name and line number information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").slice(1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the words after the first word of the stack trace, which may not contain the file name and line number information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").slice(2).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the words after the second word of the stack trace, which may not contain the file name and line number information.

DONE.
