  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
