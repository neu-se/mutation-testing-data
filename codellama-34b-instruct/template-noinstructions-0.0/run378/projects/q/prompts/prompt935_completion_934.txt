  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 1)` would return a new function that always slices the input array from the first element, whereas `array_slice` slices the input array from the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 0, 1)` would return a new function that always slices the input array from the first element to the second element, whereas `array_slice` slices the input array from the specified index to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null, 1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null, 1, 0)` would return a new
