  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && offset > index && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is false, while the new code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert', the offset is greater than the index, and if priority is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && offset >= index && !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert' and if the offset is less than the index or if priority is false, while the new code fragment checks if the next type is 'insert', the offset is greater than or equal to the index, and if priority is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && offset !== index && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next
