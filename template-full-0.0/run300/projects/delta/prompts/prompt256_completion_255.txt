  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for equality of the attributes of the two operations, which is not done in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) || thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the inserts are equal or if the attributes are not equal, which is not done in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the inserts are equal and if the attributes are not equal, which is not done in the original code fragment.

DONE.
