  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `set` to store a new key-value pair in the `Map` object, while this replacement uses `delete` to remove an existing key-value pair. This change would cause the `get` method to return undefined for the key, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `set` to store a new key-value pair in the `Map` object, while this replacement uses `set` to overwrite the existing value for the key. This change would cause the `get` method to return the new value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because
