  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to behave differently if the arguments have different types or if the function is sensitive to the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave differently if it is not designed to handle extra arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is being replaced with a different value, which could cause the function to behave differently if it is sensitive to the value of the third argument.

DONE.
