  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "samelevel" regardless of the actual relationship between the two URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"//"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "internal" regardless of the actual relationship between the two URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "external" regardless of the actual relationship between the two URLs.

DONE.
