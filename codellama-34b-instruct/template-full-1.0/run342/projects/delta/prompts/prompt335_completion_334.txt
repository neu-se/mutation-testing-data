  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, whereas the original code would return the attributes of the base operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, whereas the original code could return a non-null object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, whereas the original code could return a non-null object.

DONE.
