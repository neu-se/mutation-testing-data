  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is not the same as `'close'`, and the function `reject` is not the same as `resolve`. The former would cause the promise to be rejected, while the latter would cause it to be resolved.
