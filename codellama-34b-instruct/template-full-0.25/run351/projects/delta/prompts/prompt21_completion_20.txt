  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for inequality, not deep equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for inequality if `a[key]` is not undefined, which could lead to false positives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for inequality if `b[key]` is not undefined, which could lead to false negatives.

DONE.
