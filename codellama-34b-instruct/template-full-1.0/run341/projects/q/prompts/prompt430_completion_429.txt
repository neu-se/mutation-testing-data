  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state == "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is a different operator than `===`. In Javascript, `==` is used for type coercion, so it may cause unintended behavior in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "resolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is not a valid state of a promise, so this code would never match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().reason !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `.reason` is not a property of the `inspect` method's return value, so this code would throw an error.

DONE.
