  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the previous promise, while `ends.reject` will reject the promise with the specified error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the previous promise with the value `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the previous promise with the error object instead of the expected value.

DONE.
