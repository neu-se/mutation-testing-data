  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this replacement code fragment emits an error event with a new error object with a custom error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this replacement code fragment emits an error event with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this replacement code fragment emits an error event with an undefined value.

DONE.
