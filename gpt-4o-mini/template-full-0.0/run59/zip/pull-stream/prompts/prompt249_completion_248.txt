Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `abort` with `null` would cause the stream to continue processing without aborting, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors when the stream is expected to terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because using `true` instead of `abort` would signal that the stream should be aborted, but it would not carry the actual abort reason, which could lead to confusion or incorrect handling of the abort scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `abort` would not provide any abort signal, which may cause the stream to behave as if it is still active, potentially leading to further processing of data that should have been aborted.

DONE.
