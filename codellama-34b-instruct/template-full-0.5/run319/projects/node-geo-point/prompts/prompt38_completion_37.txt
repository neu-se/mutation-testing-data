  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the number 1, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to 1, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the `sin` function, which would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the `tan` function, which would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
