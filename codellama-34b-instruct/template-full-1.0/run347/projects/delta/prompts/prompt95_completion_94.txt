  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would modify the original array, whereas the original code fragment only modified a copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method would add the new operation to the beginning of the array, whereas the original code fragment added it to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add the new operation to the end of the array, whereas the original code fragment added it to the beginning.

DONE.
