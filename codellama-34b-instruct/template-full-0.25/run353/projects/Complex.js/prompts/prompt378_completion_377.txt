  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, whereas the original `a` expression would evaluate to a falsy value if `a` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, whereas the original `a` expression would evaluate to a falsy value if `a` is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would always evaluate to a truthy value, whereas the original `a` expression would evaluate to a falsy value if `a` is 0.

DONE.
