  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` and `spaces` parameters are not being passed to the original `JSON.stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'\n'` character is being added to the end of the string, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces).replace(/\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is being called on the string returned by `JSON.stringify`, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
