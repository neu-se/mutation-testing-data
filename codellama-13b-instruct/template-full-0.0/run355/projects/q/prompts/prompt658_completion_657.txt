  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with a single element, which is the number 1, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an incorrect number of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with a single element, which is the number 2, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an incorrect number of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with a single element, which is the number 3, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an incorrect number of arguments, which could lead
