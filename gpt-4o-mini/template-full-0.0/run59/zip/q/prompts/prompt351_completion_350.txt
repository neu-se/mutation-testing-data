Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to `makeStackTraceLong`, which may lead to incorrect stack trace information being generated, potentially obscuring the original source of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the expected `exception` would mean that `makeStackTraceLong` receives no error information, which could lead to a failure in generating a meaningful stack trace for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, exception
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` as the first argument may cause `makeStackTraceLong` to behave differently, depending on its implementation, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in stack trace generation.

DONE.
