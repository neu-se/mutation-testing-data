  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this['im']` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while the new code fragment checks if `this['im']` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this['im']` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while the new code fragment checks if `this['im']` is equal to `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this['im']` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while the new code fragment checks if `this['im']` is equal to `Infinity`.
