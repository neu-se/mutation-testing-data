  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This change will cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, rather than the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This change will cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, and the value `null` to the `key` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key, value]
```
This change will cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, and the value of the `value` argument to the `key` property.

DONE.
