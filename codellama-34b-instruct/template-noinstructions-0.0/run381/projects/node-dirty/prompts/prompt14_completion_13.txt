  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be added to the list of callbacks for the key, but it would not be called when the key is written to the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be added to the beginning of the list of callbacks for the key, but it would not be called when the key is written to the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, 0, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be added to the beginning of the list of callbacks for the key, but it would not be called when the key is written to the database.

DONE.
