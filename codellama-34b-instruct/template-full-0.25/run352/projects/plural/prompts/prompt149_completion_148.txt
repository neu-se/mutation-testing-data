  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) {
  return num > 1 ? this + 's' : this;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the plural form of the word, regardless of the number passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) {
  return num < 1 ? this + 's' : this;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the singular form of the word, regardless of the number passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(num) {
  return num === 1 ? this + 's' : this;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the plural form of the word if the number is not equal to 1, regardless of the actual number passed in.

DONE.
