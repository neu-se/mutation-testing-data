  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a class, whereas the `typeof` operator checks the data type of a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method returns a string representation of an object, whereas the `typeof` operator checks the data type of a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method returns the primitive value of an object, whereas the `typeof` operator checks the data type of a variable.

DONE.
