  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` takes a single argument, which is the error object or value with which to reject the promise. Passing `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` as an argument to `reject` would result in a `TypeError` because it would be trying to call the resolver function as if it were an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` takes a single argument, which is the value with which to resolve the promise. Passing `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` as an argument to `resolve` would result in a `TypeError` because it would be trying to call the resolver function as if it were a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
