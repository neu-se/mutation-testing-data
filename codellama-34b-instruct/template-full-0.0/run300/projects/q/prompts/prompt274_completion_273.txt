  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, while `error` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.stack` is a string, while `error` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.name` is a string, while `error` is an object.

DONE.
