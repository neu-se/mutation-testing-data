  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace("https", "http")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `url` variable as-is, while this replacement would modify the URL to use the `http` protocol instead of `https`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code includes the `www.` subdomain in the URL, while this replacement would remove it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace("electron-window-manager", "electron-window-manager-buggy")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `electron-window-manager` package name, while this replacement would use a different package name.

DONE.
