  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called without arguments instead of being applied to the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise,args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the `promise` object as its context instead of the `descriptor` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the `promise` object as its context and the `args` array as its arguments, instead of being applied to the `descriptor` object and the `args` array.

DONE.
