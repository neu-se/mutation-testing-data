  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete()` would delete the entire line, whereas the original code fragment only deleted the first character of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = 'New line'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'New line'` is a string, not a `Delta` object, and assigning it to `line` would cause `eachLine` to iterate over each character in the string rather than each line in the `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain(1)` would retain the first character of the line, rather than deleting it as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
