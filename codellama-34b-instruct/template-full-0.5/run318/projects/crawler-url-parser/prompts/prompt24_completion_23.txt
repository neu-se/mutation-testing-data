  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^#]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a `#` at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches any character except for a `#` at any position in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*[^#]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a `#` at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches any character except for a `#` at any position in the string, and also requires that the last character of the string is not a `#`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^#]*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character except for a `#` at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches any character except for a `#` at any position in the string, and also uses the `g` flag to perform
