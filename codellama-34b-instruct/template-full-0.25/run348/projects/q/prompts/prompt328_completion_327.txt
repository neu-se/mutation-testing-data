  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, whereas the original code would have resolved with the value returned by the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with the string "Something went wrong", whereas the original code would have resolved with the value returned by the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with the string "Something went wrong", whereas the original code would have resolved with the value returned by the `then` method.
