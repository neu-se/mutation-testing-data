 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method checks if `lastOp` is an object, and if so, it proceeds to compare the attributes and perform certain operations. By replacing `newOp` with `null`, the `typeof lastOp` check will pass, but the subsequent checks will fail, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method checks if `lastOp` is an object, and if so, it proceeds to compare the attributes and perform certain operations. By replacing `newOp` with an empty object `{}`, the `typeof lastOp` check will pass, but the `isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)` check will fail, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior
