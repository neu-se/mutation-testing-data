  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property of the `z` object is set to `1`, which would cause the `div` function to always return `Complex.INFINITY`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = b;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property of the `z` object is set to `b`, which would cause the `div` function to always return `Complex.NAN` when `b` is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `c` variable is set to `0`, which would cause the `mul` function to always return `Complex.ZERO` when the `this` object is not equal to `Complex.INFINITY`.

DONE.
