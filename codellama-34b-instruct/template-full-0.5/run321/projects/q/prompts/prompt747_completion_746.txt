  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `promise` object, but the `onProgress` callback would not be passed as an argument to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `promise` object, passing `onProgress` as the third argument. However, the `onProgress` callback would not be called until the promise is settled, which would not happen until after the `then` method has been called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(function () {
    onProgress();
})
```
