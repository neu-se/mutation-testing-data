  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with `set`, which would update the value of the property instead of retrieving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with `delete`, which would delete the property instead of retrieving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be replaced with `post`, which would send a message to the property instead of retrieving it.

DONE.
