  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the call to `reverse()` on the Array returned by `split()`, which would cause the code to iterate over the segments in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the call to `pop()` on the Array, which would cause the code to use the last segment of the path instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the call to `split()` on the path, which would cause the code to use the entire path instead of just the first segment.

DONE.
