  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `deferred.reject` with the `error` argument, while this new code fragment would call it with the `deferred.reject` function itself as an argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `deferred.resolve` with the `value` argument, while this new code fragment would call it with the `deferred.reject` function itself as an argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `deferred.reject` with the `error` argument, while this new code fragment would call it
