Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.pathname !== '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only remove the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true and the pathname is not just a forward slash, which is the opposite of the original condition that checks if the pathname is exactly a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname === '/' || urlObj.hash !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the trailing slash when the pathname is a forward slash or when there is a hash present, which is different from the original condition that removes the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is true or the pathname is a forward slash and there is no hash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!options.removeTrailingSlash && urlObj.pathname === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it only removes the trailing slash when `removeTrailingSlash` is false and the pathname is exactly a forward slash, which is the opposite of the original condition that removes the trailing slash when `removeTrailing
