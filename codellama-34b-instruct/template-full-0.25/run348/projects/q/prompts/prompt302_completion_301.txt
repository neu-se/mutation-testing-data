  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment performs an addition operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment performs a multiplication operation.

DONE.
