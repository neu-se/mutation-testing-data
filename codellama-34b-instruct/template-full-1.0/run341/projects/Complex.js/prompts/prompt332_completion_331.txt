  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `b === 1` checks if `b` is exactly equal to 1, while `b >= 1` checks if `b` is greater than or equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `b === 1` checks if `b` is exactly equal to 1, while `b !== 1` checks if `b` is not exactly equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b % 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code `b === 1` checks if `b` is exactly equal to 1, while `b % 1 === 0` checks if `b` is a multiple of 1.

DONE.
