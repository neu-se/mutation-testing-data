  
Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder would be incremented by one.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder would be multiplied by two.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the placeholder would be added to a random number.
