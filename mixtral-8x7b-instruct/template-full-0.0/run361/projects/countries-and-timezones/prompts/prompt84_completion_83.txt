 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'id'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the country with the given id instead of the actual country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the memoized country object directly, bypassing the `deliverCountry` function which handles deprecation and other possible future modifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object for the timezone, instead of the actual timezone object or null if it doesn't exist.

DONE.
