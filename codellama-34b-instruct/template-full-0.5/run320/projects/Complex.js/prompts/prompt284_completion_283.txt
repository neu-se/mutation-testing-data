  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and the `Math.cos` function would be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is a different expression than `a`, and the `Math.cos` function would be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a + b)` is a different expression than `Math.cos(a)`, and the `Math.cos` function would be called with a different argument, potentially returning a different result.

DONE.
