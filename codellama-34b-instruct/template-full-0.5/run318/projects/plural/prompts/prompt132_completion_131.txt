  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string representing the type of a variable, whereas `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object, whereas `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.toLowerCase()` is a method that returns a string with all characters in lower case, whereas `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

DONE.
