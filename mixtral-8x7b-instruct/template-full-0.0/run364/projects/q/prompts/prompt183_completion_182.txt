 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt1` is checked for truthiness later in the function, and `null` is a falsy value. The original `attempt1` variable would always be truthy unless it was `undefined`, but replacing it with `null` could cause the following code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt1` is checked for truthiness later in the function, and `0` is a falsy value. The original `attempt1` variable would always be truthy unless it was `undefined`, but replacing it with `0` could cause the following code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt1` is checked for truthiness later in the function, and an empty string is a falsy value. The original `attempt
