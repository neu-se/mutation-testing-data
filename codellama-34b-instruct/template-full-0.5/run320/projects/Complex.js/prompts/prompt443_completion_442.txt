  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(10)` is 10, which is not the same as `10`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil(10)` is 11, which is not the same as `10`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round(10)` is 10, which is the same as `10`.

DONE.
