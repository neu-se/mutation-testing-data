  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream('file.txt')
```
This would result in the entire file being written to a fixed file name "file.txt", regardless of the `dest` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest.toString())
```
This would result in the file being written to a file named after the `toString()` representation of the `dest` object, rather than its filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pipe(dest.buffer)
```
This would result in the file being written to a buffer rather than a file, which would likely cause issues with file size limits or the ability to read the file contents after it is written.

DONE.
