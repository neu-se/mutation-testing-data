  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the larger of the two lengths, potentially resulting in a different number of iterations and a different final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would choose the absolute difference between the two lengths, potentially resulting in a different number of iterations and a different final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(thisIter.peekLength() / otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round up the ratio of the two lengths, potentially resulting in a different number of iterations and a different final result.

DONE.
