  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value of `sin(1)`, regardless of the input value of `φ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value of `cos(1)`, regardless of the input value of `φ2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value of `tan(1)`, regardless of the input value of `φ2`.

DONE.
