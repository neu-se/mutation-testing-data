  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.previous(index)` would move the iterator to the previous position instead of the current position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(index)` would move the iterator to the next position instead of the current position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.index()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.index()` would return the current position of the iterator instead of moving it to a new position.

DONE.
