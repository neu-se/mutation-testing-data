  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[0]` is a different value than `operands[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string, and `operands[1]` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + 1` is the sum of 1 and 1, and `operands[1]` is a different value.

DONE.
