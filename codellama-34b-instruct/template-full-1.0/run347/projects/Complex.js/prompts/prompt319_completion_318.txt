  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` calculates the hyperbolic sine, which is a different function from `cosh`, which calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(cosh(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt(cosh(b))` calculates the square root of the hyperbolic cosine, which is a different function from `cosh`, which calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(b)` calculates the hyperbolic tangent, which is a different function from `cosh`, which calculates the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
