  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(Q.slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(Q.slice(arguments, 2))` would slice the arguments starting from the third element, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` slices the arguments starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2, 5)` would slice the arguments starting from the second element and ending at the fifth element, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 2)` slices the arguments starting from the second element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2, -1)` would slice the arguments starting from the second element and ending at the
