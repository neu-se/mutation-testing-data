  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise for `null` instead of a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise for `undefined` instead of a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise for an empty object instead of a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
