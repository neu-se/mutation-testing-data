  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, new Error("Timeout")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object instead of the original error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the message of the original error object instead of the error object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the stack trace of the original error object instead of the error object itself.

DONE.
