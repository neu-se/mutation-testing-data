  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c != '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `c` is not equal to `'-'` it will return `true` instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `false` if `c` is equal to `'-'`, and `true` if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `false` if `c` is equal to `'-'`, and `true` if it is not.

DONE.
