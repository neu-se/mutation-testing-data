 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `else once(end)` statement will no longer guarantee that `once` function is called with the correct `end` parameter. If `end` is falsy but not `undefined`, the `once` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function will be called with `null` as the `end` parameter, which might not be expected in the rest of the code. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the code assumes `end` to be a boolean or a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called before the `once` function, potentially causing the stream to continue processing data before the `onEnd` callback is invoked. This could lead to issues with synchronization
