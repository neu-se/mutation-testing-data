  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the difference is less than 0. This would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a negative value, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the difference is equal to 0. This would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a value of 0, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft >= 0
