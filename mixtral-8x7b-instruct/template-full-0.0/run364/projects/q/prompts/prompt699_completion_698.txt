 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Array.prototype.slice` with `Array.prototype.call` to create a shallow copy of the arguments, instead of using the `array_slice` function. This might cause issues if the `array_slice` function has specific behavior not present in the native `Array.prototype.slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method from an empty array instead of using the `Array.prototype.slice` method. This might cause issues if the `slice` method on an empty array has different behavior from the one on `Array.prototype`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `slice` method on
