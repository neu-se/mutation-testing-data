  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `module` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an object. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations where `module` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `module` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations where `module` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'undefined' && module !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `module` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not undefined and not null. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations where `module` is not undefined and not null.
