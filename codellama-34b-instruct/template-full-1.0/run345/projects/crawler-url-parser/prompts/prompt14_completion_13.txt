  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split;
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method to split a string into an array, while `replace` is a method to replace a portion of a string with another string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substr;
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` is a method to extract a substring from a string, while `replace` is a method to replace a portion of a string with another string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match;
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method to search for a match between a regular expression and a string, while `replace` is a method to replace a portion of a string with another string.

DONE.
