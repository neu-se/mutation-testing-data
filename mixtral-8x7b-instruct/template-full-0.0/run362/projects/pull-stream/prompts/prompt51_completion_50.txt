 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new value returned by the function would be the numeric sum of the `s` variable and 1, instead of the original value of the `s` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return a string indicating the type of the `s` variable, instead of the original value of the `s` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== s
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, since the expression `s !== s` is never true.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in catching potential issues in the code. If none of the tests fail, it may indicate that the tests are not comprehensive enough and could be improved.

DONE.
