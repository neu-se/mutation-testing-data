  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(thisIter.peekType() === 'insert') && (thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft)`, which would always be `false` if `thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ||
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(thisIter.peekType() === 'insert') || (thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft)`, which would always be `true` if `thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'` is `true
