  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` is a function that returns the next value in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` is a function that returns the next value in the iterator and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(1)` advances the iterator by one step and returns the next value, while `iter.peek` returns the current value without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek(2)` advances the iterator by two steps and returns the next value, while `iter.peek` returns the current value without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
