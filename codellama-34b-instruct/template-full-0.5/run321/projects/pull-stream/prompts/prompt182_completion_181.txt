  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the wrong order of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort, cb, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is called with the wrong order of arguments.

DONE.
