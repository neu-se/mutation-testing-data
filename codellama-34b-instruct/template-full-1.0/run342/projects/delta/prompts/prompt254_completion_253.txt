  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always skip 5 characters from the input string, regardless of the content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always go backwards 1 character from the input string, regardless of the content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in no change in behavior because it is the same code as the original.

DONE.
