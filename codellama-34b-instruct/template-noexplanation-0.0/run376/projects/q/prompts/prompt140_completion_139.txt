  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the logical NOT operator instead of the negation operator. This change will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as `!p` will always be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original, as it uses the identity operator instead of the negation operator. This change will cause the loop to terminate immediately, as `p` will always be falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && !p
```
This code fragment is a combination of the original and the first option, as it uses the logical AND operator to combine the negation of `p` with `p` itself. This change will cause the loop to continue indefinitely, as `p && !p` will always be falsy.

DONE.
