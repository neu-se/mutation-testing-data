  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `ended` state as an argument, but this replacement code fragment always calls the callback function with `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `ended` state as the first argument and the data as the second argument, but this replacement code fragment always calls the callback function with the `ended` state as the first argument and `null` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `ended` state as the first argument and the data as the second argument, but this replacement code fragment always calls the callback function with `null` as the first argument and the data
