  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different structure, which could potentially break the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different structure, which could potentially break the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have a different structure, which could potentially break the code that uses it.
