  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the `plural` method from the `String` prototype, causing the `plural` function to not be accessible as a method on string objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { return this.toString() + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `plural` method with a new method that always returns the string concatenated with 's', regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function() { return this.toString().replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `plural` method with a new method that removes the 's' from the end of the string, regardless of the input.

DONE.
