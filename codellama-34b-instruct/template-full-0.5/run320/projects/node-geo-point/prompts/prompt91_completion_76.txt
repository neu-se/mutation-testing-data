  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ + 180` would shift the bearing by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ * 2` would double the bearing, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ - 180` would shift the bearing by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
