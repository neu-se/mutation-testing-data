  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all occurrences of "http://" with "https://", which could potentially change the URL and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.slice(0, 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return the first 5 characters of the string, which could potentially change the URL and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("://")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the string into an array of substrings using "://" as the delimiter, and then return the second element of the array, which could potentially change the URL and cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
