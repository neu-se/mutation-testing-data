  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment, which was `a`:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `0`. This would result in different behavior because the method `cos` would return a different value, since `cos(0)` is `1`, not `a`.
```
return new Complex(
  Math.cos(0) * cosh(b),
  -Math.sin(a) * sinh(b));
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `b`. This would result in different behavior because the method `cos` would return a different value, since `cos(b)` is not necessarily equal to `a`.
```
return new Complex(
  Math.cos(b) * cosh(b),
  -Math.sin(a) * sinh(b));
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `a + b`. This would result in different behavior because the method `cos` would return a different
