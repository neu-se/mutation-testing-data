  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to conditionally add a minus sign to the string, while the new code fragment always adds a minus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '' : '-') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the ternary operator to conditionally add a minus sign to the string, while the new code fragment always adds a minus sign.
