  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isInfinite` method, so the code would behave differently for infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the value is a finite number, which is the opposite of the `isInfinite` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the value is not a number, which is different from the `isInfinite` method.

DONE.
