  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the path, which could affect the result of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, 'index.html');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last part of the path with "index.html", which could affect the result of the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the path, which could affect the result of the `gettype` function.

DONE.
