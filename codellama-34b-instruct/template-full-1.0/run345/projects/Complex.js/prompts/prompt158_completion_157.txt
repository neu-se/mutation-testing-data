  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isReal']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isReal` property checks whether the complex number is real, whereas the `isZero` property checks whether the complex number is zero. A complex number with a real component of zero can still have a non-zero imaginary component, so the two tests are not equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method returns the absolute value of the complex number, whereas the `isZero` property checks whether the complex number is equal to zero. A complex number with an absolute value of zero can still have a non-zero imaginary component, so the two tests are not equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property checks whether the complex number is infinite, whereas the `isZero` property checks whether the complex number is zero
