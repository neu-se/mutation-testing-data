  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the functions being passed in as arguments rely on the specific order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument has been added to the end of the list, which could potentially cause issues if the functions being passed in as arguments do not expect this additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument has been added to the end of the list, which could potentially cause issues if the functions being passed in as arguments do not expect this additional argument.

DONE.
