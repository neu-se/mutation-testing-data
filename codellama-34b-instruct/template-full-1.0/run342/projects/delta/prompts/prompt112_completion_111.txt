  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last operation, regardless of whether it is a delete or retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the operation, not the actual value of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always try to insert the value of the operation, regardless of whether it is a delete or retain operation.

DONE.
