  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises[index];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise at the current index instead of the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises[index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise at the next index instead of the resolved value of the current promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises[index * 2];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise at the double the current index instead of the resolved value of the current promise.

DONE.
