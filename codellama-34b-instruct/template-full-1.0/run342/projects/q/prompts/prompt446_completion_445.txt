  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the promise to the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function instead of pushing the promise to the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the promise to the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
