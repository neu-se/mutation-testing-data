  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `b` to the result of `this['im'] * places`, which would change the value of the entire expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `b` from the result of `this['im'] * places`, which would change the value of the entire expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of `this['im'] * places` by `b`, which would change the value of the entire expression.

DONE.
