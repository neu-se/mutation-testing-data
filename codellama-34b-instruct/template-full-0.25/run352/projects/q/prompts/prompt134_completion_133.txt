  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality with `value`, while this replacement code fragment checks for strict equality with `value + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality with `value`, while this replacement code fragment checks for strict equality with `value + Math.random()`, which will never be equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for strict equality with `value`, while this replacement code fragment checks for strict equality with the string representation of `value`.

DONE.
