  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is passed as the first argument to `cb()`, which indicates that the stream has ended normally. However, if `undefined` is passed instead, it could cause the stream to be ended prematurely or result in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is passed as the first argument to `cb()`, which indicates that the stream has ended normally. However, if `false` is passed instead, it could cause the stream to continue reading data even though it has already ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `null` is passed as the first argument to `cb()`, which indicates that the stream has ended normally. However, if `1` is passed instead, it could cause the stream to continue reading data past the end of
