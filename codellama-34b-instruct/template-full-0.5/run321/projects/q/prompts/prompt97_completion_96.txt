  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered, and the code would behave as if the loop was never present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, and the code would behave as if the loop was iterating over a different array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the elements in the array in a different order, and the code would behave as if the loop was iterating over a different array.

DONE.
