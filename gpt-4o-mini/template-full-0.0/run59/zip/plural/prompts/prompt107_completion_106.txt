Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:goggle|scissor|pantie|trouser|billiard)s\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for a limited set of words (goggle, scissor, pantie, trouser, billiard) instead of the full list of tools, clothes, games, illnesses, and misc, potentially missing valid plural forms.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:kudo|premise|shamble|glasse|spectacle|jitter|alm|fece|bowel|sud|entrail|electronic|outskirt|odd|tropic|riche|surrounding|thank|heroic|remain|amend|goggle|scissor|plier|tong|tweezer)s\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes additional words (kudo, premise, etc.) that are not part of the original tools, clothes, games, illnesses, and misc, which could lead to incorrect pluralization for
