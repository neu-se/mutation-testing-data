  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve()` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `resolve()` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(result));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of `reject(result)`, which would be a rejected promise.

DONE.
