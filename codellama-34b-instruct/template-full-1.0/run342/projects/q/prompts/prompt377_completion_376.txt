  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the notify method is called with a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progressed(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the notify method is called with a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value + value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the notify method is called with a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
