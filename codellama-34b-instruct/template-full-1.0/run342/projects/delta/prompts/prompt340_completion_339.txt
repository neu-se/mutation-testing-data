  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    baseIndex, baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `base` Delta from a different index, potentially including a different character or characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `base` Delta from a different index, potentially including more or fewer characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    baseIndex + 1, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the slicing, potentially returning a different substring.

DONE.
