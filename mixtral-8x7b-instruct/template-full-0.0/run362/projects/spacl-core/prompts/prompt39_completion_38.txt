 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the first capturing group will always match an empty string, even if there is no actual capture in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the capturing group will match the length of the captured part instead of the actual content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.split('').join('\\/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the path segments will be treated as literal strings with escaped slashes, breaking the expected behavior of matching path segments.

DONE.
