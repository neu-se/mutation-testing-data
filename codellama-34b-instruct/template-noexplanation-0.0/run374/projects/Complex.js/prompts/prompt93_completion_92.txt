  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === ' '
```
This code fragment checks if the current character is a space, which is not a valid character in a complex number. If the character is a space, the parser will exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === '+'
```
This code fragment checks if the current character is a plus sign, which is not a valid character in a complex number. If the character is a plus sign, the parser will exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || c === 'i'
```
This code fragment checks if the current character is the letter "i", which is a valid character in a complex number. If the character is "i", the parser will not exit.

DONE.
