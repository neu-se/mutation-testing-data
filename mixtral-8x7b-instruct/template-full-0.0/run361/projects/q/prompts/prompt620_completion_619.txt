 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `dispatch` method from the Object prototype, rather than the specific Q promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `dispatch` method of the current object, which might not have the expected behavior if the context changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `dispatch` method from the Math object, which is not related to the Q promise object and would not have the expected behavior.

DONE.
