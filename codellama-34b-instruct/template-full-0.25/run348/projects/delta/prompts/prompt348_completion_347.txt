  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function is now `0`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function is now `null`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function is now `undefined`, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
