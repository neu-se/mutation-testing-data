  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.replace("https", "http")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from HTTPS to HTTP, which could potentially cause issues with the website's security or functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the website's domain name or subdomain structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.replace("electron-window-manager", "electron-window-manager-buggy")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the package name of the URL, which could potentially cause issues with the website's functionality or security.

DONE.
