  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands[2]` would be undefined, causing the progress listener to be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress + 1` would be a different value than `operands[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return progress; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() { return progress; }` would return a different value than `operands[1]` when invoked.

DONE.
