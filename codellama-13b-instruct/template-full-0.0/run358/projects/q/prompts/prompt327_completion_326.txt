  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` returns the entire `args` array, while `args[0]` returns the first element of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` returns the entire `args` array, while `args[1]` returns the second element of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` returns the entire `args` array, while `args[2]` returns the third element of the `args` array.

DONE.
