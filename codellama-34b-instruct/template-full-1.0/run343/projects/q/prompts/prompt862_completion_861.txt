  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` is a function that takes a `ms` parameter to wait for before resolving the promise, whereas `delay` is a function that takes a `timeout` parameter to wait for before resolving the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a deprecated function that has been renamed to `denodeify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfbind` is a deprecated function that has been renamed to `denodeify`.

DONE.
