  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ((this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero()` and `isInfinite()` methods are not defined in the `Complex` class, and will cause errors when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ((this['re'] === 0 && z['re'] === 0) || (this['im'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers are both zero, which is not the same as checking if the complex numbers themselves are zero or infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ((this['abs']() === 0 && z['abs']() === 0) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isIn
