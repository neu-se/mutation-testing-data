 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now check for duplicate values that are twice the original value, instead of checking for duplicate values of the original field.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'field'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now check for duplicate strings with the value 'field', instead of checking for duplicate values of the field variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.field
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now check for duplicate values of the global variable field, instead of checking for duplicate values of the local variable field.

DONE.
