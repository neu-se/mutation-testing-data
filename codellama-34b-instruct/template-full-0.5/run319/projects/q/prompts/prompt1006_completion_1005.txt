  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.prototype` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it with `dispatch()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.constructor` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it with `dispatch()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.toString()` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it with `dispatch()` method.

DONE.
