  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` and `$` anchors match the beginning and end of the string respectively, so the regex would not match "woman".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/woman$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would only match the string "woman" and would not match any other strings that end with "man".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would only match the string "man" and would not match any other strings that end with "man".

DONE.
