 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < Infinity && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue indefinitely, even if there are no more elements in the iterator, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && iter.peek() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the next element using `peek()` instead of `hasNext()`, which may not accurately reflect the end of the iterator. This could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or continue past the end of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && iter.peek().type !== 'delete'
