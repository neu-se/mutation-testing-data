  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" method would be replaced with "throw", which would cause the generator to throw an error instead of continuing to the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" method would be replaced with "return", which would cause the generator to return a value instead of continuing to the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" method would be replaced with "yield", which would cause the generator to yield a value instead of continuing to the next iteration.

DONE.
