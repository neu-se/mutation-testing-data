  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression with the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the BOM character, while this replacement only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression with the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of the BOM character, while this replacement only replaces the first occurrence.
