  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would remove the first element of the `args` array, whereas `args` would leave the array unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(args)` would concatenate the `args` array with itself, resulting in a larger array, whereas `args` would leave the array unchanged.

DONE.
