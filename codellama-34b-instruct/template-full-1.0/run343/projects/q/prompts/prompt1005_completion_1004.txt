  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a built-in JavaScript object, and replacing `Q` with `object` would cause the function to fail when it expects a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.post` is a different function than `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return Q; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would return `Q` instead of calling `Q`.

DONE.
