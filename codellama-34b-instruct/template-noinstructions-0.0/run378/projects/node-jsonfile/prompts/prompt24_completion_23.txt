  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code, and the `|| null` part would cause the `reviver` function to be ignored if it is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver || function(key, value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code, and the `function(key, value) { return value; }` part would cause the `revi
