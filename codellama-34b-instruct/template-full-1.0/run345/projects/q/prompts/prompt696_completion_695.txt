  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `array_slice` would return a slice of the array starting from index 1 instead of the original index 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `array_slice` would return a slice of the array twice the original size instead of the original size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `array_slice` would return a slice of the array starting from index -1 instead of the original index 0.

DONE.
