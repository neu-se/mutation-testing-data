  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array instead of the entire array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `args` array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the `args` array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
