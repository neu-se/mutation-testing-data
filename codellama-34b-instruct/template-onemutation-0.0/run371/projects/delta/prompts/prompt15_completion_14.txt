  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` checks if `a` is null or undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object. If `a` is null or undefined, the `diff` function would return `undefined` instead of an object with the differences between `a` and `b`.

DONE.
