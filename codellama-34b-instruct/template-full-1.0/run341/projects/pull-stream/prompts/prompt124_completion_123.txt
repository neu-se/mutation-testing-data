  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `cb`, meaning the if statement would be flipped and the `end` callback would be called even if `i > max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the resulting value of `cb` to be incremented by 1, which would likely cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the `cb` variable would be undefined and the `if` statement would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
