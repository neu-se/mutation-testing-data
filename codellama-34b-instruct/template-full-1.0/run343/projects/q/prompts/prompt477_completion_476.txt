  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(-1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last reason in the unhandledReasons array, which may not be the one that corresponds to the promise being untracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, at);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the reason at the same index as the promise, which may not be the correct reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, at);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first reason in the unhandledReasons array, which may not be the one that corresponds to the promise being untracked.

DONE.
