  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `Error.throw new Error();`

This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement will cause an exception to be thrown immediately, instead of returning a promise that rejects with the given error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `null;`

This would result in different behavior because the `null` value will be returned immediately, instead of waiting for the promise to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `promise.cancel();`

This would result in different behavior because the `cancel` method will cancel the promise, causing it to reject with an appropriate error message.

DONE.
