  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is a weaker comparison than `===`, and can produce unexpected results when comparing values of different types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is never equal to `false`, so the resulting value would always be `end` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy, so the resulting value would always be `null` instead of `end`.

DONE.
