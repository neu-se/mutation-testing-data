  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` parameter is not being parsed with the `result_normalize_options` object, which could lead to different URL normalization results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method is being called with different arguments, which could lead to different URL parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method is being called with different arguments, which could lead to different URL parsing results.

DONE.
