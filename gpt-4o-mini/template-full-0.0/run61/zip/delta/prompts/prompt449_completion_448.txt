Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is specifically `undefined`, which would return `true` for any non-existent property, potentially leading to incorrect type identification when `op.delete` is actually a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is not a string, which would incorrectly classify valid numeric values as not being of type 'delete', thus affecting the logic that determines the operation type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.delete` is greater than zero, which would only return `true` for positive numbers, potentially excluding valid `delete` operations that are zero or negative, leading to incorrect type identification.

DONE.
