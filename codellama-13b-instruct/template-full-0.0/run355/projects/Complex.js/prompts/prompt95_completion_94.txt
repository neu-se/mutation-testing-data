  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the variable c would change the value of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the variable c would change the value of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the variable c would change the value of the expression.

DONE.
