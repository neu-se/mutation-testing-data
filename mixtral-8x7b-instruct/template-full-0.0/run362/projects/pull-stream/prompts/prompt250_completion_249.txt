 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function context, which could affect variable scoping and closure behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { cb }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function with a named function expression, which could affect variable scoping and closure behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the callback in a setTimeout with a delay of 0, which could cause the callback to be executed in a different tick of the event loop, leading to potential race conditions or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
