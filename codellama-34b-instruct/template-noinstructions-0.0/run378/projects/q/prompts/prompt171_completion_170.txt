  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to always return an empty string, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to always return a promise that is rejected with an error that has an empty stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to always return the original stack trace, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to always return a promise that is resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to always return an empty string,
