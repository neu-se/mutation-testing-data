  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the variable `i` instead of incrementing it, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, which could cause the loop to miss certain elements or repeat certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the variable `i` to 0 every time it iterates, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely or not at all, depending on the initial value of `i`.

DONE.
