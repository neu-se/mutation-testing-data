  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is undefined, whereas `row.key` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 1` is not defined, whereas `row.key` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key.trim()` is a trimmed version of `row.key`, whereas `row.key` is the original, untrimmed key.

DONE.
