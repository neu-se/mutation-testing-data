  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `this` context to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the `this` context to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as the `this` context to the `dispatch` method, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently or throw an error.

DONE.
