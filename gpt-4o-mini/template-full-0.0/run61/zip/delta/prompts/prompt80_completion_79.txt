Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assume that `lastOp` is an object, leading to the insertion of `newOp` even when it should not be, potentially corrupting the operations list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `lastOp` is strictly `null`, which would not account for other non-object types (like numbers or strings), causing the logic to fail when `lastOp` is a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `lastOp` as an array, which would be incorrect in the context of the code, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to handle operations that are not arrays.

DONE.
