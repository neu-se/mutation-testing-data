  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` method returns an array of matches, but `search` method returns the position of the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   !spec.match
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original result of the `match` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   spec.split("").filter(x => x === "a").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of times the character "a" appears in the `spec` string, while the original code returns the number of times the character appears in the path.

DONE.
