 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` passes arguments differently than `apply`. `apply` passes arguments as an array, while `call` passes arguments separately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newPromise.promiseDispatch()
