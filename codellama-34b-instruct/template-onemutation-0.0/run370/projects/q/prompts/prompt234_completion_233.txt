  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `resolvedPromise.promise` is a property of that object that refers to the promise itself. By using `resolvedPromise.promise`, the code would be referring to the promise object, rather than the promise's value. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code, depending on how the promise is used.

DONE.
