  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that are not forward slashes, while the new code fragment only matches a specific set of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that are not forward slashes, while the new code fragment only matches any sequence of characters that are not forward slashes and does not have the same specific set of characters as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any sequence of characters that are not forward slashes, while the new code fragment only matches any sequence of characters that are not forward slashes at the end of the string.

DONE.
