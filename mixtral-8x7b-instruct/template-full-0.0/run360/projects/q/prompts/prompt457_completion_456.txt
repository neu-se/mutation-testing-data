 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method would not be able to find the `promise` in the empty array, and the unhandled rejection would not be reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{promise: []}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method would not be able to find the `promise` in the object's array property, and the unhandled rejection would not be reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` method would not be able to find the `promise` in the resolved promise, and the unhandled rejection would not be reported.

DONE.
