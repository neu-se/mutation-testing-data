  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, and would cause a runtime error when trying to use the `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array `[]` would not have any elements to concatenate with the `args` array, and would return an empty array as the result of the `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[1, 2, 3]` array would be concatenated with the `args` array, resulting in a new array that contains the elements of both arrays.

DONE.
