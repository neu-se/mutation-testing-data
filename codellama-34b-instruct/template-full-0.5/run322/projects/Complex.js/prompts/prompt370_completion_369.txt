  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-a` will negate the value of `a`, whereas the original code fragment `a` will not change the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` will increment the value of `a` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `a` will not change the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * b` will multiply the values of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment `a` will not change the value of `a`.

DONE.
