  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is now added to the `b` variable, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now added to the `b` variable, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is now subtracted from the `b` variable, which changes the result of the calculation.

DONE.
