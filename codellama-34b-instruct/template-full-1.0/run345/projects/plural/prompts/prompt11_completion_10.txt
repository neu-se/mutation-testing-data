  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'`, which removes one character from the end of the word and then adds `'ies'`. The proposal would remove two characters from the end of the word and then add `'ies'`, resulting in a different word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'uses' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'`, which adds `'ies'` to the end of the word. The proposal would add `'uses'` to the end of the word, resulting in a different word.
