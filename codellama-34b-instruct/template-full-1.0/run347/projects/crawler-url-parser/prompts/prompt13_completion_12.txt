```
/^https?:\/\//, 'http://'
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace `http` protocol with `https`, which could cause unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//, 'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the URL with a specific domain, which could cause unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.

DONE.
