  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would likely cause an error when trying to access the properties of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method than "apply" and would likely return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply2"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply2" is a different method than "apply" and would likely return a different value.

DONE.
