  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is a property that returns the state of the promise, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.value` is a property that returns the value of the promise, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.reason` is a property that returns the reason for the promise's rejection, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise.

DONE.
