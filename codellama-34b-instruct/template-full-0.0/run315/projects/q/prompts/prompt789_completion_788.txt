  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` if the promise is fulfilled, instead of returning the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(noop, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` if the promise is rejected, instead of returning the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` if the promise is fulfilled or rejected, instead of returning the fulfillment value or rejection reason.

DONE.
