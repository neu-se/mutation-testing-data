  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is checking for the value `NaN`, but `!isNaN` is checking for any value that is not `NaN`, which could include valid values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a global function, while `Number.isNaN` is a method of the `Number` object and can only be used on numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isfinite` is checking for a finite value, but `isNaN` is checking for `NaN`.

DONE.
