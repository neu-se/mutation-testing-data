Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the event emitted from an 'error' event to a 'warning' event, which may not be handled by the error listeners, potentially leading to unhandled errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits an 'info' event instead of an 'error' event, which could mislead the application into treating the situation as a normal informational message rather than a critical error that needs attention.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'critical'
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'critical' event instead of an 'error' event, which may trigger different handling logic in the application, potentially causing it to escalate the issue inappropriately or ignore it altogether.

DONE.
