  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, which is the `thisp` argument that is passed to the `nbind` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the number `1` to the end of the `args` array, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `args` array, which would cause the `nbind` method to be called with the arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
