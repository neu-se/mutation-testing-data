  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
! err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `err` value, so the code would enter the `if` block even if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=== undefined` operator checks if `err` is strictly equal to `undefined`, so the code would enter the `if` block if `err` is not strictly equal to `undefined`, rather than just falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(err, 'err')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `err` has an own property called `'err'`, so the code would enter the `if` block if `err` has such a property, rather than just being truthy or falsy.

DONE.
