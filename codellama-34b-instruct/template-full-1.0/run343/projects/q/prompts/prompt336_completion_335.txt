  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect(somethingElse);
```
This would result in different behavior because `somethingElse` might be a different promise than `promise`, and therefore `inspect()` could potentially return different information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect(anotherPromise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `anotherPromise` is a different promise than `promise`, and therefore `inspect()` could potentially return different information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect(aDifferentPromise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `aDifferentPromise` is a different promise than `promise`, and therefore `inspect()` could potentially return different information.

DONE.
