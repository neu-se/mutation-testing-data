  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` method to return a different result for negative values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` method to return a different result for negative values of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b > 0
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` method to return a different result for negative values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
