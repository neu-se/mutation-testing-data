  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + b` is an expression that adds two variables. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a - b` is an expression that subtracts two variables. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a * b` is an expression that multiplies two variables. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
