  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(x);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called even if `Q(bound).apply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)` throws an error, which could cause the promise to be resolved with an unexpected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error and reject the promise, even if the function was called with a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function () { deferred.reject(new Error("This is a bug")); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an error after a timeout of 0 milliseconds, which could cause the promise to be rejected out of order.

DONE.
