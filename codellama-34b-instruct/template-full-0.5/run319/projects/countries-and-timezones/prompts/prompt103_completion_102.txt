  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev && tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `prev` object to be returned only if `tzs[key]` is truthy, whereas in the original code, the `prev` object would be returned regardless of the value of `tzs[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev || tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `prev` object to be returned if it is truthy, and `tzs[key]` would be returned if `prev` is falsy. In the original code, `prev` would be returned regardless of the value of `tzs[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev ^ tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator would cause the `prev` object to be returned if it is truthy and `tzs[key
