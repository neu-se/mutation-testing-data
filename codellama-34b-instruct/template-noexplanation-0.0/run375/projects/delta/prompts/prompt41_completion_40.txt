  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `Object.keys()` method to get the keys of the `a` object instead of the `attributes` object. This change should not affect the behavior of the `transform()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `Object.values()` method to get the values of the `a` object instead of the `attributes` object. This change should not affect the behavior of the `transform()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses the `Object.entries()` method to get the key-value pairs of the `a` object instead of the `attributes` object. This change should not affect the behavior of the `transform()` function.
