  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas `object_create(Promise.prototype)` creates a new object with the `Promise` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(value)` creates a new promise that is resolved with the value, whereas `object_create(Promise.prototype)` creates a new object with the `Promise` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(reason)` creates a new promise that is rejected with the reason, whereas `object_create(Promise.prototype)` creates a new object with the `Promise` prototype.

DONE.
