  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the truthiness of the `nodeback` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the context of the function call, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a function is a read-only attribute that returns the number of arguments expected by the function, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` if `nodeback.length` is not a positive integer.

DONE.
