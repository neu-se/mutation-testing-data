 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a replacer function as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a replacer function as its second argument, and passing a boolean would not replace any values in the JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects a replacer function as its second argument, and passing an empty function would not replace any values in the JSON string.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior in the code. DONE.
