  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different, and the code that uses it would access a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different, and the code that uses it would access a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being accessed is different, and the code that uses it would behave differently as a result.

DONE.
