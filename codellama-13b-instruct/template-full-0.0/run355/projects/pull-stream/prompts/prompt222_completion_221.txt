  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `map` function to be called with an invalid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `map` function to be called with an invalid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is replaced with `null`, which would cause the `map` function to be called with an invalid argument.

DONE.
