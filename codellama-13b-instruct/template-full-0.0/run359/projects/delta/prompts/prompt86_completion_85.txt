  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `attributes` object is being accessed instead of the `attributes` object itself. This could cause the test to fail if the `attributes` object is not expected to have a `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `attributes` object is being called instead of the `attributes` object itself. This could cause the test to fail if the `attributes` object is not expected to have a `toString()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of the `attributes` object is being accessed instead of the `attributes` object itself. This could cause the test to fail if the `attributes` object is not expected to have a `constructor` property.
