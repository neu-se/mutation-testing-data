  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to `undefined`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is provided or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to `null`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is provided or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the value by 1, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is provided or not.

DONE.
