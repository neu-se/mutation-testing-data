  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `otherIter` does not have a next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `otherIter` has a next element and that element is an insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() && otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if `otherIter` has a next element and that element is a delete operation.

DONE.
