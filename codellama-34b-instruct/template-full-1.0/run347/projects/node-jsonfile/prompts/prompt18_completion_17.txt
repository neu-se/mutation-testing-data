  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is a function that reads a file asynchronously, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a function that reads a file synchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a function that writes a file asynchronously, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a function that reads a file synchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readdir
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readdir` is a function that reads the contents of a directory, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a function that reads a file synchronously.

DONE.
