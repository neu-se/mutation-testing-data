  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is incorrect and should be replaced with the intended word, 'geese'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is incorrect and should be replaced with the intended word, 'geese'. The additional 's' would result in the incorrect plural form, 'gooss'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is incorrect and should be replaced with the intended word, 'geese'. The additional 'es' would result in the incorrect plural form, 'gooses'.

DONE.
