  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with > width) * Math.PI / 180;

This would result in a different calculation for the longitude, due to the use of the width variable instead of the longitude variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with > height) * Math.PI / 180;

This would result in a different calculation for the latitude, due to the use of the height variable instead of the latitude variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with > bearing) * Math.PI / 180;

This would result in a different calculation for the bearing, due to the use of the bearing variable instead of the longitude variable.

DONE.
