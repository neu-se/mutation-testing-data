  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `index` by one, whereas the original code fragment only uses `index` as a read-only variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index + 1` expression evaluates to a different value than `index` when `index` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - 1` expression evaluates to a different value than `index` when `index` is greater than 0.

DONE.
