  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```void 1```
This would result in different behavior because the ```void 1``` operator would return the value 1 instead of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```void 00```
This would result in different behavior because the ```void 00``` operator would return the value 0 instead of undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```void 'test'```
This would result in different behavior because the ```void 'test'``` operator would return the string 'test' instead of undefined.

DONE.
