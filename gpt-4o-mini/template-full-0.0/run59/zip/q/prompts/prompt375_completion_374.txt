Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify(newValue);` to be called only when an exception was thrown, which is the opposite of the original intent where notifications are sent only if no exception occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing `deferred.notify(newValue);` to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not, which changes the logic of when notifications are sent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger `deferred.notify(newValue);` only when `newValue` is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, etc.), which alters the intended behavior of notifying on successful progress.

DONE.
