  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath >= src
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator ">=" would ensure that the target base path is strictly greater than or equal to the source, ensuring that the permission error is not thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath != src
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator "!=" would ensure that the target base path is not equal to the source, ensuring that the permission error is not thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.startsWith(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the "startsWith" method would check if the target base path starts with the source, ensuring that the permission error is not thrown.

DONE.
