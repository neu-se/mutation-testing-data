  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will create a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that will be resolved with the value of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(object)` will create a resolved promise with the value of the `object` variable, whereas `Q` is a promise that will be resolved with the value of the `object` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { return object; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then(function() { return object; })` will create a promise that will be resolved with the value of the `object` variable, whereas `Q` is a promise that will be resolved with the value of the `object` variable.

DONE.
