  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would reject the promise instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would use the promise's own `reject` method instead of the deferred's.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would use the `Q` library's `reject` method instead of the deferred's.
DONE.
