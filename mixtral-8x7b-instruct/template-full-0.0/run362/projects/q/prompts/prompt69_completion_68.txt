 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method would not be called, and no message would be sent through the channel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because messages would be sent to the wrong port (port1 instead of port2), potentially causing unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
channel.port2.close
```
This would result in different behavior because the port would be closed instead of a message being sent, causing any further communication through that port to fail.

DONE.
