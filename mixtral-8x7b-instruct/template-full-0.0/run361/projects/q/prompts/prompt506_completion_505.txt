 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive an empty array as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments array, causing incorrect behavior when applying the promised function or accessing its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive `null` as the `args` parameter instead of the actual arguments array, causing incorrect behavior when applying the promised function or accessing its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would receive an object with a `length` property set to 0 instead of the actual arguments array, causing incorrect behavior when applying the promised function or accessing its properties.

DONE.
