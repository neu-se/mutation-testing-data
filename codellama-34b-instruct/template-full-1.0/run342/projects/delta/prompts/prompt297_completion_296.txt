  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.attributes` would return the attributes of the first operation in the `line`, rather than the attributes of the second operation that contains the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `i > 0` would always be true, since the loop is iterating over the operations in the delta, and `i` will always be greater than 0 if there are more than 0 operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` would always be true, since the loop is iterating over the operations in the other delta, and there will always be more operations to iterate over if the other delta is not empty.

DONE.
