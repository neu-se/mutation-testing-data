  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `pull` function, while `null` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` is not the same as `ref`, and could potentially cause the `pull` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` and `ref[1]` are not the same as `ref`, and could potentially cause the `pull` function to behave differently.

DONE.
