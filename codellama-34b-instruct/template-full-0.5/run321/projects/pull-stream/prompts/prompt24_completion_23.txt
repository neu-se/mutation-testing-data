  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the code would be accessing a different element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of the array element, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the value of the array element by 2, which would change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
