  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` is a function that returns a string, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression that matches the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a string that represents the plural form of the word, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression that matches the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is a function that returns a string, whereas `rule[0]` is a regular expression that matches the word.

DONE.
