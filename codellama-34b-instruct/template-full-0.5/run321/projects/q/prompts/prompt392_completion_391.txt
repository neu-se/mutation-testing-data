  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would change the order of the arguments passed to the `then()` method, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the first element of the `progressed` array, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.concat(["extra"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add an extra element to the `progressed` array, potentially causing the promise to resolve or reject with a different value.

DONE.
