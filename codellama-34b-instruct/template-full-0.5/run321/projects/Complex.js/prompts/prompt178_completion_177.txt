  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) < Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.abs` function to ensure that the divisor is non-zero, whereas the new code fragment does not have this check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of `c` is less than the absolute value of `d`, whereas the new code fragment checks if `c` is less than `d` without considering their magnitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of `c` is greater than the absolute value of `d`, whereas the new code fragment checks if `c` is greater than `d` without considering their magnitudes.

DONE.
