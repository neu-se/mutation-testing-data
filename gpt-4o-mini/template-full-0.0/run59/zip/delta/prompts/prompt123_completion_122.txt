Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= end || !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to stop iterating when `index` is greater than or equal to `end`, or when there are no more operations to iterate over, which could lead to skipping valid operations that should be included in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < start && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the loop to continue as long as `index` is less than `start`, regardless of whether there are more operations to iterate over, potentially leading to an infinite loop if `start` is less than the length of `ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it stops the iteration when `index` reaches `end` or when `index` exceeds the length of `this.ops`, which could lead to missing operations that should be included in the slice if `end` is greater than the length of `ops`.

DONE.
