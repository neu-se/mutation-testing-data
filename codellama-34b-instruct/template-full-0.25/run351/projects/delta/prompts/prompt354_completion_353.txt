  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `baseIndex + length`, which is the correct offset for the next operation. Returning `baseIndex + 1` would cause the `invert` method to skip over the next operation, potentially resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `baseIndex + length`, which is the correct offset for the next operation. Returning `baseIndex + 2` would cause the `invert` method to skip over two operations, potentially resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 3;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `baseIndex + length`, which is the correct offset for the next operation. Returning `baseIndex + 3` would cause the `invert` method to
