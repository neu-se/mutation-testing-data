  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "cello" with a new one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "cello" with a new one that has the same singular and plural forms.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'violino')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace the existing rule for "cello" with a new one that has a different plural form.

DONE.
