  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would always return a resolved promise with the value `1`, regardless of the input value, which is different from the original behavior where the `map` function applied the `prop` function to the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would always return a resolved promise with the value `null`, regardless of the input value, which is different from the original behavior where the `map` function applied the `prop` function to the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would always return a resolved promise with the value `['foo', 'bar', 'baz']`, regardless of the input value, which is different from the original behavior where the `map` function applied the `prop` function to the input value.
