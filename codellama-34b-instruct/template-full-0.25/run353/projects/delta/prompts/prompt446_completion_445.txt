  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be off by one, potentially causing the iterator to return the wrong value or to skip over a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be off by one, potentially causing the iterator to return the wrong value or to skip over a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be doubled, potentially causing the iterator to return the wrong value or to skip over a value.

DONE.
