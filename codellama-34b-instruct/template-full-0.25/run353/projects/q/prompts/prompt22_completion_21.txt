  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `domain` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `domain` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to add the value `1` to the `domain` variable, potentially causing a type error if `domain` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.` operator would attempt to access the `foo` property of the `domain` object, potentially causing a reference error if `domain` does not have a `foo` property.

DONE.
