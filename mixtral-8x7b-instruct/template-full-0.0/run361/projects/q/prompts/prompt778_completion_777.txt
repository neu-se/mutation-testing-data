 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
  return promise;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not called, and the promise object will be returned instead. This could cause issues if the consumer of the `allSettled` method expects an object with `state`, `value`, and `reason` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
  return {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object will be returned instead of the promise's inspection object. This could cause confusion and errors if the consumer of the `allSettled` method relies on the inspection object to determine the state and value/reason of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
  return Q.resolve();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because a resolved promise will be returned instead of the promise's inspection object. This could
