  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function returns `true` for all items, making the `nonUnique` function always return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function returns `true` for all items with a value different from `0`, making the `nonUnique` function always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function returns `true` for all items with a value different from `'foo'`, making the `nonUnique` function always return `true`.

DONE.
