 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.log(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the inverse of the natural logarithm of 2, which is not the same as the original `Math.log` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential value of a number, not the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the base-10 logarithm of a number, not the natural logarithm of a number.

DONE.
