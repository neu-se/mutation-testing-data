Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the `bearing` to a string instead of a number would lead to incorrect calculations in trigonometric functions, which expect numeric input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the `bearing` value would alter the intended angle for the destination calculation, potentially leading to an incorrect destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because using `0` as the bearing would always calculate the destination point directly east of the original coordinate, ignoring the actual bearing value provided.

DONE.
