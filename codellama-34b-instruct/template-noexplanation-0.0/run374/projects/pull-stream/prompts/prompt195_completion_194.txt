  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a `null` value instead of the `aborted` value, which may cause the test to pass even if the `aborted` value is not handled correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an `undefined` value instead of the `aborted` value, which may cause the test to pass even if the `aborted` value is not handled correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"aborted"
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with the string "aborted" instead of the `aborted` value, which may cause the test to pass even if the `aborted` value is not handled correctly.

DONE.
