  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with the `data` argument, which may have a different value than the `test` function was originally called with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with an additional argument, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
