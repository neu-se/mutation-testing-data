  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the square of `a` plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the square of `a` minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the product of `a` and itself.

DONE.
