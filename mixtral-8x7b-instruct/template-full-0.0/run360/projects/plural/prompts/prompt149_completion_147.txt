 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `monkeyPatch` function would not throw an error when adding the `plural` method to the `String` object, but the `unmonkeyPatch` function would not be able to remove it properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `monkeyPatch` function would always add the `plural` method to the `String` object, even if it is already defined, potentially overwriting existing methods or causing conflicts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'plural' in String.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the `monkeyPatch` function would only add the `plural` method to the `String` object if it is not already defined, but the `unmonkeyPatch` function would not be able to remove it properly.

DONE.
