  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an op iterator, so `nextOp.next()` will advance the iterator to the next op, while `nextOp` alone will return the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter` is an op iterator and `peek()` returns the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an op iterator and `peek()` returns the current op.
