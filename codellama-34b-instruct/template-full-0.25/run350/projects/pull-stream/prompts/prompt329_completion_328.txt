  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is not called with the correct argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is called with a different number of arguments.

DONE.
