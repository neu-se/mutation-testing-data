  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names, while `Object.keys(object).length` returns the number of properties in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.values(object).length` returns the number of values in the object.

DONE.
