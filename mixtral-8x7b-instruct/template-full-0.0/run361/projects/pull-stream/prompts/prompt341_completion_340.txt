 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists in the object, but does not set the property if it doesn't exist, potentially causing some items to not be filtered out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the property from the object, causing the filter to potentially allow duplicate items in the future.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the property to false instead of true, causing the filter to potentially allow some items that have been seen before.

DONE.
