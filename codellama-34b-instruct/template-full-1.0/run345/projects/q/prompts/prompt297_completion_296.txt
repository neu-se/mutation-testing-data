  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!y
```
This would result in different behavior because `!y` is the logical inverse of `y`, meaning that it would return the opposite value of `y`. In the context of the code, this would cause `Q(x).join(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to always return a rejected promise, regardless of the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `y.toString()` would return a string representation of the value of `y`, rather than a boolean value. In the context of the code, this would cause `Q(x).join(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to always return a promise that resolves to a string, rather than a promise that resolves to a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `y + 1` would return the result of adding 1 to the
