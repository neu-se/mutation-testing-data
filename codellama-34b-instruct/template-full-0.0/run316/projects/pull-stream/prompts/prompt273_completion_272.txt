  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is a function. This would cause the `nextStream` function to be called even if `stream` is a function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is an array. This would cause the `nextStream` function to be called even if `stream` is an array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is an object with a `length` property, while this replacement checks if the `length` property is greater than 0. This would cause the `next
