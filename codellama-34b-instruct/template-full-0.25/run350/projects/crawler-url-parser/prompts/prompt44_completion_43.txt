  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter, which would cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with a `null` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter, which would cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with an `undefined` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter, which would cause the URL to be parsed differently.

DONE.
