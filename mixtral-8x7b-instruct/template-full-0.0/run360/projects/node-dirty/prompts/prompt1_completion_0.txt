 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.load
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.load` would attempt to call a non-existent method on the `Dirty` class, whereas the original `this._load` was a reference to the valid private method defined later in the class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `this._load()` immediately would execute the method when the instance is created, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment, `this._load`, is a reference to the private method that should be called when a dirty connection is instantiated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super._load
```
This would result in different behavior because `super._load` would attempt to call a method from the parent class (EventEmitter), which does not have a `_load` method. The original code fragment, `this._load`, is a reference to the private
