  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|newword/i
```
This would result in different behavior because a new word "newword" is added to the regex, which would not match with any of the existing words in the original regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|newword/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag is added to the regex, which would make it match all occurrences of the words in the regex, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|newword/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag is removed from the regex, which would make it case-sensitive, so it would not match words
