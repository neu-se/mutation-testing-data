  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the given string is a substring of the `text` property, while the original code uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method checks if the given string is a substring of the `text` property, while the original code uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method checks if the given string is a substring of the `text` property, while the original code uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality.

DONE.
