  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. The `aborted` variable is used to indicate whether the stream has been aborted, and the code checks its value to determine what to do next. If `aborted` is `null`, the code will not behave as expected and may cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a boolean value, while `true` is a boolean value that is always true. The `aborted` variable is used to indicate whether the stream has been aborted, and the code checks its value to determine what to do next. If `aborted` is `true`, the code will behave as if the stream has been aborted, even if it has not. This could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
