  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled()` would always return `true` if the promise is fulfilled, regardless of whether it has been rejected or not. This would cause the test to pass even if the promise is rejected, which would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isPending()` would always return `true` if the promise is pending, regardless of whether it has been fulfilled or rejected. This would cause the
