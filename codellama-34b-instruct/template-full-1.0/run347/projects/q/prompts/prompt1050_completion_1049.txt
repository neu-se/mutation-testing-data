  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are methods of the `Q.defer()` object, and they have different effects on the promise. `resolve` signals that the promise has been fulfilled with a value, while `reject` signals that the promise has been rejected with an error. Using `ends.reject` instead of `ends.resolve` would cause the promise to be rejected, potentially causing an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve` is a different method of the `Q.defer()` object than `ends.resolve`. Using `closed.resolve` would resolve the promise, but it would not have the same effect as using `ends.resolve` since it would resolve a different promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not
