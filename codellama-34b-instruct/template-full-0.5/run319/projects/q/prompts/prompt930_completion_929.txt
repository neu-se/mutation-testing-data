  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will throw an error when called with `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that can be used as a node-style callback, but it is not the same as the original `this` which is a promise.

DONE.
