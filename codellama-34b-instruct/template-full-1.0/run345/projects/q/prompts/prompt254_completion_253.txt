  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.reverse()` would cause the message queue to be reversed when it shouldn't have been.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(0, message.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(0, message.length - 1)` would remove the last item from the message queue, which could be important for the intended use case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(message, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(message, 1)` would remove the first item from the message queue, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
