  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the rule[0] would cause the plural function to return a different result for certain words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[0] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the rule[0] would cause the plural function to return a different result for certain words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the rule[0] would cause the plural function to return a different result for certain words.

DONE.
