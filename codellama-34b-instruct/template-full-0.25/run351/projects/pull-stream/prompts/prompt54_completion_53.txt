  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink` is a function that takes a single argument, but `s.sink(read)` would call the function with two arguments, `read` and `s`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink = read
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink` is a function that takes a single argument, but `s.sink = read` would assign the value of `read` to the `sink` property of `s`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read, s)
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink` is a function that takes a single argument, but `s.sink(read, s)` would call the function with two arguments, `read` and `s`, which would
