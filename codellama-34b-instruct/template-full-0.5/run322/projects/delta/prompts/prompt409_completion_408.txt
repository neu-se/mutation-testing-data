  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable would not be incremented correctly, leading to an incorrect calculation of the transformed position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by the length of the current operation, rather than the correct amount, leading to an incorrect calculation of the transformed position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable would be incremented by the length of the current operation plus one, leading to an incorrect calculation of the transformed position.

DONE.
