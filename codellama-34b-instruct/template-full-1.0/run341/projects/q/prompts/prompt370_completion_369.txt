  Option 1:
```
d.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
    return _fulfilled(value);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a different value than the original implementation.

Option 2:
```
additionalProgressed = function (value) {
    var newValue;
    var threw = false;
    try {
        newValue = _progressed(value);
    } catch (e) {
        threw = true;
        if (Q.onerror) {
            Q.onerror(e);
        } else {
            throw e;
        }
    }
    return newValue;
};
deferred.notify(additionalProgressed(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `additionalProgressed` callback with the value from the original implementation's `progressed` callback.

Option 3:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to notify the given value without calling the `progress
