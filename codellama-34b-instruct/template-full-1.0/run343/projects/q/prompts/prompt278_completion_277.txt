  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code snippet:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a different method than `resolve`. `resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value, while `fulfill` is used to fulfill a promise with a value. In the original code, `resolve` was used to resolve the promise, so the replaced code would now fulfill the promise instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different method than `resolve`. `reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason, while `resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value. In the original code, `resolve` was used to resolve the promise, so the replaced code would now reject the promise instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
