  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFFFE/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\uFEFF/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different escape sequence for the BOM.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the BOM globally, rather than just at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
