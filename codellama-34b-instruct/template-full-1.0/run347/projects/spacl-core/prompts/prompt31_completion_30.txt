  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` character is escaped in the original code fragment, but not in the suggested replacement. This could cause issues with the code's regex matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$` character is used in the original code fragment to reference the end of the string, but not in the suggested replacement. This could cause issues with the code's regex matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` is used to escape the `\` character in the original code fragment, but not in the suggested replacement. This could cause issues with the code's regex matching.

DONE.
