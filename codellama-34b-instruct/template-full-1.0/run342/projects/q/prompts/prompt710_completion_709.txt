  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all({object:object}).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise for an array of promises, so `dispatch` would be called on a promise for an array instead of on the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` would be called on the object instead of on the promise of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("ength")
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to `dispatch` is different, so the behavior of the method would change accordingly.

DONE.
