Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the quantifier from `*` (zero or more) to `+` (one or more), meaning that an empty string would now be considered valid, which was not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[^a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the character class, allowing only invalid characters, which would incorrectly validate paths that contain valid characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality check from `=== null` to `!== null`, meaning that valid paths would now throw an error instead of invalid paths, leading to incorrect validation logic.

DONE.
