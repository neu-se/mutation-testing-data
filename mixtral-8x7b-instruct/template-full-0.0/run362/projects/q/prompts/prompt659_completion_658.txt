 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive only the `name` argument instead of the expected array containing `name` and `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive a single-element array containing the `name` argument instead of the expected array containing all arguments passed to the `invoke` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an empty array instead of the expected array containing all arguments passed to the `invoke` method.

DONE.
