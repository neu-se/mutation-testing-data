Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'output.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the filename to 'output.txt', causing the function to always write to that file instead of the specified `file` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the filename would likely cause an error when trying to write to a non-existent or invalid file path, whereas the original code uses the provided `file` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.bak'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends '.bak' to the original filename, causing the function to write to a different file than intended, which could lead to confusion or data loss if the original file is expected to be overwritten.

DONE.
