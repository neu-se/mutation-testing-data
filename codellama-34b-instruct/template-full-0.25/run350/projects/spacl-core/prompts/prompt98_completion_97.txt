  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "name", regardless of the actual name of the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the uppercase version of the policy name, regardless of the actual name of the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the policy name, regardless of the actual name of the policy.

DONE.
