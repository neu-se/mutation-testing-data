  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a string argument, while this code fragment checks for the presence of any object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a string argument, while this code fragment checks for the presence of a null argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a string argument with length 0, while this code fragment checks for the presence of a string argument with length 1.

DONE.
