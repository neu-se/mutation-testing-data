  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `map === null` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is null or undefined, whereas `!map` would evaluate to `true` only if `map` is falsy (i.e., false, null, undefined, 0, -0, NaN, or "").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `map.length === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is an empty array, whereas `!map` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `map.size === 0` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is an empty map, whereas `!map` would evaluate to `true` if `map` is fals
