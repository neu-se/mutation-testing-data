  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, whereas `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
