  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty = function () { return true; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would always return `true`, even if the property doesn't exist on the object. This would cause the `object_keys` function to return all properties of the object, even if they are inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty = function () { return false; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would always return `false`, even if the property exists on the object. This would cause the `object_keys` function to return no properties of the object, even if they are defined on the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty = function () { return !Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, arguments[0]); };
```
This
