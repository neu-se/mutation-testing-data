  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a countable noun or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last letter of the word, regardless of whether it is a countable noun or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert the word to uppercase, regardless of whether it is a countable noun or not.

DONE.
