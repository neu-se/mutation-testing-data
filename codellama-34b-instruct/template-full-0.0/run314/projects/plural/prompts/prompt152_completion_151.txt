  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the first element of the `rules` array, regardless of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the last element of the `rules` array, regardless of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the last element of the `rules` array, regardless of the input word.

DONE.
