 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve.apply(deferred, [null].concat(nodeArgs))
```
This would result in different behavior because the NodeJS continuation passing function would receive a resolved promise instead of a Node-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(new Error("Manual rejection"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, regardless of the NodeJS function's outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.push(function () { throw new Error("Manual rejection") })
```
This would result in different behavior because the NodeJS function would receive a manual rejection instead of a Node-style callback.

DONE.
