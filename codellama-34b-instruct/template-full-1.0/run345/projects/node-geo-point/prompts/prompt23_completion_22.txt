  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is used instead of `latitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'someOtherProperty'
```
This would result in different behavior because a non-existent property is referred to, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is increased by 1, which would result in a different calculation.

DONE.
