 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.push('dummy')
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a string to the inverted Delta instead of an operation, which can cause issues in further processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
base.push(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation to the base Delta instead of processing it, which can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains the length of the base operation in the inverted Delta instead of inverting the operation, which can cause incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
