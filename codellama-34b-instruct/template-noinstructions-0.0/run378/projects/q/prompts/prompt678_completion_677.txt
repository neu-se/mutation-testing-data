  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the wrong `this` value, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause the method to fail.

DONE.
