  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method "allFulfilled" does not exist on the Promises object, and therefore the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method "allRejected" does not exist on the Promises object, and therefore the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"alwaysFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method "alwaysFulfilled" does not exist on the Promises object, and therefore the code would throw an error.

DONE.
