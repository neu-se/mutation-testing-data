  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'error'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'close'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the `'close'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'data'` instead of `'drain'`, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the `'data'` event.

DONE.
