  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object in non-strict mode, rather than the `thisp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` would refer to the arguments object of the surrounding function, rather than the `arguments` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the `thisp` argument, rather than the original value.

DONE.
