  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space.

DONE.
