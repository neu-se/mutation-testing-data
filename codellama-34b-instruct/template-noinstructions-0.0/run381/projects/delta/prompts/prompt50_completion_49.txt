  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which could lead to incorrect handling of the embed data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that calls this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value for the `embedType` variable, which could lead to incorrect handling of the embed data.

DONE.
