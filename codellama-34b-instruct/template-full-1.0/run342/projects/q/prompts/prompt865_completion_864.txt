  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(<PLACEHOLDER>).delay(timeout)` method would pass `undefined` as the promise value, whereas the original code would pass the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(<PLACEHOLDER>).delay(timeout)` method would pass `null` as the promise value, whereas the original code would pass the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(<PLACEHOLDER>).delay(timeout)` method would pass `void 0` as the promise value, whereas the original code would pass the value of `object`.

DONE.
