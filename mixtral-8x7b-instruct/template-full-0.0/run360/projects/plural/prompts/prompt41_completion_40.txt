 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method instead of the `substr` method to extract the substring, which may have different behavior in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method instead of the `substr` method to extract the substring, which may have different behavior in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `substring` method instead of the `substr` method to extract the substring, which may have different behavior in certain edge cases.

DONE.
