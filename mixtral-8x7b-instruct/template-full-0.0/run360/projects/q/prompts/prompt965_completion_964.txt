 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` passes the context as the first argument, changing the behavior of the `nbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nbind.constructor("return 42")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `nbind` function with a function that always returns 42, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nbind.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` sets the context of the function, but in this case, it is set to `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
