 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` only takes one argument, while `atan2` takes two arguments and considers the sign of both arguments to compute the correct quadrant of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the second argument, which would result in a mirrored value of the angle (180 degrees difference) due to the different quadrant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it performs a division operation, which could lead to a division by zero error if `x` is equal to zero. The original `atan2` function handles this case gracefully by returning a special value (`-Infinity` or `Infinity`) depending on the signs of `x` and `
