  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `s.source` is a function that returns a new source, whereas `s` is a function that returns a new sink. Using `s.source` would cause the function to return a new source, which may not be what the developer intended.

This would result in different behavior because `s.source.sink` is a function that returns a new sink, whereas `s` is a function that returns a new source. Using `s.source.sink` would cause the
