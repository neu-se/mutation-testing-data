  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code adds 'x'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code adds 'es'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return 's' + w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds 's' to the end of the word, while this new code adds 's' to the beginning of the word.

DONE.
