  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `dispatch()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would always resolve the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `dispatch()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay(1000)` would delay the resolution of the promise by 1 second, regardless of the outcome of the `dispatch()` method.

DONE.
