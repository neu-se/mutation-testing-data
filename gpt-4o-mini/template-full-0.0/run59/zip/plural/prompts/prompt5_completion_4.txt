Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, which would not correctly invoke the `toString` method on the object, leading to incorrect type identification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` requires the first argument to be the function context, and without the correct context (the object), it would not return the expected type string, potentially causing the type checks to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because this code creates a bound function that does not have the correct context for `call`, leading to incorrect type identification as it would not be able to properly determine the type of the object passed to it.

DONE.
