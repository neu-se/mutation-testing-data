  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc + seg
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code concatenates the segment and the accumulator, while the new code concatenates the accumulator and the segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => acc.concat(seg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `+` operator to concatenate the segment and the accumulator, while the new code uses the `concat` method to concatenate the accumulator and the segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg.concat(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code concatenates the segment and the accumulator in a specific order, while the new code concatenates the accumulator and the segment in a different order.

DONE.
