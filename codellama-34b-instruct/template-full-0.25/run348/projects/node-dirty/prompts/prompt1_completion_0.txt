  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `_load` method, which is responsible for loading the data from the file system, but the replaced code fragment does not call the `_load` method, so the data will not be loaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Failed to load data'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `_load` method, which is responsible for loading the data from the file system, but the replaced code fragment throws an error, so the data will not be loaded and an error will be thrown instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._data = new Map(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `_load` method, which is responsible for loading the data from the file system, but the replaced code fragment creates a
