  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER Can be replaced with:
```
op == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, whereas the original code snippet uses the `!` operator to check for null or undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for equivalence, whereas the original code snippet uses the `!` operator to check for null or undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, whereas the original code snippet checks for null or undefined values.

DONE.
