  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate one more time than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate one less time than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is multiplied by 2, which would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as the original code.

DONE.
