  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.url` property is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url || options.url === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.url` property is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is either falsy or the string `'undefined'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options.url` property is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is the `null` value.

DONE.
