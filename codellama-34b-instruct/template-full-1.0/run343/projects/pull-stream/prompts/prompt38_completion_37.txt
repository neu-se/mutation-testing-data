  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` property of the `sink` object is not being called, which could cause a bug in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` property of the `read` argument is being called unnecessarily, which could cause a bug in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3], ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], read
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is being changed, which could cause a bug in the program.

DONE.
