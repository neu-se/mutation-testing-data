  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is not a function, it should be `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(callback).napply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `napply` is not a function, it should be `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.fapply(callback, nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` does not have a function `fapply`.

DONE.
