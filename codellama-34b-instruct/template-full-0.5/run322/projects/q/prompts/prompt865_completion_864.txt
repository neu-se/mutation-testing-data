  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects an object as its first argument, but `undefined` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects an object as its first argument, but `null` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects an object as its first argument, but `42` is not an object.

DONE.
