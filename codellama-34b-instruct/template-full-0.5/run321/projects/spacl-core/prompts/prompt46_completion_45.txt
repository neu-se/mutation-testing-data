  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `match`, and would not check if the part matches the pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the part starts with the given pattern, which may not be the same as matching the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the part includes the given pattern, which may not be the same as matching the pattern.

DONE.
