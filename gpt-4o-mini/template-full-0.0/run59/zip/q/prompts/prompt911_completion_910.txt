Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `baseArgs` array, which means that any modifications to the original `baseArgs` array after this point will not be reflected in the copied array, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` modifies the original `baseArgs` array in place and returns a reference to the same array, which means that the order of the arguments passed to the callback will be reversed, leading to incorrect behavior when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.map(arg => arg * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map(arg => arg * 2)` transforms each element of the `baseArgs` array by multiplying it by 2, which changes the actual arguments passed to the callback, potentially causing the callback to behave incorrectly if it expects the original values.

DONE.
