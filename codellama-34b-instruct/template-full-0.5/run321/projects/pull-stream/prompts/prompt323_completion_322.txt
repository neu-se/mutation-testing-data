  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd` is a function, and `onEnd()` would call that function, whereas `onEnd` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd !== null` would check if `onEnd` is not equal to `null`, whereas `onEnd` by itself would simply refer to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd !== undefined` would check if `onEnd` is not equal to `undefined`, whereas `onEnd` by itself would simply refer to the function.

DONE.
