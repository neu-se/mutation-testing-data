  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"^e$|ch$|s$"
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new capture group and changes the quantifier from `*` to `+`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ch|s"
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the word boundary assertion `\b` and the alternation `|` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"^e$|ch$|s$"
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new capture group and changes the quantifier from `*` to `+`.

DONE.
