  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because "void" is not a valid keyword in Python, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if
```
This would result in different behavior because "if" is a keyword in Python that is used for conditional statements, and it would cause a syntax error in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because "return" is a keyword in Python that is used to end a function definition and return a value to the caller, but it would cause a syntax error in this context because it is not inside a function definition.

DONE.
