Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor(b)` will return the largest integer less than or equal to `b`, which can lead to incorrect imaginary parts in the square root calculation, especially when `b` is not an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(b)` will compute the square root of `b`, which is not the intended operation for the imaginary part in the context of calculating the square root of a complex number, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `b` by 2 will incorrectly scale the imaginary part, which can lead to an incorrect calculation of the square root of the complex number, affecting the final output.

DONE.
