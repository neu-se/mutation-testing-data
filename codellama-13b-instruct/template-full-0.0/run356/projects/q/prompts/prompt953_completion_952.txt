  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the new code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors and also calls the `reject` method on the `deferred` object.
