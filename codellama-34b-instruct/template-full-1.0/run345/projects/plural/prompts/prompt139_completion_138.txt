  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends an "s" to the end of the word only if the count is not equal to 1. With this replacement, the "s" is always appended, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that should not be pluralized when the count is 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends an "es" to the end of the word only if the count is not equal to 1 and the word ends with "ch", "s", or "x". With this replacement, the "es" is always appended, which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that should not be pluralized when the count is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substring(0, word.length - 1)
```
This would result
