  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path = "new_path";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property of the `currentUrl` object would be modified, which could potentially affect the output of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol = "http:";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object would be modified, which could potentially affect the output of the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host = "example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property of the `currentUrl` object would be modified, which could potentially affect the output of the `gettype` function.

DONE.
