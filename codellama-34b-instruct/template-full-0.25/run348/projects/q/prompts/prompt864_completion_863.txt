  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a pending promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay(1000)` returns a promise that is resolved after 1 second, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise immediately.

DONE.
