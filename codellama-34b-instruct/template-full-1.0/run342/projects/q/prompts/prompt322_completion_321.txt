  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the callback function, while the original code passed the entire array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to the callback function, while the original code passed the entire array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the entire array of arguments, while the original code resolved the promise with only the first argument.

DONE.
