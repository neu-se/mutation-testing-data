  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b > 0` would always return `true` when `b` is greater than 0, whereas the original code `a <= 0` would return `true` only when `a` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a < 0` would always return `false` when `a` is greater than 0, whereas the original code `a <= 0` would return `true` when `a` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a < 0) { b = -b; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the sign of `b` when `a` is less than 0, whereas the original code would leave `b` unchanged.

DONE.
