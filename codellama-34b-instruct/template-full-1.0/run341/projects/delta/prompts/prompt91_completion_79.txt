  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attributes are an object, but this code fragment checks if the attributes are not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attributes are an object, but this code fragment checks if the attributes are defined (not undefined).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.indexOf(newOp) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the attributes are an object, but this code fragment checks if the newOp is present in the other.ops array.

DONE.
