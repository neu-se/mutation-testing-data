  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation is an insert, while this replacement checks if it is a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation is an insert, while this replacement checks if it is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the peeked operation is less than or equal to the length of the other peeked operation, while this replacement checks if it is greater than.

DONE.
