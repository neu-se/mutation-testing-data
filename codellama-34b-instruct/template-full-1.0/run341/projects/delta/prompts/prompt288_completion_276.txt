  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unlink.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `unlink` is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter` is not a `Delta` object and does not have a `push` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted` is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
