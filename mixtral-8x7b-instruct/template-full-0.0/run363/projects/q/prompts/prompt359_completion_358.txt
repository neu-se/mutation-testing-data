 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback might receive `null` instead of the expected progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would always return a number, even if the original value was not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `value` property of the current object, which might not exist or have the expected value.

DONE.
