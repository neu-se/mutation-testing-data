  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the string "error", while the new code fragment would reject the promise with an Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("different error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the string "error", while the new code fragment would reject the promise with a different Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise with the string "error", while the new code fragment would reject the promise with a TypeError object.

DONE.
