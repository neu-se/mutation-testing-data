  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the result of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(ended)` would be called regardless of the result of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would only be called if the `test` function returned `true`, but the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would be called regardless of the result of `test`.

DONE.
