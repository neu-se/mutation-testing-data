  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the value of `a['r']` would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a complex number with a real part that is 1 greater than the original real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the value of `a['r']` would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a complex number with a real part that is 1 less than the original real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the value of `a['r']` would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a complex number with a real part that is twice the original real part.

DONE.
