  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onRejected, onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected in the opposite order, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
