 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would add 1 to the `data` before returning it, while the original code returns the `data` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would return `null` instead of the actual `data`, potentially causing tests that expect certain data to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.data
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would refer to `this.data` instead of just `data`, potentially causing errors if `this` is not defined or does not have a `data` property.

DONE.
