  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, but if we replace it with `Q.resolve`, the promise would be resolved with the error instead, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error, but if we replace it with `Q.all`, the promise would be resolved with an array of promises, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
