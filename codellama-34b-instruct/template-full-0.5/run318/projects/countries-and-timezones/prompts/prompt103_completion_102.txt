  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only assigns the timezone object to the `prev` object if it is not deprecated, while this modified code would always assign the timezone object, regardless of its deprecation status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[tzs[key].name] = tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the timezone name as the property name for the `prev` object, while this modified code uses the timezone object itself as the property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[tzs[key].name] = tzs[key].name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assigns the timezone object to the `prev` object, while this modified code assigns the timezone name string to the `prev` object.

DONE.
