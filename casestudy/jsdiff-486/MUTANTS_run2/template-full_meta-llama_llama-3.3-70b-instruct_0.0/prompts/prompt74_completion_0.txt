Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a key in the object's prototype chain, not just its own properties, potentially including inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, excluding the object's own properties and potentially including inherited properties or properties that don't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof obj[key] !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists and has a value, rather than just checking if the property exists, potentially excluding properties with undefined values.

DONE.
