 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an empty object, which would not have the `parse` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['parse']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an array with a single element "parse", which is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an arrow function that returns the `parse` function, but does not actually call it.

DONE.
