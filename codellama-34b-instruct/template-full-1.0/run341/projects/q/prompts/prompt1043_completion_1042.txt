  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the object resolved by the `ends.promise` promise, instead of the `head` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unknown"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `unknown` property of the object resolved by the `ends.promise` promise, which is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `get` property of the object resolved by the `ends.promise` promise, which is undefined.

DONE.
