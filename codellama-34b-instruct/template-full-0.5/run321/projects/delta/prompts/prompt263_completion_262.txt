  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different property than `attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different property than `attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `attributes`.

DONE.
