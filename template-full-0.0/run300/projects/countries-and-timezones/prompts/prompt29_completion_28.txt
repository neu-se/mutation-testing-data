  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60 to get the hours, while this code fragment gets the remainder of the offset divided by 60, which would give a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60 to get the hours, while this code fragment multiplies the offset by 60, which would give a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides the offset by 60 to get the hours, while this code fragment adds 60 to the offset, which would give a different result.

DONE.
