  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` could be an object with a `length` property, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null && op.retain.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `op.retain` is an object with a `length` property that is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `op.retain` is an array, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
