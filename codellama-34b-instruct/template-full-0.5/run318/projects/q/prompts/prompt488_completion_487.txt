  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because `resetUnhandledRejections()` is a function that resets the internal state of the promise library, which would cause the test to fail if it relies on that state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is an array that contains unhandled rejections, and setting its length to 0 would cause the test to fail if it relies on the presence of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` is a boolean variable that controls whether unhandled rejections are tracked, and setting it to `false` would cause the test to fail if it relies on the tracking of unhandled rejections.
