  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('select')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all `select` elements on the page, whereas the original code fragment only selects `a` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('.class')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all elements with the class `class`, whereas the original code fragment only selects `a` elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the parent element of the current element, whereas the original code fragment selects the current element.

DONE.
