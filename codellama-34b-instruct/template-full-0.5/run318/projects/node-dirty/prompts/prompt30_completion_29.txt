  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the next key in the map, rather than the current key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key concatenated with the string '1', rather than the current key.

DONE.
