 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk()` function would only be called when there is an error and the `abort` condition is true. In contrast, the original code calls `nextChunk()` when there is no error or the `abort` condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err || abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the first truthy value between `err` and `abort`. In contrast, the original code calls `cb` with the `err` value and passes `abort` as an argument to the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with two arguments: `err` and `abort`. In contrast, the original code calls `cb` with a single argument: `
