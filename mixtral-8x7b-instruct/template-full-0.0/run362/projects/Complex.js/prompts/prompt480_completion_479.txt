 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a comparison operation, which would always evaluate to `false`, making the `isInfinite` method always return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the absolute value of the imaginary part instead of the actual value, potentially misclassifying complex numbers with small imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere instead of checking if it's not at the infinity pole, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to always return `false`.

DONE.
