  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return `undefined` instead of a promise, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return `null` instead of a promise, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return a rejected promise, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to fail.

DONE.
