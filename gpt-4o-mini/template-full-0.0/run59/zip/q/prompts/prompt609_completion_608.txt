Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the operation and arguments, it would reject the promise, leading to an error state instead of a successful resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve the promise with the operation and ignore the arguments, potentially leading to incorrect results when the operation requires those arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` as the first argument, which may not be the intended value, thus altering the expected outcome of the promise resolution.

DONE.
