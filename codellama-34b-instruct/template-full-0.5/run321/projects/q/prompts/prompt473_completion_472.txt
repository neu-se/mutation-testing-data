  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `splice` method to remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the element at the index `atReport`.

DONE.
