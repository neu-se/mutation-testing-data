  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a different method than `done`, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a different method than `done`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` is a different method than `done`, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a timeout error.

DONE.
