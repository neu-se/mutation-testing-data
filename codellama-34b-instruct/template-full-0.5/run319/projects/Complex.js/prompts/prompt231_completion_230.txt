  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `b`, which is a variable that represents the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` is the real part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the imaginary part of the result to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `b`, which is a variable that represents the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b + 1` would cause the imaginary part of the result to be calculated with an offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `b`, which is a variable that represents the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a * b` would cause the imaginary part of the result to be calculated with a different scaling factor.
