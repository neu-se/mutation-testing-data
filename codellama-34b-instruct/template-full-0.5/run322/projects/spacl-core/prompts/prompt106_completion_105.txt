  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, but `matches` is a method that checks if a policy matches a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, but `matches` is a method that checks if a policy matches a path. Additionally, `match` takes a string and a regular expression as arguments, but `matches` takes a path and a query context as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a string matches a regular expression, but `matches` is a method that checks if a policy matches a path. Additionally, `match` takes a string and a regular expression as arguments,
