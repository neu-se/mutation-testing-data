  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will not be called if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will not be called if the promise is rejected with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will not be called if the promise is rejected with a value of `rejected`.

DONE.
