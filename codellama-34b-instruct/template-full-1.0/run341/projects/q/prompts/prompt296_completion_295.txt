  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return x.join(y);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the two values together to form a single string, rather than rejecting the promise if they are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return x[y];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a single character from the string `x` at the position indicated by the number `y`, rather than comparing the two values for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q.resolve(x).then(function(value) {
    return value.join(y);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first resolve the promise `x` and then join the resulting value with the string `y`, rather than comparing the two values for equality.
