  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([1])` would add the number 1 to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` would remove any elements from the `nodeArgs` array that are equal to 1, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the function.

DONE.
