  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function that takes an error as its first argument, and `null` is not an error. In the original code, `done` is called with `end` as its first argument, which could be an error or `null`. By replacing `done` with `done(null)`, we are always calling `done` with `null` as its first argument, which could cause the test to pass even if there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, which is different from the `end` argument that is passed to `done` in the original code. By replacing `done` with `done(new Error())`, we are always calling `done` with a new error object, which could cause the test to fail even if there is no error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
