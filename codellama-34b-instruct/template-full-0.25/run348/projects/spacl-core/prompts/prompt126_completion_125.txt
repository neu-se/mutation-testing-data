  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if its `length` property is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is falsy.

DONE.
