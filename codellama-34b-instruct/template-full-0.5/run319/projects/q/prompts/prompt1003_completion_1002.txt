  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments in reverse order, which could cause unexpected results in the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass one less argument than the original code, which could cause the function to behave differently or produce errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an additional argument to the function, which could cause it to behave differently or produce errors.

DONE.
