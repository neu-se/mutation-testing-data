  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `line.attributes` as the second argument to the `predicate` function, while this modified code fragment passes an empty object `{}` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, line.attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `line.attributes` as the second argument to the `predicate` function, while this modified code fragment passes `line.attributes` again as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `line.attributes` as the second argument to the `predicate` function, while this modified code fragment passes `null` instead.

DONE.
