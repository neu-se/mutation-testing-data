  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which could cause the loop to skip over the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index -1, which would cause the loop to start at the last element in the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element in the array instead of the first.

DONE.
