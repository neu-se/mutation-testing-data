  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
def autofunction(f):
    return f
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function passed to `array_reduce`. Instead of reducing an array of promises, it would reduce a function returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var complement = function (predicate) {
  return function () {
    return !predicate.apply(this, arguments);
  };
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the previous `isPromise` function with a complement of the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var randInt = function (n) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (n + 1));
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the previous `deferred` function with a random integer between 0 and the passed argument.

DONE.
