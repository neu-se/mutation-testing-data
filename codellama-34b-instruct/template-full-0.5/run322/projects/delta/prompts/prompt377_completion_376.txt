  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType()` is a call to that function, which would return the actual type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType === 'insert'` is a comparison that checks if the type of the next operation is 'insert'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` is a function that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekType !== '
