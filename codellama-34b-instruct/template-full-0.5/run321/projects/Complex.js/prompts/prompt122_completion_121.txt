  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() && z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `this.isInfinite()` before checking `z.isInfinite()`, which means that if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite, the original code would return `Complex.NAN`, but the modified code would return `Complex.INFINITY`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isZero() && z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `this.isZero()` before checking `z.isZero()`, which means that if `this` is zero and `z` is not zero, the original code would return `Complex.NAN`, but the modified code would return `Complex.ZERO`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite() || z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different
