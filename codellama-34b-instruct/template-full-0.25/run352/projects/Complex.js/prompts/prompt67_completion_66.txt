  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block when `a` is an array with only one element, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block when `a` is an array with more than two elements, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block when `a` is an array with three elements, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block in that case.

DONE.
