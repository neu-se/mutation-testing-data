  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated` is a different property than `options`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated = true` would set the `deprecated` property to `true`, whereas `options` would leave it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.deprecated = false` would set the `deprecated` property to `false`, whereas `options` would leave it unchanged.

DONE.
