Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for the presence of the next operation, causing the `hasNext` method to incorrectly return `false` when there is at least one operation available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the condition to check for the next operation based on an incremented index, which could lead to skipping the current operation and potentially returning an empty array when there are still operations left.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it causes the `hasNext` method to check the current index instead of the next one, which would incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations available when the current index is at the last operation.

DONE.
