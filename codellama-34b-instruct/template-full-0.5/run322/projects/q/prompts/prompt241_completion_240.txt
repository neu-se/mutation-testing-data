  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` is a different function that checks if a value is an object, whereas `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise. In the context of the code, this would cause the `defer.prototype.makeNodeResolver` function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` is a different function that checks if a value is a function, whereas `isPromise` checks if a value is a promise. In the context of the code, this would cause the `defer.prototype.makeNodeResolver` function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isString
```
This would result in different behavior because `isString` is a different function that checks if a value is a string, whereas `isPromise` checks if a value is a
