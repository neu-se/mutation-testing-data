  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `err` object or the `true` value, while the new code fragment would call it with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `err` object or the `true` value, while the new code fragment would call it with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with the `err` object or the `true` value, while the new code fragment would call it with an empty object.

DONE.
