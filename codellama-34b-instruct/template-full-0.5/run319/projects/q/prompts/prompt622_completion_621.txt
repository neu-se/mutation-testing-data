  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, which could cause issues if the `set` method is expecting a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, "extra argument"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be added to the `set` method, which could cause issues if the method is not designed to handle it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, Q(value)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` would wrap the value in a promise, which could cause issues if the `set` method is not designed to handle promises.

DONE.
