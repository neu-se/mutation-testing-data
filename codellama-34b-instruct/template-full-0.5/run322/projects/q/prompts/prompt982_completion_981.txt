  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(true));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function will now be called with the argument `true` instead of the original `undefined`, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(false));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function will now be called with the argument `false` instead of the original `undefined`, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function will now be called with the argument `null` instead of the original `undefined`, which could cause the function to behave differently and potentially return a different result.
