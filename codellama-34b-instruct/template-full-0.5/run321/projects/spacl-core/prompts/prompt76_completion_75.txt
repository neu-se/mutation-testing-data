  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let rule
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is hoisted, whereas `const` is not, so the `rule` variable would be initialized with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `undefined`, so the `rule` variable would have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is not the same as `undefined`, so the `rule` variable would have a different value.

DONE.
