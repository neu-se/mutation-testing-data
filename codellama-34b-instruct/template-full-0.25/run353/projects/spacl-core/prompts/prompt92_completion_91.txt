  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator over the values in the `policies` map, whereas `for...of` iterates over the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the `policies` map, whereas `for...of` iterates over the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the `policies` map, whereas `for...of` iterates over the keys.

DONE.
