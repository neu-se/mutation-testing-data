 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"<error object>'.stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `stack` property of a string, which would result in `undefined`, instead of an array from splitting the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
e.stack.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the stack trace into an array of characters, instead of an array of lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the stack trace with an array of numbers, which would not provide any useful information about the error's origin.

DONE.
