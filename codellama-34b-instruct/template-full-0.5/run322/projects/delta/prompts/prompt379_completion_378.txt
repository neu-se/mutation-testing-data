  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, while `delta.retain` is a method that retains a certain number of elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` is a method that retains a certain number of elements in an array, while `delta.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` is a method that deletes a certain number of elements from an array, while `delta.push` and `delta.retain` are methods that add or retain elements in an array.

DONE.
