  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by `b` twice, instead of just once in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by `2 * b` instead of `a * a + b * b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch the order of the terms.

DONE.
