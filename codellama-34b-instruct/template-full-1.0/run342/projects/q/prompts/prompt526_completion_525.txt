  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the first argument, rather than the array of arguments, to the `dispatch` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[len(args)-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the last argument, rather than the array of arguments, to the `dispatch` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[len(args)-1][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the first character of the last argument, rather than the array of arguments, to the `dispatch` function.

DONE.
