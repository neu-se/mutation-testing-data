Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only capture the first argument passed to the function instead of all arguments starting from the third, potentially leading to missing necessary parameters when invoking the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the last argument of the `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, which is likely not the intended behavior, as it would ignore all preceding arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `array_slice` function, effectively ignoring all other arguments and altering the expected input for the callback function.

DONE.
