  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array is reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is reversed before being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to interpret the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array is removed before being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

DONE.
