  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would spread the `args` array into a single argument array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, ...args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would spread the `args` array into a variadic list of arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `args` array as the first argument to `value`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
