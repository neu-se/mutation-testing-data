  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `arg` as an index, while the modified code fragment is using `arg + 1` as an index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `arg` as an index, while the modified code fragment is using `arg - 1` as an index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `arg` as an index, while the modified code fragment is using `arg * 2` as an index.

DONE.
