  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(y, x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, whereas `atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, but with the arguments reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that calculates the arctangent of its argument, whereas `atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` is a function that calculates the arctangent of its argument, whereas `atan2` is a function that calculates the arctangent of the ratio
