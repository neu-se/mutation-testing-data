  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag is missing, which means that the code would not check for write permissions on the target folder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` flag is missing, which means that the code would not check for read permissions on the target folder.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` flag is added, which means that the code would also check for execute permissions on the target folder.

DONE.
