  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code uses `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the replacement string uses `$2`, which would refer to the second capture group if it existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code uses `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the replacement string uses `$0`, which would refer to the entire match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is using the wrong capture group. The original code uses `$1` to refer to the first capture group, but the replacement string uses `$1`, which would refer to the same capture group.

DONE.
