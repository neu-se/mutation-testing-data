 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a new rejected promise, instead of rejecting the current deferred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would directly reject the current deferred, bypassing the resolver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it raises an uncaught exception, which would terminate the entire application, instead of just rejecting the current promise.

DONE.
