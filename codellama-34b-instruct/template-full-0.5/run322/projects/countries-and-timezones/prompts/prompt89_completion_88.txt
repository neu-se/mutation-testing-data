  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not always defined in the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not always a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated === 'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property is not always a string value.

DONE.
