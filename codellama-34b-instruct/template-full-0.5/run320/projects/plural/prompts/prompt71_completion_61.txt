  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "cellos" is already defined in the plural rules, and the code would return "cellos" instead of the expected "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "cello" is not defined in the plural rules, and the code would return "cello" instead of the expected "cellos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celle'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "celle" is not defined in the plural rules, and the code would return "celle" instead of the expected "cellos".

DONE.
