  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a test error, which would be caught by the `rejected` callback in the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with a test error, which would be caught by the `rejected` callback in the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Test error");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a test error, which would be caught by the `fulfilled` callback in the `then` method.

DONE.
