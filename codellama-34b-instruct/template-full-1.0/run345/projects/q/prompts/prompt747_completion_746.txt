  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected even if it is not in the rejected state, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable would be set to null, which would cause a runtime error when trying to access the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise.inspect().state)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the state of the promise as the reason, which would cause the code to behave differently than the original.

DONE.
