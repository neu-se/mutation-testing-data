  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the `Math.abs()` function and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being incremented by 1, which would change the result of the `Math.abs()` function and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is being decremented by 1, which would change the result of the `Math.abs()` function and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
