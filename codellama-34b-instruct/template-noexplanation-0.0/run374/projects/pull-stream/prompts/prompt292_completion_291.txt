  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This change will cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `false`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not. This will likely cause some tests to fail, as the function's behavior has been changed in a way that is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This change will cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `true`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not. This will likely cause some tests to fail, as the function's behavior has been changed in a way that is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This change will cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `null`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before or not. This will likely cause some tests to fail, as the function's behavior has been changed in a way that is not intended.

DONE.
