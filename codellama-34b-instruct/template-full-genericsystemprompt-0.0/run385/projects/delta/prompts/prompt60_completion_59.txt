  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while this replacement checks if the argument is a number, which would cause the code to behave differently for non-string arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while this replacement checks if the argument has a length greater than 0, which would cause the code to behave differently for strings with a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, while this replacement checks if the argument has a length of 1, which would cause the code to behave differently for strings with a length of
