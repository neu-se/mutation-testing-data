 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks if the real part is equal to Infinity, instead of checking if the value is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false for positive or negative Infinity, while the original code fragment checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is not finite, which includes NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity, while the original code fragment checks if the value is Infinity.

DONE.
