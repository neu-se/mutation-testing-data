 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*\/*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows trailing slashes in the path specification, which was not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]+$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires at least one character in the path specification, whereas the original code fragment allowed empty path specifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]{1,100}$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the length of the path specification to 100 characters, whereas the original code fragment allowed path specifications of any
