 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always write to the file named 'file' instead of the specified file in the `_writeFile` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always write to the current working directory with the specified filename, instead of the directory of the specified file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend './' to the file path, which might cause issues if the file is not located in the same directory.

DONE.
