  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/")[0].replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the first element of the array returned by `split()`, whereas the original code fragment would replace all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.match
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first match, whereas the original code fragment would return all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.toUpperCase().replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences with uppercase characters, whereas the original code fragment would only replace lowercase characters.

DONE.
