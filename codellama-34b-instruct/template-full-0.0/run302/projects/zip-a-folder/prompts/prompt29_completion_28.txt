  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with an error object instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error instead of resolved with the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with `null` instead of the expected result, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the expected result.

DONE.
