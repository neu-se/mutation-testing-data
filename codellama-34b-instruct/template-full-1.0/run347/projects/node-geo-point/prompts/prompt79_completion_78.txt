  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is being used instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculations to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being increased by 10, which would cause the calculations to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 coordinate.latitude + Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is being increased by 90 degrees, which would cause the calculations to be incorrect.

DONE.
