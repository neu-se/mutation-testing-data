  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for null would cause the code to return a different value when ReturnValue is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for the string "undefined" would cause the code to return a different value when ReturnValue is the string "undefined".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "undefined" && ReturnValue !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for the number 0 would cause the code to return a different value when ReturnValue is the number 0.

DONE.
