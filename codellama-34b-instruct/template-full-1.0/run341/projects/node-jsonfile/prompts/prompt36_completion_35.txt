  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + options
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, whereas `1 + options` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object, whereas `options + {}` is an object concatenated with an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object, whereas `options.length` would return the length of the `options` object.

DONE.
