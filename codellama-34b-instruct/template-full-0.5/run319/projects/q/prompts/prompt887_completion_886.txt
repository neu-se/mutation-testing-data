  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `arguments` would return an array-like object containing all arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `[].slice.call(args, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, but it would also convert `args` to an array first, which could lead to different behavior if `args` is not already an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0, -1)`
