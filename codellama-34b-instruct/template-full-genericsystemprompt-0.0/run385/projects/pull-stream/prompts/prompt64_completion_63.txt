  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` and passes `null` to the `done` callback if it is, while this code fragment checks if `end` is `true` and passes `end` to the `done` callback if it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === false ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` and passes `null` to the `done` callback if it is, while this code fragment checks if `end` is `false` and passes `end` to the `done` callback if it is not.
