  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which would cause the `any` function to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would send a progress notification instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the `any` function to return a pending promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("new error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject("new error")` would reject the promise with a different error message, which would cause the `any` function to return a rejected promise with a different error message.

DONE.
