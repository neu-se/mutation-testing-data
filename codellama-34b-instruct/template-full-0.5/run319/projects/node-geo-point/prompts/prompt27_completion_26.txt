  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value of point2 is used instead of point1, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude + point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude values of both points are added together, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing between two points.

DONE.
