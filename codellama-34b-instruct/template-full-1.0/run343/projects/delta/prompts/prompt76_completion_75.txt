  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting null instead of newOp would alter the expected outcome of the push function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting undefined instead of newOp would modify the behavior of the push function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
These would result in different behavior because inserting newOp.insert instead of newOp would infer newOp. There may be implications for integration.

DONE.
