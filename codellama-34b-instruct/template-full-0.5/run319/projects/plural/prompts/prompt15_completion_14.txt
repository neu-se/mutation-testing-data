  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word, which could be different from the original code fragment that returned the length of the word minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of the word starting from the beginning until the second-to-last character, which could be different from the original code fragment that returned the substring of the word starting from the beginning until the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of the word starting from the second character until the last character, which could be different from the original code fragment that returned the substring of the word starting from the beginning until the last character.

DONE.
