  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 to the result would cause the bearing to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but subtracting 360 from the result would cause the bearing to be negative, which is not a valid bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but multiplying the result by 2 would cause the bearing to be twice the original value, which is not a valid bearing value.

DONE.
