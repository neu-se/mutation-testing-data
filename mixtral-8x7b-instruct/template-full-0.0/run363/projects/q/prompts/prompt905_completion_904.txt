 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current promise object instead of the `nodeArgs` array, causing the `fapply` method to receive an incorrect argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the `fapply` method, which would not include the node arguments or the node resolver, causing incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `nodeArgs` array with the node resolver directly, instead of passing it as a separate argument to `fapply`. This could cause issues if the `fapply` method expects its arguments in a specific format.

DONE.
