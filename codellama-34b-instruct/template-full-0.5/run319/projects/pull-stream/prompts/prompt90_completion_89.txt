  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test(data)` expects a non-null value for `data`, but the mutated code fragment `test(null)` would pass a null value to `test`, which may cause the function to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test(data)` expects a defined value for `data`, but the mutated code fragment `test(undefined)` would pass an undefined value to `test`, which may cause the function to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test(data)` expects a specific value for `data`, but the mutated code fragment `test(data + 1)` would pass a different value to `test`, which may cause the
