  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `z.isInfinite` is a property access expression, while `z['isInfinite']` is a computed property access expression. The former would access the `isInfinite` property directly, while the latter would evaluate the expression `isInfinite` and use its result as the property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z.isInfinite()` is a method call expression, while `z['isInfinite']` is a computed property access expression. The former would call the `isInfinite` method on `z`, while the latter would evaluate the expression `isInfinite` and use its result as the property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isInfinite !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `z.isInfinite !== Infinity` is a
