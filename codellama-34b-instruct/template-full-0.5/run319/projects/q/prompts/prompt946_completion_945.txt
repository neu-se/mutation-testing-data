  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method returns a function that wraps the `deferred.resolve()` method, but the `deferred.resolve()` method is called directly, which would resolve the promise immediately, rather than waiting for the Node.js callback to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method returns a function that wraps the `deferred.resolve()` method, but the `deferred.reject()` method is called directly, which would reject the promise immediately, rather than waiting for the Node.js callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method returns a function that wraps the `deferred.resolve()` method, but the `null` value is
