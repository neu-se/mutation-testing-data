Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` instead of the actual value from `row.val`, which could lead to data loss or incorrect data being stored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, row.val + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value by incrementing it by 1, which could lead to incorrect data being stored if the original value is not a number or if the intention was to store the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, this._data.get(row.key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to the current value associated with `row.key` in `_data`, effectively ignoring the new value from `row.val` and potentially leading to stale data being retained.

DONE.
