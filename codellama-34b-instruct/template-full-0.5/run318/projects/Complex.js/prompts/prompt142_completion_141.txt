  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero, while this code checks if `z` is infinite and `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite, while this code checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is infinite, while this code checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is infinite.

DONE.
