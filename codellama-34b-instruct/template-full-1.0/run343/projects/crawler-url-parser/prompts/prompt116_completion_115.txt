  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".map(function (el) { return el; })"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the map() method to modify the content of the element, whereas the new code fragment is using it to return the element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".map(function (el) { return null; })"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the map() method to modify the content of the element, whereas the new code fragment is using it to return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
".filter(function (el) { return el === 123; })"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the map() method to modify the content of the element, whereas the new code fragment is using it to filter the element based on a specific condition.

DONE.
