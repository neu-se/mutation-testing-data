  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it will give the remainder of the division, rather than the quotient.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 61
```
This would result in different behavior because it will give a slightly different quotient, which could affect the calculation of the offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it will give a negative value if the offset is greater than 60, which could affect the calculation of the offset string.

DONE.
