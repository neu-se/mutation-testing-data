  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = a['re'] + b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return the sum of the real parts of the two complex numbers, rather than the sum of the two complex numbers themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = a['re'] * b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `mul` method to return the product of the real parts of the two complex numbers, rather than the product of the two complex numbers themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] = a['re'] - b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sub` method to return the difference of the real parts of the two complex numbers, rather than the difference of the two complex numbers themselves.

DONE.
