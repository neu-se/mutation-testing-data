  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
args.push
```

This would result in different behavior because `args.unshift` adds specified `nodeArgs` to the beginning of the `args` array, whereas `args.push` adds them to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
nodeArgs.unshift
```

This would result in different behavior because it would add `nodeArgs` to the beginning of `nodeArgs` instead of the beginning of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this.nbind
```

This would result in different behavior because `this.nbind` would return a function that binds `this` to `nbind` instead of adding `nodeArgs` to the beginning of `args`.

DONE.
