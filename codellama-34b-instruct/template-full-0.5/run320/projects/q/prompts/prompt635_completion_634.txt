  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error if `object` is `null`, whereas the original code would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error if `object` is `undefined`, whereas the original code would not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error if `object` is an object with no `promiseDispatch` method, whereas the original code would not throw an error.

DONE.
