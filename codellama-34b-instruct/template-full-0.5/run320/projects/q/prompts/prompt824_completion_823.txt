  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a different error message than the original code, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Different error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly reject the promise with a different error message, rather than allowing the promise to be rejected with the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("Different error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly resolve the promise with a different error message, rather than allowing the promise to be resolved with the original error message.

DONE.
