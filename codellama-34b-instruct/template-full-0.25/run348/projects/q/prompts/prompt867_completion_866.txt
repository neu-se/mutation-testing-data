  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is not called with the correct value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is not called with the correct error, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the wrong error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is not called with the correct value, which would cause the promise to be notified with the wrong value.

DONE.
