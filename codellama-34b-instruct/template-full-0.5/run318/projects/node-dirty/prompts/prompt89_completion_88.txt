  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would return `true` for any falsy value, while `rowStr.length === 0` would only return `true` for an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would return `true` for any falsy value, while `rowStr.length === 1` would only return `true` for a string with a single character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would return `true` for any falsy value, while `rowStr.trim() === ''` would only return `true` for a string with only whitespace characters.

DONE.
