  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `rejected !== null` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `rejected` is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `typeof rejected !== "undefined"` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `rejected` is not called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.caller !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected.caller` is a function, and `rejected.caller !== null` would always evaluate to `true`, even if `rejected` is not called.

DONE.
