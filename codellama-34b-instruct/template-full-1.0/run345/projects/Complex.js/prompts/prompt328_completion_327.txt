  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different operation than `a`, and would produce a different result. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, then `a` would yield `2`, while `a + b` would yield `5`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is a different operation than `a`, and would produce a different result. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, then `a` would yield `2`, while `a - b` would yield `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * a` is a different operation than `a`, and would produce a different result. For example, if `a = 2`, then `a` would yield `2
