  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the value of `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing an infinite loop or an unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over some elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would assign the value of `i` to itself, effectively doing nothing.

DONE.
