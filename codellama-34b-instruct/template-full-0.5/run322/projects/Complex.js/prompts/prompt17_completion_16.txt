  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be using the variable `y` instead of `x`, which could lead to unexpected results if `y` has a different value than `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be adding 1 to the value of `x`, which could affect the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be multiplying `x` by 2, which could affect the result of the calculation.

DONE.
