  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array as its second argument, but `Array.slice.call(arguments)` returns an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array as its second argument, but `arguments.slice()` returns an array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array as its second argument, but `Array.from(arguments)` returns an array.

DONE.
