  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random_string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a country ID as an argument, but the replaced code fragment would pass a random string instead, which would cause the function to return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a country ID as an argument, but the replaced code fragment would pass `undefined` instead, which would cause the function to return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function expects a country ID as an argument, but the replaced code fragment would pass `null` instead, which would cause the function to return `null`.

DONE.
