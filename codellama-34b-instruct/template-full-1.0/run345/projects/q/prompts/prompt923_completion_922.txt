  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used instead of `fapply`, which is a Q-specific method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` is a Q-specific method that allows for promises to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).dispatch("send", [nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a Q-specific method that allows for promises to be returned, and using the "send" message will result in a different execution path.

DONE.
