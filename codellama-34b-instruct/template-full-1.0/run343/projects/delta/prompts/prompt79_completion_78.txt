  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && newOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of the `delete` property on the `lastOp` object, while this replacement code fragment checks for the presence of the `retain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.insert === 'string' && newOp.insert != null

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of the `delete` property on the `lastOp` object, while this replacement code fragment checks for the presence of the `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.attributes === 'object' && newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked for the presence of the `attributes` property on the `lastOp` object, while this replacement code fragment checks for the presence of the `
