  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `next` method without any arguments, which returns the next operation in the iterator. The modified code fragment uses the `next` method with an argument, which returns the next operation in the iterator and advances the iterator by the specified number of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `next` method to retrieve the next operation in the iterator and advance the iterator by one operation. The modified code fragment uses the `peek` method to retrieve the next operation in the iterator without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `next` method to retrieve the next operation in the iterator and advance the iterator by one operation. The modified code fragment uses the `hasNext` method to check
