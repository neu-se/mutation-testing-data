  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` and `apply` are different methods in JavaScript, and `bind` returns a new function with a bound context, while `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply(undefined, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` with an empty array as the second argument would call the function with no arguments, while `apply` with a non-empty array would call the function with the given arguments.

DONE.
