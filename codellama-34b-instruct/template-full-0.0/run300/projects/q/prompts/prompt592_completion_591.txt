  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` when given `null` as an argument, whereas the original code would have returned a resolved promise with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a rejected promise with a `TypeError` when given `undefined` as an argument, whereas the original code would have returned a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a resolved promise with the value `[]` when given an empty array as an argument, whereas the original code would have returned a rejected promise with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
