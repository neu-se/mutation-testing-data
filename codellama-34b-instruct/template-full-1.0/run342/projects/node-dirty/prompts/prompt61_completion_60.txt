  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the stream, whereas `destroy()` would simply shut it down, allowing any remaining data to be flushed before the stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pause()` would temporarily stop the stream, whereas `destroy()` and `end()` would close the stream permanently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.resume()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resume()` would restart the stream if it has been paused, whereas `destroy()` and `end()` would close the stream permanently.

DONE.
