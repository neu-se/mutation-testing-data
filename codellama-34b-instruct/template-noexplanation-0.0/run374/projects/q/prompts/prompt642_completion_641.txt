  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing the elements of `args` starting from the second element, effectively removing the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(args)]
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing the elements of `args` followed by the elements of `args` again, effectively duplicating the contents of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.reverse()]
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing the elements of `args` in reverse order.

DONE.
