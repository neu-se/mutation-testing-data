  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
