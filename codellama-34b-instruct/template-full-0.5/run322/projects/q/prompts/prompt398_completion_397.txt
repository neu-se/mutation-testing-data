  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `thenResolve` method would be called with `null` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `thenResolve` method would be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and the `thenResolve` method would be called with `0` as its argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `0` instead of the original value.

DONE.
