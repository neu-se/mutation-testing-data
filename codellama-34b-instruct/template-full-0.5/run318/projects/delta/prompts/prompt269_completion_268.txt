  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one character instead of chopping the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one character instead of chopping the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(retDelta.length() - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain all but one character instead of chopping the delta.

DONE.
