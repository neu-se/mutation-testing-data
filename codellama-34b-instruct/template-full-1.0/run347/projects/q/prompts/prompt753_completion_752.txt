  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none 
```
This would result in different behavior because "none" is not a function, so it will cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(promise) => {
    throw new Error("Boom!");
} 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function throws an error, causing the promise to reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(promise) => {
    return null;
} 
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns null, which is a falsy value, causing the promise to reject.

DONE.
