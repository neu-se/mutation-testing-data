  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is exactly 2, while the mutated code fragment checks if the length of the array `a` is less than 2. This would cause the code to take a different execution path, potentially leading to different behavior or errors.

DONE.
