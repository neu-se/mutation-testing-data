 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects the `<body>` element instead of the current `<a>` element, and the `attr` method would not be called on the `<a>` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method would not be called, and the `href` attribute of the `<a>` element would not be extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
document.createElement('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new `<a>` element instead of selecting the existing `<a>` element, and the `attr` method would not be called on the correct element.

DONE.
