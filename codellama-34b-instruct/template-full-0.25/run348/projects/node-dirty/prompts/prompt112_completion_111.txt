  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the buffer before reporting the error, which could potentially change the error message and cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the buffer to uppercase before reporting the error, which could potentially change the error message and cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the buffer before reporting the error, which could potentially change the error message and cause the test to fail.
