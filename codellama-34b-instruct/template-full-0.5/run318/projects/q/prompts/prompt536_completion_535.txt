  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value.spread(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method of the `Promise` class, not the `Q` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value.then(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method of the `Promise` class, not the `Q` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value.all().then(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method of the `Promise` class, not the `Q` class, and `then` is a method of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
