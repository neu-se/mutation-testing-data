  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, and the function would return "external" for internal links and "internal" for external links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain == pageurl.domain && linkurl.subdomain == pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only return "internal" for links that have the same domain and subdomain as the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain == pageurl.domain && linkurl.subdomain != pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only return "internal" for links that have the same domain as the page URL but a different subdomain.

DONE.
