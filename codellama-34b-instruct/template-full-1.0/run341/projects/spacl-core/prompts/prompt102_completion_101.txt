  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.map((x) => x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ctx` object directly, whereas this new code fragment uses a mapping function to apply the operation to each element of the `ctx` object, producing a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.filter((x) => x > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ctx` object directly, whereas this new code fragment uses a filtering function to retain only elements of the `ctx` object that satisfy the condition `x > 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ctx` object directly, whereas this new code fragment uses a slicing function to remove the first element of the `ctx` object and return a new array containing the remaining elements.

DONE.
