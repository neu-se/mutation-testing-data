 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qStartingLine = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value assigned to `qStartingLine` is now a hard-coded integer instead of a marker for the line where Q starts. This could cause issues in stack traces and debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qStartingLine = "not a line number";
```
This would result in different behavior because the value assigned to `qStartingLine` is now a string, which would cause errors if it is expected to be a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qStartingLine = new Date().getTime();
```
This would result in different behavior because `qStartingLine` is now a timestamp, which would not provide the same information as a line number in stack traces. This could make debugging more difficult.

DONE.
