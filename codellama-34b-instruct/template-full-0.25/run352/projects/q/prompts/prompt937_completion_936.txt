  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be one element shorter than expected, potentially causing the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be three elements longer than expected, potentially causing the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseArgs` array would be empty, potentially causing the function to fail.

DONE.
