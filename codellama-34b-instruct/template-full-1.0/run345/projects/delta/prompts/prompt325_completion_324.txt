  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length/2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice half of the initial delta, resulting in a different final delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the initial delta in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the initial delta with an additional character, resulting in a different final delta.

DONE.
