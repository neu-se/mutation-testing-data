 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `const` instead of `<PLACEHOLDER>` which is `let` in the original code. This change would make the loop variable `key` a constant, preventing it from being reassigned in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (let key of Object.keys(a)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `let key of` instead of `<PLACEHOLDER>` which is `for (<PLACEHOLDER> in`. This change would iterate over the keys as an array, which could result in different behavior if the keys are not iterated in the same order as the original `for...in` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
for (let key in a) {
  if (a.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
