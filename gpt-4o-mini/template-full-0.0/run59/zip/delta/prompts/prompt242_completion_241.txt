Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect deletions if the lengths of the operations differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length by 1, causing one extra operation to be skipped or deleted, which could lead to data loss or corruption in the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation being processed, which could lead to excessive deletions and potentially remove more content than intended.

DONE.
