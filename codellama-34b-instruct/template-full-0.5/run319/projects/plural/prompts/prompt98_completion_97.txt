  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace('a', 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the letter "a" with "e" in the word, regardless of its position or context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/^a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the letter "a" at the beginning of the word, and not other occurrences of "a" in the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a$/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace the letter "a" at the end of the word, and not other occurrences of "a" in the word.

DONE.
