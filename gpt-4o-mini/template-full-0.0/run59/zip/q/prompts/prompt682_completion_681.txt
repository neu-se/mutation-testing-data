Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the provided object instead of dispatching the "apply" method, potentially bypassing any asynchronous behavior intended by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `null` instead of `void 0`, which may lead to different handling of the `this` context in the dispatched function, affecting how the function behaves when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [undefined, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `undefined` instead of `void 0`, which could lead to inconsistencies in how the function interprets the first argument, potentially causing unexpected results in the function execution.

DONE.
