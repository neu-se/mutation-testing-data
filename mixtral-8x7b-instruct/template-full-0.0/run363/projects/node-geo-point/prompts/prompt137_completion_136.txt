 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.round(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the latitude value to the nearest integer, which may not be the desired behavior in some cases. The original code preserves the precision of the latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1 / this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of the latitude value, which is not the intended functionality of the `adjustPrecision` method. The original code simply adjusts the precision of the longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.longitude * precision
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude value by the precision value instead of adjusting the precision of the longitude value. The original code uses the `toFixed` method to adjust the precision of the longitude value.

DONE.
