 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the sum is reversed, which could lead to different results due to floating-point arithmetic quirks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a) * Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b) * Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the absolute value of the inputs, which could lead to different results when `a` or `b` are negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a + b * b * 1.000001
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a small relative error in the second term of the sum, which could lead to different results due to floating-point arithmetic quirks.

DONE.
