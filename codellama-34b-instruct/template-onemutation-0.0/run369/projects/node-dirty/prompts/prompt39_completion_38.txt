  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality. This means that the new code fragment will return `true` if `fn(key, val)` returns a value that is not strictly equal to `false`, while the original code fragment will only return `true` if `fn(key, val)` returns the boolean value `false`.
