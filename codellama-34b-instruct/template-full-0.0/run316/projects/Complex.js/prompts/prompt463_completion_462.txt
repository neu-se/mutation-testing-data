  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `b` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `b` is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
