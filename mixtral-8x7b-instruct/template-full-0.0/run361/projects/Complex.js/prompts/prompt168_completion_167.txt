 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `z` is a complex number with real and imaginary parts equal to zero, while the original code checks if the denominator is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part of `z` is zero, while the original code checks if either the real or imaginary part of `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `isZero` method from the `z` object, which might not exist or have different behavior than the `isInfinite` method used in the original code.

DONE.
