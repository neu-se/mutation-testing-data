  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator (++) is replaced with the decrement operator (--), causing the loop to iterate one less time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable (i) is replaced with a different variable (j), causing the loop to iterate over a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator (++) is replaced with an addition assignment operator (+=), causing the loop to iterate over every other value.

DONE.
