  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This change will cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return the same value for the longitude, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This change will cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a value for the longitude that is one degree greater than the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This change will cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a value for the longitude that is twice the input value.

DONE.
