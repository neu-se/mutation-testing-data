  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function() { return reject(new Error("Simulated error")); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to always reject with a simulated error, regardless of the actual operation being performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function() { return resolve(new Error("Simulated success")); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to always resolve with a simulated success value, regardless of the actual operation being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function() { return reject(new Error("Simulated error")); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to always reject with a simulated error, regardless of the actual operation being performed.

DONE.
