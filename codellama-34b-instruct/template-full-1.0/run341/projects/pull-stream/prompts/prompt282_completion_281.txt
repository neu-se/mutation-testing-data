  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the data variable is being mapped to a new value, and if that new value is null, the function would return null. In this new version, the function would return a null value regardless of what the data variable is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the data variable is being mapped to a new value, and if that new value is undefined, the function would return undefined. In this new version, the function would return undefined regardless of what the data variable is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the data variable is being mapped to a new value, and if that new value is 0, the function would return 0. In this new version, the function would return 0 regardless of what the data variable is.

DONE.
