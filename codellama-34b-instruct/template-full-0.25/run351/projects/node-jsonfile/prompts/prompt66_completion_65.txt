  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different character (null character instead of byte order mark).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the byte order mark multiple times instead of just once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the byte order mark regardless of case.

DONE.
