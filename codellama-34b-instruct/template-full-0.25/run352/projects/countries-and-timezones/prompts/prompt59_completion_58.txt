  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
