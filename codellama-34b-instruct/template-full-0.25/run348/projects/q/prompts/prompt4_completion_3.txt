  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `definition` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the `bootstrap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `bootstrap` function, rather than the `definition` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an anonymous function as the second argument to the `bootstrap` function, rather than the `definition` function.

DONE.
