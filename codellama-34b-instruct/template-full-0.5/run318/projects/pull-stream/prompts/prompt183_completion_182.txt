  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator will always evaluate to `false` when `i` is equal to `array.length`, whereas the `>=` operator will evaluate to `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator will always evaluate to `true` when `i` is less than `array.length`, whereas the `>=` operator will evaluate to `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator will always evaluate to `true` when `i` is equal to `array.length`, whereas the `>=` operator will evaluate to `false` in that case.

DONE.
