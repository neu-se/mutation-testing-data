  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < len + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run one extra iteration, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to not run at all, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run one extra iteration, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

DONE.
