  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end ? cb(ended) : cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `ended` is true, the callback would be called with `ended` instead of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end ? cb(ended) : cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `ended` is true, the callback would be called with `ended` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end ? cb(null, data) : cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `ended` is true, the callback would be called with `null` instead of `ended`.

DONE.
