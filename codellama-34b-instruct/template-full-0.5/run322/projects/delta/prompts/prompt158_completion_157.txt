  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` advances the iterator to the next operation, which may not be the same as the operation being compared.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the same as the operation being compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the same as the operation being compared.

DONE.
