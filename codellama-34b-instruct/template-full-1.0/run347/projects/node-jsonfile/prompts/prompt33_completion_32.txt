  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, whereas `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an asynchronous function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)`, and it may have different behavior and/or arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fs` is a different variable than `fs`, and it may reference a different object or module.

DONE.
