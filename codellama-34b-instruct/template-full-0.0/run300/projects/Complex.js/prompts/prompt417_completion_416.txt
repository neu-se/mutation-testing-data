  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero()` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] === 0` checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, while `isZero()` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] === 0` checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while `isZero()` checks if the complex number is zero.

DONE.
