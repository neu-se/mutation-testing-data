  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|mistake/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match the word "mistake" which was not matched by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match the word "thesis" twice, which was not matched by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match the word "thesis" and "crisis" twice, which was not matched by the original code fragment.

DONE.
