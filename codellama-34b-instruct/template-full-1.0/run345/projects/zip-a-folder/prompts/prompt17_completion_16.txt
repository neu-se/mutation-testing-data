  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` would create a copy of the substring, which would change the value of `targetBasePath`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.concat(process.cwd())
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` would return a new string that is the result of concatenating `targetBasePath` with the current working directory, which would change the value of `targetBasePath`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` would split the string by `/` and `reverse()` would reverse the order of the resulting array, which would change the value of `targetBasePath`, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
