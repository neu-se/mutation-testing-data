  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail to remove the internal frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace(/\n/g, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all newline characters with spaces, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail to remove the internal frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the stack trace, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to fail to remove the internal frames.

DONE.
