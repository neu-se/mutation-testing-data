  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the key exists in the map, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` sets the value associated with the key to an empty array, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` removes all key-value pairs from the map, whereas `get` returns the value associated with the key.

DONE.
