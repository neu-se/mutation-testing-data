  Sure, I can provide you with three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment. Here are my suggestions:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with a new `Error` object, which would trigger the `error` event instead of the `drain` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null, this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `emit` method to be called with `null` as the first argument, which would not trigger any event, and `this._data.size` as the second argument, which would not be a valid event name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_writeStream` object to
