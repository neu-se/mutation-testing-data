  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `cb` function as an argument, while replacing it with `null` would pass a null value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `cb` function as an argument, while replacing it with an empty function would pass a function that does nothing instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `cb` function as an argument, while replacing it with `undefined` would pass an undefined value instead.

DONE.
