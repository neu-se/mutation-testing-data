  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete !== undefined && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `delete` method of `lastOp` is checked for being a number, but in this new code, only the presence of the `delete` property is checked. This means that the new code would allow for the possibility of `lastOp.delete` being any type of value, not just a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete && newOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `delete` method of `lastOp` is checked for being a number, but in this new code, only the presence of the `delete` property is checked. This means that the new code would allow for the possibility of `lastOp.delete` being any type of value, not just a number. Additionally, this code would also allow for the possibility of `newOp.insert` being any type of value, not just a string.
