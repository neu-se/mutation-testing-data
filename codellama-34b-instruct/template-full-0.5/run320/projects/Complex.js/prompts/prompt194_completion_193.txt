  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `z['re']` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re'] + 1` is a different expression than `z['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `z['re'] * 2` are different expressions.

DONE.
