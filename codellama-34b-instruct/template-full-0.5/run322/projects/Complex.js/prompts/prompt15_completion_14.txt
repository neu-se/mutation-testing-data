  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `x`, which could cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `x`, which could cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `x`, which could cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value.

DONE.
