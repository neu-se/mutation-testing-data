  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not being called on the `handler` object, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` argument is being negated, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to the `transform` method is being reversed, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
