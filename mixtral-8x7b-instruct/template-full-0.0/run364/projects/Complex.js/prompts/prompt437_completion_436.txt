 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use 1 as the power instead of using the `places` variable, which could lead to incorrect rounding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(2, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a base of 2 instead of 10, which would change the way the complex number is rounded and could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places !== undefined ? places : 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the `places` variable if it is defined, otherwise it would use a default value of 10. This could cause issues if the `places` variable is not defined but is expected to have a value, leading to incorrect rounding.

DONE.
