  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), which would introduce randomness into the original code's deterministic behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - Math.sin(a)` would introduce a sign change into the original code's output, which could affect the final result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * Math.cos(a)` would introduce a scaling factor into the original code's output, which could affect the final result of the calculation.

DONE.
