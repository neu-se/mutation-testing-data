  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `directory` method to use the string "src" as the directory path, rather than the actual directory path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `directory` method to use `null` as the directory path, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `directory` method to use `undefined` as the directory path, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
