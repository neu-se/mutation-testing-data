  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) !== 'String' || rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic to check if the first rule is not a string or if the word does not match the rule, which would cause the pluralization to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first rule is a regular expression and if the word matches the regular expression, which would cause the pluralization to behave differently.
