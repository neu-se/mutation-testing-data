  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the `b` variable, which is used in the calculation of the complex number's imaginary component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the complex number's real component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the complex number's real component, and also introduces a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part.

DONE.
