  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case for the word "cello" would fail, as the output of the `plural` function would be "cello" instead of "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', function() { return 'cello' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would return "cello" instead of "cellos" for the word "cello", and the test case would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would return "cello" instead of "cellos" for the word "cello", and the test case would fail.

DONE.
