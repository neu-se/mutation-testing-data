  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the country with the given ID does not exist in the `data.countries` object, rather than checking if the `name` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `name` variable is null, rather than checking if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzMap.current
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `tzMap.current` property is falsy, rather than checking if the `tzMap` object is falsy.

DONE.
