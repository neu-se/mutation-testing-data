  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the comparison condition always true, allowing the `if` statement to execute even when `buffer` is empty, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the comparison condition always false, causing the `if` statement to be skipped even when `buffer` is not empty, which could cause the program to miss important logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer[buffer.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the last character of the buffer to the newline character, rather than the entire string, which could cause the program to behave differently in cases where the last character of the buffer is not a newline.

DONE.
