  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method takes a start index and an end index as arguments, and if the end index is not provided, it will slice the array from the start index to the end of the array. In this case, if the `nearerValue` is an array, `array_slice(1)` will return a new array that contains all the elements of the original array except the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method takes a start index and an end index as arguments, and if the end index is not provided, it will slice the array from the start index to the end of the array. In this case, if the `nearerValue` is an array, `array_slice(0, 1)` will return a new array that contains only the first element of the original array.

Option 3: The PL
