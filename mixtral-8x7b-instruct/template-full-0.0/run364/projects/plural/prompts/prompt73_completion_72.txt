 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cell', 'cells'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize the word "cell" as "cells" instead of "cells".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cellos', 'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize the word "cellos" as "cell" instead of "cellos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cellular', 'cellules'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different rule for pluralizing the word "cellular" than the original code, resulting in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
