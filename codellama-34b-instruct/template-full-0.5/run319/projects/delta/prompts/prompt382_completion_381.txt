  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would retain the entire `otherOp` object, whereas the original code fragment would only retain the length of `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.length` would return the length of the `otherOp` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the length of the `otherOp` object's `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` would return the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object, whereas the original code fragment would return the length of the `otherOp` object's `insert` property.

DONE.
