  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This will cause the logHypot function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, which is Math.log.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This will cause the logHypot function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, which is Math.log.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This will cause the logHypot function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment, which is Math.log.

DONE.
