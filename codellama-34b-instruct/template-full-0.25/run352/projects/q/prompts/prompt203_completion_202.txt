  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be looking for a `#` character in the stack trace, rather than an `@` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be looking for a `%` character in the stack trace, rather than an `@` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"*"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be looking for a `*` character in the stack trace, rather than an `@` character.

DONE.
