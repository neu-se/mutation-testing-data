  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft()` and `trimRight()` will remove different sets of characters from the start and end of the URL, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!url.trimLeft().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the result of the `startsWith` method, so the promise will be rejected if the URL starts with `https:` and resolved otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft().split('://')[1].startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only check if the protocol part of the URL starts with `https`, instead of the entire URL.

DONE.
