  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ct(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function being called from `cb` to `ct`, which is not a defined function in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 null(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function being called from `cb` to `null`, which is not a defined function in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function being called from `cb` to `undefined`, which is not a defined function in the code snippet.

DONE.
