  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload is now `1` instead of `0`, which may affect the behavior of the `MessageChannel` implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage("hello");
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload is now a string instead of a number, which may affect the behavior of the `MessageChannel` implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload is now `null` instead of `0`, which may affect the behavior of the `MessageChannel` implementation.

DONE.
