  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` would return the hostname of the URL, whereas `pageurl` would return the full URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.protocol` would return the protocol of the URL, whereas `pageurl` would return the full URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.pathname` would return the pathname of the URL, whereas `pageurl` would return the full URL.

DONE.
