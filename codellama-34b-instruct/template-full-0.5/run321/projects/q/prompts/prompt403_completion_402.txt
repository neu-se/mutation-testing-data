  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a different method than `thenReject`, and it would not reject the promise as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an exception instead of rejecting the promise, and it would not be handled by the `catch` block as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { return reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason instead of rejecting the promise, and it would not be handled by the `catch` block as intended.

DONE.
