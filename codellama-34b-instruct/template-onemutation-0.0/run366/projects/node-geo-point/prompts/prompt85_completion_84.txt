  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the destination point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point. Using `φ2` instead of `φ1` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the destination point's latitude, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
