  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, as the `source` property of the `source` object would also be the `source` object itself, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, as the `source` property of the `source` object would also be the `source` object itself, causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
