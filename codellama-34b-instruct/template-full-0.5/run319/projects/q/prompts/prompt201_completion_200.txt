  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\t" is a tab character, which would cause the stack trace to be separated by tabs instead of newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because " " is a space character, which would cause the stack trace to be separated by spaces instead of newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because "\\n" is a string that contains a backslash and the letter "n", which would cause the stack trace to be separated by the literal string "\n" instead of newlines.

DONE.
