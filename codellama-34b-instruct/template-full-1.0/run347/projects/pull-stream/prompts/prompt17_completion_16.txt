  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with four arguments, whereas this new code fragment calls it with five arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with four arguments, whereas this new code fragment calls it with five arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `pull` with four arguments, whereas this new code fragment calls it with five arguments, with the last argument being `null` instead of `ref[4]`.

DONE.
