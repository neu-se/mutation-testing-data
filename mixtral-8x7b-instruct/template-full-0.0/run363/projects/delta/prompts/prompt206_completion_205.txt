 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push('dummy')
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a string to the delta instead of an operation object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `pop` method instead of the `push` method, removing the last element from the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the operation to the `ops` array instead of the `delta` object.

DONE.
