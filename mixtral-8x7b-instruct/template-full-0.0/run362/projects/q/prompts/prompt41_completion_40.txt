 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a 1ms delay, which might not be equivalent to the original behavior of invoking `flush` directly. This delay could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the immediate execution of `flush`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
alert('Flushing tasks...')
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an `alert` dialog, which is a synchronous operation that blocks further execution until the user dismisses the dialog. This behavior is different from the original code, which does not display any alerts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.log(global.Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the value of `global.Q` to the console, which might not be equivalent to the original behavior of simply invoking `flush`. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on
