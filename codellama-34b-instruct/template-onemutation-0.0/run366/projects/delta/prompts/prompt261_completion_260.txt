  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to be called on the `AttributeMap` class, which would likely produce a different output than the original code fragment.
