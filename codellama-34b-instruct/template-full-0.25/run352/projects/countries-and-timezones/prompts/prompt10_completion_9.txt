  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `result[country]` property is falsy, while this new code checks if it is explicitly `undefined`. If `result[country]` is `null`, `false`, or an empty string, the original code would consider it falsy and execute the `Object.assign()` statement, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
