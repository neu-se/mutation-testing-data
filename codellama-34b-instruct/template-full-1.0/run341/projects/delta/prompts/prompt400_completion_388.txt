  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an object literal (`{}`) does not have a `length` property, so `Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())` would return `undefined`, causing `while` loop to terminate immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is not an object, so `typeof otherData === 'object' && otherData !== null` would fail, causing the code inside the `if` statement not to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is not a keyword, so `Object.keys("foo")` would throw a `TypeError`, causing the code to crash.

DONE.
