  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a constant, and `i++` is an operation that modifies the value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a constant, and `data * 2` would be a different value than `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a constant, and `data + 1` would be a different value than `data`.

DONE.
