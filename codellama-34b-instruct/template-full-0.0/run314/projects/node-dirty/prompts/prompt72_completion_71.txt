  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a non-zero value, indicating that the database is not empty, even if it actually is. This could cause the application to behave incorrectly if it relies on the `load` event to determine whether the database is empty or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a negative value, which could cause the application to behave incorrectly if it relies on the `load` event to determine the number of items in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a non-numeric value, which could cause the application to behave incorrectly if it relies on the `load` event to determine the number of items in the database.
