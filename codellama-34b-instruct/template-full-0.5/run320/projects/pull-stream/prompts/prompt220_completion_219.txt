This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not the same as `null`, which is a more specific value that indicates the absence of a value.

This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not the same as `null`, which is a more specific value that indicates the absence of a value.

```
This would result in different behavior because `"null"` is a string value in JavaScript, but it
