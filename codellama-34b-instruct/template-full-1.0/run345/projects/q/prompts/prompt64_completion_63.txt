  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is not the same as `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout delay is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
queueMicrotask(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `queueMicrotask` is not a part of the `setImmediate` function.

DONE.
