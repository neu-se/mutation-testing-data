  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `array_slice` would be different, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array of arguments would be different, which would affect the resulting array of arguments.

DONE.
