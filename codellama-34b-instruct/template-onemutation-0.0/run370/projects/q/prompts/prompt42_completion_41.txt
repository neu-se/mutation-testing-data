  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function takes a delay in milliseconds as its first argument, and `1` is a valid delay that would cause the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1 millisecond, whereas the original code fragment `0` would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately.

DONE.
