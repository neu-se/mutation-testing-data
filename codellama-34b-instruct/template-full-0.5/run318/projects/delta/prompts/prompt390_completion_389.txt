  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` expects a number as an argument, but `length` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` is called twice, which could cause an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` would always return 0, which could cause the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
