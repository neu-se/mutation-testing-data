  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is an object, while this new code only checks if it is not null. This would allow non-object values for `attributes` to pass through, which may cause errors later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is an object, while this new code checks if `insert` is a string. This would cause the code to execute differently for operations that involve a `string` insert and an `object` attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is an object, while this new code checks if it is an array. This would cause the code to execute differently for operations that involve an array attributes.
