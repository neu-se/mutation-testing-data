  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize a null value, instead of the actual timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize the same timezone object, instead of creating a new one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(buildTimezone(data, name));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize a new timezone object, instead of the actual one.

DONE.
