  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes in a single argument, while the new code returns a bound function that does not take any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes in a single argument, while the new code returns the result of calling the function with `apply` with the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that takes in a single argument, while the new code returns the result of calling the function with `call` with the current context.

DONE.
