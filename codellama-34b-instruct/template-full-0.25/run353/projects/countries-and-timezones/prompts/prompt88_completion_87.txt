  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a different country than the one expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a different country than the one expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/New_York"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would return a different country than the one expected.

DONE.
