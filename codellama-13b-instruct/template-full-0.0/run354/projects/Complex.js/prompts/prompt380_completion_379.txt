  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `a` is used instead of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `c` is used instead of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `d` is used instead of `b`.

DONE.
