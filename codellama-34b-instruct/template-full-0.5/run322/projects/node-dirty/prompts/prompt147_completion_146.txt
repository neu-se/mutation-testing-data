  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` would always return `undefined`, regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => true;
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `err`.

DONE.
