  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of the type of the rule[0], which would cause the function to always return the word + 's' instead of applying the correct rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, regardless of the type of the rule[0], which would cause the function to always return the word + 's' instead of applying the correct rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true if the type of the rule[0] is a string and the rule[0] is not equal to the word, which would cause the function to apply the correct rule if the type of the rule[0] is a string and the rule[0]
