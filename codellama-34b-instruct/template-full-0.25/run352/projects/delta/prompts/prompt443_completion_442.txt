  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be returned, while `0` would always return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be returned, while `-1` would return the substring starting from the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be returned, while `length + 1` would return a substring that is one character longer than the original.

DONE.
