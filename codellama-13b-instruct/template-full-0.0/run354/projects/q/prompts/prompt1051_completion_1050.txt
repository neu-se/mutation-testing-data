  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is now being assigned to its own `tail` property, which would cause an infinite loop when trying to retrieve the next value from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends` deferred would be resolved with a `null` value, which would cause the `get` method to return `null` instead of the next value in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends` deferred would be resolved with an `undefined` value, which would cause the `get` method to return `undefined` instead of the next value in the queue.

DONE.
