  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different output values for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` have different output values for the same input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` and `Math.sin` are inverse functions of each other, meaning that `Math.asin(Math.sin(x))` would not always equal `x`.

DONE.
