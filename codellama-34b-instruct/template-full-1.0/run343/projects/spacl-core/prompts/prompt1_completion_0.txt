  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[-a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it accepts hyphens in the path, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches zero or more characters, instead of one or more characters, as in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[\-a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches hyphens anywhere in the path, instead of only at the beginning, as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
