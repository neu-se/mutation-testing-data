  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error occurring during the read operation, which would cause the `error` event to be emitted instead of the `load` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end('Test data');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate data being written to the file, which would cause the `data` event to be emitted instead of the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end('Test data', 'utf-8');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate data being written to the file with a specific encoding, which would cause the `data` event to be emitted with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
