  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function is not the same as `Object.prototype.toString`, and would return a number instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array` function is not the same as `Object.prototype.toString`, and would return an array instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `Object.prototype.toString`, and would return `null` instead of a string.

DONE.
