  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `parsedUrl.protocol` was equal to `"http:"` or `"https:"`, but the mutated code fragment would always return `false`, regardless of the protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol !== "http:" && parsedUrl.protocol !== "https:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `parsedUrl.protocol` was equal to `"http:"` or `"https:"`, but the mutated code fragment would check if the `parsedUrl.protocol` was not equal to `"http:"` or `"https:"`, which would result in the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol === "ftp:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `parsedUrl.protocol` was equal to `"http:"` or `"
