  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would be called with a different argument, resulting in a different string being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would be called with a different range, resulting in a different string being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would be called with a different range, resulting in a different string being returned.

DONE.
