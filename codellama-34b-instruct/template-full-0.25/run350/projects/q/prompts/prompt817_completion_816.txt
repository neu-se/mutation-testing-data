  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and not when it is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is progressed, and not when it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is resolved, and not when it is rejected.

DONE.
