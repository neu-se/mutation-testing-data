  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the operation was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `callback` is a function. Using `null` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`, because `null` is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `callback` is a function. Using `undefined` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`, because `undefined` is not a function and cannot be called.
