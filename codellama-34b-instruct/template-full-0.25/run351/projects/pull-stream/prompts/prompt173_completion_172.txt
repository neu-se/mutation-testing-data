  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the given object is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the given object is not an array. This change would cause the function to return a different value for arrays, which could break the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks if the array has a length of 0, while `!Array.isArray(array)` checks if the given object is not an array. This change would cause the function to return a different value for arrays with a length of 0, which could break the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks if the array has a length greater than 0, while
