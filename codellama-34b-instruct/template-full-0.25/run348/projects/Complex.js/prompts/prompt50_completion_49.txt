  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is a different property than `a['abs']`, and it is not clear how the code would handle this difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the absolute value of `a`, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the absolute value of `a` by 2, which could cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
