  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejected function to be called even if it is not defined, potentially causing a crash or incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejected function to be called if it is not defined, potentially causing a crash or incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fulfilled === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fulfilled function to be called instead of the rejected function, potentially causing incorrect result.

DONE.
