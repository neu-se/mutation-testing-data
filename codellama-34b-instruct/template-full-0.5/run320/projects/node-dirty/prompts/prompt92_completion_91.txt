  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause tests to fail if they are checking for the specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Database corrupted')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause tests to fail if they are checking for the specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Database is empty')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause tests to fail if they are checking for the specific error message.

DONE.
