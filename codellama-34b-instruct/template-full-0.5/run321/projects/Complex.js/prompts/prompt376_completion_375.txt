  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the denominator of the fraction, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the numerator of the fraction, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the entire fraction, potentially causing the function to return a different value.

DONE.
