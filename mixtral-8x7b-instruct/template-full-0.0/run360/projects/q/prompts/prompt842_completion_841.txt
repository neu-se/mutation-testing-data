 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(object).timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` wraps an immediate value in a promise, which may cause the timeout to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).delay(ms)
