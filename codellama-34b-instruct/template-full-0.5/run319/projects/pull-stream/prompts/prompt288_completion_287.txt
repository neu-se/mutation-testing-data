  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns both the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while the replaced code fragment only returns `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `mapper` function as-is, while the replaced code fragment passes `data + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `mapper` function on the `data` argument, while the replaced code fragment does.

DONE.
