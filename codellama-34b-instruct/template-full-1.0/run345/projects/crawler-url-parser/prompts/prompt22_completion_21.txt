  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement regex replaces "//" with "https://" instead of "http://", which would cause the code to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//, 'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement regex replaces "//" with "http://www.", which would cause the code to use a different domain than what was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g, 'https://$1.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement regex replaces "//" with "https://$1.com", which would cause the code to use HTTPS and a different domain than what was intended.

DONE.
