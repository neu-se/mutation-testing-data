  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `options` object, whereas `options` refers to the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.noSuchProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.noSuchProperty` would evaluate to `undefined`, whereas `options` would refer to the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options }
```
This would result in different behavior because `{ ...options }` creates a new object with the same properties as `options`, whereas `options` refers to the original object.

DONE.
