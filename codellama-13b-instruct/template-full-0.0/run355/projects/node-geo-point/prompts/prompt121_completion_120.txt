  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing(point1, point2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between two points using the `calculateBearing` method, whereas the original code fragment was using the `calculateBearing` method on the `GeoPoint` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(coordinate, distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point given a coordinate, distance, and bearing using the `calculateDestination` method, whereas the original code fragment was using the `calculateDestination` method on the `GeoPoint` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(coordinate, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert a coordinate to a tile using the `toTile` method, whereas the original code fragment was using the `
