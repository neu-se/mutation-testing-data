  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```0```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the first argument of `array_slice()` is `1`, which indicates that the first element of the `arguments` object should be excluded from the returned slice. By changing this to `0`, all elements of `arguments` would be included in the slice, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER>.length```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the first argument of `array_slice()` is hardcoded to `1`. By using `length`, the slice would include all elements of `arguments`, not just the first element, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```arguments.length```
This would result in different behavior because the original code hardcodes `1` as the first argument of `array_slice()`. By using `arguments.length`, the code would use the length of the `arguments` object as the first
