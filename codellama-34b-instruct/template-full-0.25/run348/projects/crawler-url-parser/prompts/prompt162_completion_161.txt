  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for a difference of 1 in the number of path parts, while this code fragment checks for a difference greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for a difference of 1 in the number of path parts, while this code fragment checks for any difference in the number of path parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for a difference of 1 in the number of path parts, while this code fragment checks for a difference less than 1.

DONE.
