  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a concept in JavaScript that refers to the arguments passed to a function, and `concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with other arrays or strings. By using `nodeArgs.concat(arguments)`, the code would append the arguments passed to the function to the `nodeArgs` array, which is the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.join("|")
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` is a method that creates a new string by concatenating all the elements of an array with a separator string. By using `nodeArgs.join("|")`, the code would create a new string by concatenating all the elements of the `nodeArgs` array with the separator string "|".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(arguments)
```
This would
