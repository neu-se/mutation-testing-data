  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match URLs that start with "http" or "https", and so the code would not remove the protocol from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\w+:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match URLs that start with any protocol, not just "http" or "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\w+:\/\/|:\d{4,}$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would remove the port number from the URL, if it is present.

DONE.
