  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the square of `a` and adding 1, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the square of `a` and subtracting 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the square of `a` and adding 1, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the square of `a` and multiplying it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the square of `a` and adding 1, while the replaced code fragment is calculating the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
