  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.length` is a number, and `base` is an object, so the `in` operator would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, whereas `in` checks if the property is present in the object or its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `base[key] !== undefined` checks if the property is defined, whereas `in` checks if the property is present in the object or its prototype chain.

DONE.
