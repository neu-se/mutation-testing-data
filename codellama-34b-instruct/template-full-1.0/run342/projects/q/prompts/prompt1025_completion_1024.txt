  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q().makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q().makeNodeResolver()` would create a new node resolver, rather than using the one provided as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a null pointer, so the node resolver would not be used at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply(nodeArgs)` would apply the function `nodeArgs` to `Q`, whereas the original code applied the function `Q` to `nodeArgs`. Additionally, `deferred.reject` would be called with the result of the application, rather than being passed as an argument to the application.

DONE.
