  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the argument `a`, which is not the same as the original code that called the `parse` function with the argument `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` together, which is not the same as the original code that called the `parse` function with the argument `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b` together, which is not the same as the original code that called the `parse` function with the argument `b`.

DONE.
