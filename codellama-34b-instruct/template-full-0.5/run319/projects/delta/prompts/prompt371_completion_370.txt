  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation, which could change the outcome of the `transformPosition` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation, which could change the outcome of the `transformPosition` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the next operation, which could change the outcome of the `transformPosition` method.

DONE.
