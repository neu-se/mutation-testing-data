  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not throw any errors.

DONE.
