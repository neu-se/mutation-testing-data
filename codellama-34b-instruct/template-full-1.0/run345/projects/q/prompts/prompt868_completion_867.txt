  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined();
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the original code fragment called `deferred.resolve()`.

DONE.
