 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'error'.code = 'EPIPE';
output.emit('error', new Error('Broken pipe'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a custom error code and changes the error message, which might not be caught by the tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reject('Unexpected error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message, which might not be caught by the tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
output.destroy();
reject(new Error('Stream destroyed'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it destroys the write stream and throws a new error, which might not be caught by the tests.

DONE.
