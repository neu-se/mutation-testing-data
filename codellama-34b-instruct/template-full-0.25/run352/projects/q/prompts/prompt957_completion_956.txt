  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` is a function that delays the execution of a function by a specified amount of time, while `Q` is a function that wraps a value in a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a function that applies a function to an array of arguments, while `Q` is a function that wraps a value in a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a function that applies a function to an array of arguments, while `Q` is a function that wraps a value in a promise.

DONE.
