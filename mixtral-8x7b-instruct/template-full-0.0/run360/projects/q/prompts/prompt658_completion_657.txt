 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `PLACEHOLDER` value would be incremented by 1, changing the number of arguments passed to the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would treat the `arguments` object as if it were an array, and the `null` value would be ignored, resulting in an incorrect number of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would treat the `arguments` object as if it were an array, and the function would be treated as an element of the array, resulting in an incorrect number of arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
