 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the module exports an empty object instead of the Q API.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the module would not define the Q variable on the global object when executed as a script.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Q error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the module would throw an error instead of defining the Q API or the Q global variable.

DONE.
