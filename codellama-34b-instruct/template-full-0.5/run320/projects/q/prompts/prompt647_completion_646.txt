  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is used to retrieve a property value, while the `post` method is used to set a property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to delete a property, while the `post` method is used to set a property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, while the `post` method is used to set a property value.

DONE.
