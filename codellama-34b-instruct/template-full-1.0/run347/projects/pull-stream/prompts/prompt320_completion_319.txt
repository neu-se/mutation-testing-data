  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `data` parameter, and the original code fragment assumes that `data` is a valid value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `data` parameter, and the original code fragment assumes that `data` is a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is not a valid value for the `data` parameter, and the original code fragment assumes that `data` is a valid value.

DONE.
