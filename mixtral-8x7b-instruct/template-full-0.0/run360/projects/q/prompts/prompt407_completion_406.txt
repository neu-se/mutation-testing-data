 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is an instance of `Object`, not if it's a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor.name === 'Promise'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor name of `value` is 'Promise', which may not be accurate for all promise implementations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value.then === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `then` method is undefined, which would incorrectly identify a promise as a non-promise.

DONE.
