  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the less than operator. This could cause the code to behave differently for inputs where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the greater than operator. This could cause the code to behave differently for inputs where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the less than or equal to operator, while this replacement uses the strict equality operator. This could cause the code to behave differently for inputs where `a` is equal to 0.

DONE.
