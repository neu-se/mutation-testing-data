  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEmpty(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEmpty(array)` checks whether the array is empty, while `!array` checks whether the array is falsy (i.e., whether it is false, null, undefined, or empty).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `!array.length` checks whether the length of the array is 0, while `!array` checks whether the array is falsy (i.e., whether it is false, null, undefined, or empty).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length === 0` checks whether the length of the array is exactly 0, while `!array` checks whether the array is falsy (i.e., whether it is false, null, undefined, or empty).

DONE.
