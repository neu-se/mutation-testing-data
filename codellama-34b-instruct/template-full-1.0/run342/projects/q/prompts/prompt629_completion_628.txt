  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value before setting it, which could cause unexpected changes to the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the property instead of setting it, which could cause unexpected changes to the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the property's value instead of setting it, which could cause unexpected changes to the program's behavior.

DONE.
