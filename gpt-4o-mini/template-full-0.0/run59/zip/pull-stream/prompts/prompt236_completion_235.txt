Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `end` could lead to unexpected behavior in the `read` function, potentially causing it to process data incorrectly or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because incrementing `end` by 1 may cause the `read` function to interpret the end condition incorrectly, leading to an infinite loop or skipping data that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `end` may cause the `read` function to behave unpredictably, as it may not handle `undefined` as a valid end signal, potentially leading to errors or missed data.

DONE.
