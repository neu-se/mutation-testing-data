  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is being called with a different argument, which could produce a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.peekLength(this.index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is being called with a different argument than the original code fragment, which could produce a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.peekLength(this.offset + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is being called with a different argument than the original code fragment, which could produce a different return value.

DONE.
