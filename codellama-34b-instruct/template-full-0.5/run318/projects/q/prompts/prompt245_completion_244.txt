  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter--;
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be decremented instead of incremented, which would cause the stack trace to be shorter than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the stack trace to be longer than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter;
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack counter would not be incremented at all, which would cause the stack trace to be the same length as the original code.

DONE.
