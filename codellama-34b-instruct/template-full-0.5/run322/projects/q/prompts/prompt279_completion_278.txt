  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `array_slice()` would be different, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of `array_slice()` would be different, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `array_slice()` would be different, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
