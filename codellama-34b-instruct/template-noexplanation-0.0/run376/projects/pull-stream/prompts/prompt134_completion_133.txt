  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a falsy value, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a null value, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an undefined value, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting an undefined value.

DONE.
