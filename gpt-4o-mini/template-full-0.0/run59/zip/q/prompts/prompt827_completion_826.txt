Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `Q.onerror` to `null` would prevent any unhandled errors from being processed, leading to unhandled promise rejections that are not reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning `Q.onerror` to an empty function would effectively ignore all errors, causing them to be swallowed without any notification or handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = "error";
```
This would result in different behavior because assigning a string to `Q.onerror` would cause a type error when the code attempts to call it as a function, leading to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.

DONE.
