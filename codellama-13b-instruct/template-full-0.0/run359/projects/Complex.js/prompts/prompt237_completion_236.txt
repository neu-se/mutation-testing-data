  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function returns the absolute value of a number, whereas the original code fragment returns the magnitude of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, whereas the original code fragment returns the complex square root of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function returns the cosine of a number, whereas the original code fragment returns the sine of the complex number.

DONE.
