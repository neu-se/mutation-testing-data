  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the first element of the `rule` array is a string that is equal to `word`, while this code fragment checks whether the first element of the `rule` array is not equal to `word`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the first element of the `rule` array is a regular expression that matches `word`, while this code fragment checks whether the first element of the `rule` array is not a regular expression that matches `word`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) !== 'String'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the first element of the `rule` array is a string, while this code fragment checks whether the first element of the `rule` array is not a string.
