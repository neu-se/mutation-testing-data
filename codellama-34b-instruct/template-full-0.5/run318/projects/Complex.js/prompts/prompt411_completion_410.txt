  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `a` and `b` to be zero, while this code fragment only checks `a` to be zero and ignores `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `a` and `b` to be zero, while this code fragment only checks `b` to be zero and ignores `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `a` and `b` to be zero, while this code fragment checks if their sum is zero.

DONE.
