  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `apply` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, so the `unshift` method would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` is not a function, so the `apply` method would throw an error.

DONE.
