  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `length` is the length of the current operation. Using `peekLength() - length` would result in a different value being passed to the `next()` method, which could cause the iterator to return a different operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `length` is the length of the current operation. Using `length - peekLength()` would result in a different value being passed to the `next()` method, which could cause the iterator to return a different operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength
