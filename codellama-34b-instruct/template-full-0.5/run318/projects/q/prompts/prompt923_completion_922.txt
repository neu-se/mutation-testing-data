  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which means that any errors that occur during the execution of the callback will not be caught and handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used instead of `fail`, which means that any errors that occur during the execution of the callback will be caught and handled by the `deferred.reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(function (result) {
    deferred.resolve(result);
}, function (error) {
    deferred.reject(error);
});
```
This would result in
