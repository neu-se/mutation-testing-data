  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s.source` is a function, whereas the original code fragment checks if `s` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment checks if `s` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on `s` with the `read` parameter, whereas the original code fragment does not call any methods.

DONE.
