  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the "load" event, which could cause any listeners to make assumptions about the state of the database that are not accurate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a negative value for the "load" event, which could cause any listeners to make assumptions about the state of the database that are not accurate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a value that is not a number for the "load" event, which could cause any listeners to fail when they try to use the value.

DONE.
