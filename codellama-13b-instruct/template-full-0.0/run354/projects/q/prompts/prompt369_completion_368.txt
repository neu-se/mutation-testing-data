  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called, and the promise would not be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called with a `null` value, and the promise would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called with a new `Error` object, and the promise would be rejected.

DONE.
