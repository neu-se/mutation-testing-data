  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain` is an event that is emitted when the write stream has no more data to write, whereas `'write_close'` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is an event that is emitted when the write stream has been closed, whereas `'write_close'` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is an event that is emitted when there is an error in the write stream, whereas `'write_close'` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed.

DONE.
