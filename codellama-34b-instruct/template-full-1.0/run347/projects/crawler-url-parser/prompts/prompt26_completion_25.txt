  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a single space, which would not match the same range of characters as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is the protocol for HTTP links, which would not match the same range of characters as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is an empty string, which would not match the same range of characters as the original code fragment.

DONE.
