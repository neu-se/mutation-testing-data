  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for strict inequality. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` if the function `fn` returns a value that is not strictly equal to `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true` only if the function `fn` returns the exact value `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator, which negates the result of the function `fn`. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` if the function `fn` returns a value that is not strictly equal to `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true` only if the function `fn
