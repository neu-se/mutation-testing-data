Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the first argument to `false` would prevent the URL from being parsed as a relative URL, potentially leading to incorrect handling of URLs that should be treated as relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because using `URL.format` instead of `URL.parse` would attempt to format the `currentUrlStr` as a URL string rather than parsing it, which would not provide the expected URL object structure needed for further processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the third argument to `false` would prevent the URL from being parsed with the query string, which could lead to missing query parameters in the resulting URL object.

DONE.
