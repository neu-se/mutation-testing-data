  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "'getName()'"
```
This would result in the method `getName()` being called on the object returned by `Q(object).npost(<PLACEHOLDER>, args)`, which is not the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in the `npost` method being called on the object returned by `Q(object)` without any arguments, which is not the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in the `a` property being called on the object returned by `Q(object).npost(<PLACEHOLDER>, args)`, which is not the behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
