  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `b`, which is a variable that refers to the imaginary part of a complex number. Replacing it with `b+1` would cause the complex number to have an imaginary part that is one unit greater, which would change the results of the arithmetic operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `b`, which is a variable that refers to the imaginary part of a complex number. Replacing it with `b*2` would cause the complex number to have an imaginary part that is twice the original value, which would change the results of the arithmetic operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `b`, which is a variable that refers to the imaginary part of a complex number. Replacing it with `a+
