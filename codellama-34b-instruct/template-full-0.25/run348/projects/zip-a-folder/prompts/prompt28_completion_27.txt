  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive is finalized, but the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the archive is finalized, but the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when there is an error in the archive, but the `close` event is emitted when the archive is closed.

DONE.
