  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are two different functions that are part of the Promise API. When `resolve` is called, it indicates that the Promise has been fulfilled, while `reject` indicates that the Promise has been rejected. In the original code, `resolve` is called when the response status code is 200, but if we replace `resolve` with `reject`, the Promise will be rejected even if the response status code is 200, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Request Failed.')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that is used to throw an exception. When an exception is thrown, the execution of the current function is terminated, and the exception is propagated to the caller. In the original code, `reject` is called when the response status code is not 200, but if we replace `reject` with `throw
