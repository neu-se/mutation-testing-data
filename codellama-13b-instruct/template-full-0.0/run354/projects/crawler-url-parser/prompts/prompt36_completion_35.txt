  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `undefined` instead of a parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of a parsed URL object.

DONE.
