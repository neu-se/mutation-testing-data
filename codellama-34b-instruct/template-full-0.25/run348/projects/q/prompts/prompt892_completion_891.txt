  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a function that returns a promise, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(callback(args))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by `callback(args)`, but `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by `callback`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a function that returns a promise, but `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
