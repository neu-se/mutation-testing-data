  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that handles rejection, whereas `onFulfilled` is a function that handles fulfillment. Using `onRejected` instead of `onFulfilled` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if it was fulfilled.

DONE.
