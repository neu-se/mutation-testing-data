  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 ? Infinity : Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because when `a` is zero, the original code would return `0`, but the replaced code would return `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a positive value or zero, while the replaced code would return a negative value for negative `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sign(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a positive value or zero, while the replaced code would return a positive value for negative `a`.

DONE.
