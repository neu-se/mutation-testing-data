  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.readFile`, which means that it will block the event loop until the file is read, whereas `fs.readFile` is asynchronous and will return a promise that resolves when the file is read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(fs)` is a bound version of `fs.readFile`, which means that it will always use the `fs` object as the `this` context when calling `fs.readFile`, whereas `fs.readFile` can be called with any `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null)` is a bound version of `fs
