Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the callbacks for the string `'key'` instead of the variable `key`, leading to incorrect callback associations in the `_queue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the callbacks for `null`, which would not correspond to any valid key in the `_data` map, causing the callbacks to be lost and not executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the size of the `_data` map as the key, which is a number, instead of the actual key provided, leading to incorrect storage and retrieval of callbacks.

DONE.
