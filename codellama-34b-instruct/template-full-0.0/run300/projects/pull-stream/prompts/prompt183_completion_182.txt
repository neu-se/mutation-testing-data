  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this new code checks if `i` is strictly greater than `array.length`. This means that the new code would not return the last element of the array if `i` is equal to `array.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this new code checks if `i` is less than `array.length`. This means that the new code would not return any elements of the array if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than or equal to
