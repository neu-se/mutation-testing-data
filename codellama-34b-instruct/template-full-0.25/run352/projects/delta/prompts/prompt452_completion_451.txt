  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this.hasNext`, so if `this.hasNext` is `true`, `!this.hasNext` would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `rest` method to return an empty array instead of the remaining ops in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasNext` is a method, and `this.hasNext()` would call that method and return its result. If the method returns `true`, the `rest` method would return the remaining ops in the iterator, but if it returns `false`, the `rest` method would return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index` is the current
