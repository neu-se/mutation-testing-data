 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.search(/:.+/) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the match, not the match itself, and it can't distinguish between a successful match and a non-match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/:.+/.test(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` returns a boolean indicating whether the regex matches the string, but it doesn't return the matched substring, so the matched capture group can't be extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.match(/:(.+)/)?.[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches the part after the colon, and it would return `undefined` if there is no match, which could cause errors in the rest of the code.

DONE.
