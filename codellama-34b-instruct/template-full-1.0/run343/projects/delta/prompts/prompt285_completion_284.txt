  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented, which could affect the value of `index` and the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be decremented, which could affect the value of `index` and the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable would be incremented, which could affect the number of iterations made by the `eachLine` method and the behavior of the code.

DONE.
