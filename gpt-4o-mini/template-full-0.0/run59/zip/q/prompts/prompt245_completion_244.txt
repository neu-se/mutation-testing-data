Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to always return `{ state: "pending" }`, regardless of the actual state of the promise, leading to incorrect promise state reporting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect("unexpected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an unexpected string argument to the `inspect` method, which may not be handled correctly, potentially causing an error or unexpected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method without any arguments, which may lead to different handling of the promise state compared to the original code that expects a specific argument, potentially resulting in incorrect state information.

DONE.
