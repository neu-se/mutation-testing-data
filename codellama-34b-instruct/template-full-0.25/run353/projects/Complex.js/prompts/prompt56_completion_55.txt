  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `a['arg']`, which would change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `a['arg']`, which would change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the value of `a['arg']`, which would change the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
