  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the value of `a` to be used as the denominator instead of `d`. As a result, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the value of `b` to be used as the denominator instead of `d`. As a result, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` even if `b` is not equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the value of `b` to be used as the denominator instead of `d`, but with a negated sign. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `b` is not equal to `0
