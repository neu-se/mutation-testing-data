  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `content` is a string, and adding the string `"bug"` to it would result in a new string that is different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `content` is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would result in a new string that is different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `content` is a string, and getting the `length` property of it would result in a different value than the original.

DONE.
