  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would return `true` if `b` is any falsy value, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would only return `true` if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would check for strict equality between `b` and `undefined`, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator would check for equality between `b` and `null`, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
