 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be always resolved, even when an error occurs. The original code fragment rejects the promise in case of an error, which allows the error to be handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would not be called, and the error would not be propagated. Instead, a new empty function would be called, effectively suppressing the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is an object, and passing an object to `fail` would not cause an error to be thrown. Instead, the promise would simply continue to the next `then` block without any error handling.

DONE.
