  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, while `call` expects a list of comma-separated arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, while `call` and `apply` call the function with the provided context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call(null)` would call the function with a null context, while `call` and `apply` call the function with the provided context.

DONE.
