Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` function to always break the loop when it encounters `undefined`, potentially skipping valid entries in the `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` function to apply the match function to the key instead of the value, which may not be the intended logic for iterating over the stored data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value by adding 1 to it, which could lead to incorrect processing of the data if the values are not numeric, thus altering the intended logic of the iteration.

DONE.
