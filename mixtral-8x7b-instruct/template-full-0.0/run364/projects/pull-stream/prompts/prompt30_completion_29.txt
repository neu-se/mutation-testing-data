 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the 4th argument instead of the 3rd one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the array and returns it, instead of accessing the 3rd element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the array and shifts all other elements to lower indices, instead of accessing the 3rd element.

DONE.
