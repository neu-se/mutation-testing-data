  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country instead of the country object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country object, which may not exist in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(countries)[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country object, which may not exist in the data.

DONE.
