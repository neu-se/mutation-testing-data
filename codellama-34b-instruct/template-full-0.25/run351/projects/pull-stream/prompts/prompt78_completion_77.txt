  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without executing any further code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('intentional error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `try` block and passed to the `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop would cause the function to run indefinitely, without executing any further code.

DONE.
