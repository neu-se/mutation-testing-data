  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, while `null` is an object. In this context, `undefined` would indicate that the function did not find any matching data, while `null` would indicate that the function found a matching data that is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value, while `null` is an object. In this context, `false` would indicate that the function did not find any matching data, while `null` would indicate that the function found a matching data that is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, while `null` is an object. In this context, `0` would indicate that the function did not find any matching data, while `null` would indicate that the function found a matching data that is null.
