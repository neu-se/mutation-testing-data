  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement code fragment is using the `length` property of the `array` object. This could cause the function to return a different value, depending on the specific implementation of the `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement code fragment is using the `slice()` method of the `array` object. This could cause the function to return a different value, depending on the specific implementation of the `slice()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(function (x) { return x !== undefined })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `array` variable directly, while this replacement code fragment is using the `filter()` method of the `array`
