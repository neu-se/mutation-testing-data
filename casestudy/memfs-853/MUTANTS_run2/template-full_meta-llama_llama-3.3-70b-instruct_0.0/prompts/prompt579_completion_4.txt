Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message to include the resolved path of the link instead of the original filename, potentially leading to different error handling or logging behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
steps.join(sep)
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the error message using the steps of the filename instead of the original filename, which could lead to different error messages being displayed to the user.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
dirLink.getPath() + sep + steps[steps.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the error message using the path of the parent directory and the last step of the filename, instead of the original filename, potentially leading to different error handling or logging behavior.

DONE.
