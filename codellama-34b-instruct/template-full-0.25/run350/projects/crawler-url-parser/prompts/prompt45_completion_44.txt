  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter would be parsed with `slashesDenoteHost` and `parseQueryString` set to `false`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter would be parsed with `slashesDenoteHost` set to `true`, but `parseQueryString` set to `false`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter would be parsed with `parseQueryString` set to `true`, but `slashesDenoteHost` set to `false`, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
