  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pop the last element from the `arr` array and return it. However, replacing it with `return '';` would return an empty string instead, which would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over the `arr` array and execute the callback function for each element, but the callback function would always return an empty string, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);`, which would pop the last element from the `arr` array and return it. However, replacing it with `return null;` would return `null` instead, which would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over the `arr` array and execute the callback function for each element, but the callback function would always return `null
