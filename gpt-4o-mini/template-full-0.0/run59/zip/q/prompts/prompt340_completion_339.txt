Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the promise is fulfilled instead of checking for pending or rejected states, which would lead to incorrect handling of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the promise to be considered valid if it is in any state other than rejected, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending" && inspected.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the state is pending and also if the value is defined, which is not a valid condition for determining the promise's state, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
