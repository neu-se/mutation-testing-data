  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` expression would always evaluate to `true`, causing the loop to execute indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` expression would always evaluate to `undefined`, causing the loop to execute indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source.length; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source.length` expression would always evaluate to `0`, causing the loop to execute indefinitely.

DONE.
