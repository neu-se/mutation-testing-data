  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use HTTPS instead of HTTP, which could cause issues if the website does not support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always include the "www." subdomain, which could cause issues if the website does not use a subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the domain "example.com" instead of the actual domain, which could cause issues if the website is not hosted on that domain.

DONE.
