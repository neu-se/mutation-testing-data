  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called when the archive is successfully created, while the `reject` function is called when there is an error. Replacing `resolve` with `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected even when the archive is created successfully, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a new error object, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an error. This would result in different behavior than the original code, which resolved the promise with the archive stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Test error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in the promise being rejected. This would result in different behavior than the original code, which resolved the promise
