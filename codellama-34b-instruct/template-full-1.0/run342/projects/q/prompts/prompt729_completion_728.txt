  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return an empty array instead of the array of resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[promises[0], promises[1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return an array of only the first two promises instead of the array of all promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[promises[promises.length-1]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return an array of only the last promise instead of the array of all promises.

DONE.
