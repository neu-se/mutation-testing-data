  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `--` operator is used instead of the `++` operator, causing the `i` variable to decrement instead of increment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` expression is used instead of the `i++` expression, causing the `i` variable to be incremented by 1 instead of being incremented by itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max` variable is used instead of the `i` variable, causing the callback to be called with the maximum value instead of the current value of `i`.

DONE.
