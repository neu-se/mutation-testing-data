  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the second element of an array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the length of an array instead of a specific element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] + fileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the first and second elements of an array together instead of accessing a single element.

DONE.
