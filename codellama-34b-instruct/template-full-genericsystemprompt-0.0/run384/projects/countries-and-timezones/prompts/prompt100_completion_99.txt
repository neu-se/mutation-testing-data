  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of timezones in the `tzs` object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the values in the `tzs` object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs in the `tzs` object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
