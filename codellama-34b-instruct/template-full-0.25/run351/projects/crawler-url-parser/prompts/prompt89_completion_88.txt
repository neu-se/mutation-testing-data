  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the first anchor element within the current element, rather than the text content of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the parent element of the current element, rather than the text content of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).siblings().text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the sibling elements of the current element, rather than the text content of the current element.

DONE.
