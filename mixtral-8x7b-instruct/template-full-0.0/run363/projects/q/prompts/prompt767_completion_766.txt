 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `noop` function returns `undefined`, while `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise. This change could cause issues if the rest of the code expects `noop`'s return value to be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('handled'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `noop` function is a no-operation function, while this replacement throws an error. This change could expose potential error handling issues in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
