  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with the string `'http://'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces it with the string `'https://'`.

DONE.
