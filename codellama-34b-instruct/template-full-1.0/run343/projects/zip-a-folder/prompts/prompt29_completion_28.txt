  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because using `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, which is the opposite of what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because using `resolve` with an argument of `'foo'` would cause the promise to resolve with the value `'foo'`, which is different from what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('foo'))
```
This would result in different behavior because using `resolve` with an argument of `new Error('foo')` would cause the promise to resolve with an error object, which is different from what the original code does.

DONE.
