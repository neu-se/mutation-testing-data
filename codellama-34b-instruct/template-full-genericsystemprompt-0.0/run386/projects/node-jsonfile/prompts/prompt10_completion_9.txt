  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is not being passed to `JSON.parse` in the original code.

DONE.
