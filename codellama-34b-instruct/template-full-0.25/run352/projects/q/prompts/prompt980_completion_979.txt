  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be populated with `undefined` instead of a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method would be called with a different `this` context, which could cause errors if the method relies on `this` being a specific object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function would be added to the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause errors if the function is expected to have a specific behavior.

DONE.
