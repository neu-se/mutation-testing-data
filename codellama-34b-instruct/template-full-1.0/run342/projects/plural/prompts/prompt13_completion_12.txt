  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` and `substr()` have different parameters and are used for different purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` and `substr()` have different parameters and are used for different purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace()` and `substr()` have different parameters and are used for different purposes.

DONE.
