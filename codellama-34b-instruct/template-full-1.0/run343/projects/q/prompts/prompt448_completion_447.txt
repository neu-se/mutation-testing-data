  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop( );
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` would remove an element from the end of the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift( )
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
