  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, even if `a[key]` is already defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] += b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]`, even if `a[key]` is already defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] = b[key] || a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `b[key]` to `a[key]` if it is defined, or `a[key]` if it is not defined.

DONE.
