  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes two arguments, whereas `cb` is a function that takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents the absence of a value, whereas `cb` is a function that expects to be called with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value that represents the absence of a value, whereas `cb` is a function that expects to be called with a value.

DONE.
