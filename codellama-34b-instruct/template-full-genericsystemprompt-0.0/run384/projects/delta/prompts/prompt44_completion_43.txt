  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `a` to be any type, not just objects or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow `a` to be null, not any other type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `a` to be any type except null.

DONE.
