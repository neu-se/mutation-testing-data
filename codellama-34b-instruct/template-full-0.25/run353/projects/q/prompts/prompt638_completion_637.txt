  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the key as an argument to the `delete` method, while this modified code fragment passes both the key and value as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value as a variable, while this modified code fragment passes the value as a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value as a variable, while this modified code fragment passes `null` as the value.

DONE.
