 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line, {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the attributes of the next operation, which could lead to unexpected results if the attributes are relevant for the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Delta(), {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new empty Delta instead of using the next operation, which could lead to incorrect line counting or other issues if the predicate function relies on the contents of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
line, iter.next(1), i
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the attributes of the current operation instead of the next operation, which could lead to unexpected results if the attributes are relevant for the predicate function.

DONE.
