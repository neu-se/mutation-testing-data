  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort()` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `cb`, but the original code fragment only passes a single argument, `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort(err)` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `cb`, but the original code fragment only passes a single argument, `abort`. Additionally, the `err` argument is not defined in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink.abort(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink.abort(null, cb)` is a function that takes two arguments, `err` and `cb`, but the original code fragment only passes a single argument, `abort`. Additionally, the `
