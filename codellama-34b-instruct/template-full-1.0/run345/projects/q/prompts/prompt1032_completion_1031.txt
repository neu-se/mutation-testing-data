  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with `null` as the first argument instead of `error`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(new TypeError())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeback` function to be called with a `TypeError` object instead of the original `error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.bind(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeback` function to be bound to `null` instead of the original `this` value, and would also cause the first argument to be `null` instead of the original `error`.

DONE.
