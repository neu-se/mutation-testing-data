  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] + options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] * options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `countries[id]` property by the `options` object, instead of returning it as the function's return value.

DONE.
