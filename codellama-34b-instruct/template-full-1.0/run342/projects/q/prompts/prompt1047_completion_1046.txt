  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `error` variable is passed as argument to the `closed.resolve` method, which means that the promise returned by `closed.promise` is rejected with the error value. Replacing the `error` variable with `null` would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead, which could potentially cause issues in the code that depends on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `error` variable is passed as argument to the `closed.resolve` method, which means that the promise returned by `closed.promise` is rejected with the error value. Replacing the `error` variable with `undefined` would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead, which could potentially cause issues in the code that depends on the promise.
