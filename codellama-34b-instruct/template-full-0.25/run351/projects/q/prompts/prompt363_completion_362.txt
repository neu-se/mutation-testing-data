  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the rejected value instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the progressed value instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the fulfilled value instead of the rejected value.

DONE.
