  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.makeQ
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.makeQ` is a function that creates a new Q object, while `ses.ok` is a boolean property that indicates whether the current environment is a secure environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.makeQ()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.makeQ()` is a function call that creates a new Q object, while `ses.ok` is a boolean property that indicates whether the current environment is a secure environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.makeQ(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.makeQ(function () {})` is a function call that creates a new Q object and passes an empty function as an argument, while `ses.ok` is a boolean property that indicates whether the current environment is a secure environment.

DONE.
