  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed immediately, rather than being returned as a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method would be used to create a rejected promise, rather than throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.resolve(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` method would be used to create a resolved promise, rather than throwing an error.

DONE.
