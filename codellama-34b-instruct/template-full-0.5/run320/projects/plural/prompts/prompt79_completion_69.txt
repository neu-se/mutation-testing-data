  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "goat" is not a valid plural form, and the function would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different result, as the word "goose" is not a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different result, as the word "goose" is not a valid plural form.

DONE.
