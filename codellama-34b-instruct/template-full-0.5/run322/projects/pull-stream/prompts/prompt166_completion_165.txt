  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is being passed as `null`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to return `null` instead of the expected `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(undefined, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is being passed as `undefined`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to return `undefined` instead of the expected `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(false, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is being passed as `false`, which would cause the `abortCb` function to return `false` instead of the expected `true`.

DONE.
