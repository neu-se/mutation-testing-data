  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return `0` instead of `-1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return `1` instead of `-1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return `2` instead of `-1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong promise object.

DONE.
