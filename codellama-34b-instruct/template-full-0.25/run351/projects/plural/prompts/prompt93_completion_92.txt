  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "chillies" with an extra "s" at the end, while the new code fragment has the word "chillis" with only one "s" at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable reference.

DONE.
