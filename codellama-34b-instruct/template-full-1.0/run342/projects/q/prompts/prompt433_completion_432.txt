  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` would be greater than 1, so the process archiver would be emitted and the tracked rejections would be reset.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` would be greater than or equal to 1, so the process archiver would be emitted and the tracked rejections would be reset.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` would be less than 1, so the process archiver would not be emitted and the tracked rejections would not be reset.

DONE.
