  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the function to behave differently when it is passed a string value for `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is an empty string. This could cause the function to behave differently when it is passed an empty string value for `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `test` is a number, while this replacement checks if it is null. This could cause the function to behave differently when it is passed a null value for `test`.

DONE.
