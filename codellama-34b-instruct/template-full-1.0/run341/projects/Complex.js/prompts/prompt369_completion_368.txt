  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `sinh` are inverse functions, and the resulting function would be approximately equal to the original function, but not exactly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `sinh` are related functions, but the resulting function would not be exactly equal to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` and `asinh` are inverse functions, but the resulting function would not be equal to the original function.

DONE.
