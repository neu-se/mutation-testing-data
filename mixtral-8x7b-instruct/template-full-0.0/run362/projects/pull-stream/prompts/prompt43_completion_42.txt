 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ref` array, so modifying the result of `ref.unshift(read)` will not affect the original `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pull.apply` call to fail, since the `ref` array is required as the context for the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of `ref` from an array to an object, causing the `switch` statement to always execute the `default` case and potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
