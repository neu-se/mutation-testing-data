  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a truthy value, while the replaced code would always return null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests whether the `data` variable has a truthy value, while the replaced code tests whether the negation of `data` has a truthy value, which is the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code tests whether the `data` variable has a truthy value, while the replaced code tests whether the `data` variable plus 1 has a truthy value, which is a different computation.

DONE.
