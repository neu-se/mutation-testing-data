  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String` constructor would attempt to convert the input to a string, whereas the `Number` constructor would attempt to convert the input to a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` would return the sine of the input, whereas `Number` would attempt to convert the input to a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined`, whereas `Number` would attempt to convert the input to a number.

DONE.
