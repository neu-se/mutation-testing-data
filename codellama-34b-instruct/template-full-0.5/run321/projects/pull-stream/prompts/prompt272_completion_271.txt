  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method would cause the stream to be piped to the new destination, rather than simply returning the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would cause the stream to be transformed in some way, rather than simply returning the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would cause the stream to be filtered, rather than simply returning the stream.

DONE.
