  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol if it is not already present in the URL, while this new fragment replaces the protocol regardless of whether it is present or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new fragment replaces it with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new fragment replaces it with "ftp://".
