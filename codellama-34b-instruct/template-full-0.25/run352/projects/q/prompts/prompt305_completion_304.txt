  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip over every other element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the counter instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to iterate in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the counter by 10 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip over many elements in the array.

DONE.
