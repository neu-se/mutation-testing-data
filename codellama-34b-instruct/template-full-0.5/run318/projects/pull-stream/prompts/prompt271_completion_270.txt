  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `values` property of the `stream` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the `values` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `value` property of the `stream` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the `values` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `values` function with the `stream` object as an argument, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
