Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the callback function `cb` without any arguments, which may lead to unexpected results if `cb` expects parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `cb` only if `abort` is truthy, effectively ignoring the callback when `abort` is false or undefined, which changes the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original callback with `null`, meaning that no callback function is referenced, which could lead to runtime errors if the code attempts to call `cb`.

DONE.
