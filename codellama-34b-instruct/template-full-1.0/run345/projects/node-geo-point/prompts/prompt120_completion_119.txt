  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be offset by 10 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 0.5, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance value would be halved, which would cause the destination point to be calculated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing value would be inverted, which would cause the destination point to be calculated differently.

DONE.
