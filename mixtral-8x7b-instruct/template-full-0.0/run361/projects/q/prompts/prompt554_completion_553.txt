 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return callback; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would always return the `callback` function itself instead of invoking it, causing the promise chain to continue without actually executing the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function with a fixed `this` value, which could cause issues if the original function relies on the dynamic `this` value provided by the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
