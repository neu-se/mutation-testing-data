  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined for the `handler` object, and would therefore throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to the `invert` method is reversed, which could cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is being called with an additional argument, which could cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
