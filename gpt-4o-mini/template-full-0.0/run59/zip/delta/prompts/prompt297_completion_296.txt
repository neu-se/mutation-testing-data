Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `iter.peek()` instead of `iter.next(1)`, which means it checks the attributes of the next operation without consuming it, potentially leading to different outcomes in subsequent iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the attributes entirely by passing an empty object, which may lead to a different evaluation of the predicate compared to using the actual attributes of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || { key: 'value' }, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it provides a default attribute object with a specific key-value pair instead of the actual attributes, which could change the logic of the predicate evaluation.

DONE.
