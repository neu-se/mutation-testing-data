  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.hasNext()` always returns `true` when there are more ops to iterate over, whereas the original code fragment `thisIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>)` allows for the possibility of there being no more ops to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` always returns the length of the next op, whereas the original code fragment `thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` allows for the possibility of there being no next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` always returns the next op, whereas the original code fragment `thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)` allows for the possibility of there
