 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function's callback would not be invoked, and the script would terminate immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called without the expected error or data arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Done!')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function's callback would not be invoked, and the script would continue executing after the `find` function, potentially causing unexpected side effects.

DONE.
