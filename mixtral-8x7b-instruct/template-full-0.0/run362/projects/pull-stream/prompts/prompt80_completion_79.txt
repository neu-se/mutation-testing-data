 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will continue even if `cbed` is true, causing the function to read more data than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will never stop, causing the function to read data indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop will continue even if `cbed` is true, causing the function to read more data than intended.

DONE.
