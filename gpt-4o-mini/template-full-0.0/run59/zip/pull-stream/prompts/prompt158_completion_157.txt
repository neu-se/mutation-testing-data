Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and the callback `cb` would receive `undefined` as the first argument instead of `null`, potentially leading to different handling in the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `false` instead of `null` would change the truthiness of the first argument in the callback `cb`, which could affect how the callback processes the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `'error'` instead of `null` would change the type of the first argument in the callback `cb`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the callback is not designed to handle string inputs.

DONE.
