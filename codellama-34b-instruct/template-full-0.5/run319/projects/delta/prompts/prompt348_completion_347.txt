  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `baseOpData` to be incremented by 1, which would change the result of the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function and potentially cause the `invert` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData, opData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOpData` and `opData` would be swapped, which would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return different values and potentially cause the `invert` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1, baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `opData` to be incremented by 1, which would change the result of the `getEmbedTypeAndData`
