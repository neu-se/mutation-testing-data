  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `isInfinite()`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `isInfinite()` returns `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks whether the number is a finite real number, while `isInfinite()` checks whether the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks whether the number is not a number (NaN), while `isInfinite()` checks whether the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
