Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point as if the distance was twice as far, leading to an incorrect location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 100 meters to the distance, resulting in a destination point that is further away than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the destination point as if the distance was half as far, leading to an incorrect location that is closer than expected.

DONE.
