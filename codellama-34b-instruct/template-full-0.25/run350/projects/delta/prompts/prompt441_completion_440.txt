  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a method that returns a portion of a string, while `substr` is a method that returns a portion of a string and also allows you to specify a starting position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a portion of a string, while `substr` is a method that returns a portion of a string and also allows you to specify a starting position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings, while `substr` is a method that returns a portion of a string.

DONE.
