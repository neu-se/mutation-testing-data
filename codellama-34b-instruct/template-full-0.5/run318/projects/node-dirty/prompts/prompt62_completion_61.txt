  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error("Forced error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a new error object, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed and an error to be emitted, even if the read stream is not in an error state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a null error object, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed and an error to be emitted, even if the read stream is not in an error state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a boolean false value, which would cause the read stream to be destroyed and an error to be emitted, even if the read stream is not in an error state.
