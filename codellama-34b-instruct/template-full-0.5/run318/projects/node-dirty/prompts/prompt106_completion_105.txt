  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` property is the key of the object, whereas `row.val` is the value of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.val + 1` expression would add 1 to the value of the object, whereas `row.val` would return the value of the object as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(row.key)` would return the value of the object stored in the `this._data` map, whereas `row.val` would return the value of the object as is.

DONE.
