  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` parameter would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be parsed as a path instead of a host, which would lead to incorrect results in the `parse` function.
