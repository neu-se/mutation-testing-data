  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match carriage return characters instead of line feed characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\t/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match tab characters instead of line feed characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\s/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any whitespace character instead of line feed characters.

DONE.
