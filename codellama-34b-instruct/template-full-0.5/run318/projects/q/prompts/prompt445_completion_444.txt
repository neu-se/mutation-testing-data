  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, "rejectionHandled" instead of "unhandledRejection".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise argument is null instead of the actual promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is the same, but the promise argument is null instead of the actual promise.

DONE.
