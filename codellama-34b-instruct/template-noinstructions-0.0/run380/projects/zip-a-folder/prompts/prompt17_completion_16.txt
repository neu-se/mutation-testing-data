  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetBasePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the `targetBasePath` string, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is not valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.replace('base', 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the first occurrence of the string 'base' with 'foo', which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the path is not valid.

DONE.
