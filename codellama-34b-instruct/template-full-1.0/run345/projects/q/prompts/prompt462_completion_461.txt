  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` searches for the index of a specific element in an array, while `pop` removes the last element from an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` removes elements from an array starting from a specified index, while `array_indexOf` searches for the index of a specific element in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from an array, while `array_indexOf` searches for the index of a specific element in an array.

DONE.
