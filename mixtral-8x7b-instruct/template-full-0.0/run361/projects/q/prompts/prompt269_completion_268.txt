 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Promise.resolve(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be immediately resolved as a successful promise, instead of being a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be turned into a resolved promise, instead of remaining as a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q(reason); }
