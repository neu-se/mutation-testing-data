  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country than the original code fragment, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country than the original code fragment, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country than the original code fragment, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
