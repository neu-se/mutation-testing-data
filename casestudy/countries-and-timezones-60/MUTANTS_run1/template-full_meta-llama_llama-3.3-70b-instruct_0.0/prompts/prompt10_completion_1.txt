Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset / 120
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator is still used, but the divisor is changed from 60 to 120, which would result in a different calculation for the hours.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function is used instead of `Math.floor`, which would round up to the nearest integer instead of down, potentially changing the calculated hours.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is used instead of division, which would result in a completely different calculation for the hours, likely producing an incorrect result.

DONE.
