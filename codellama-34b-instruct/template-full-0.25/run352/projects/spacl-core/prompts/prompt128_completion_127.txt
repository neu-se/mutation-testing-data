  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the condition is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one less time, as the condition is always false.

DONE.
