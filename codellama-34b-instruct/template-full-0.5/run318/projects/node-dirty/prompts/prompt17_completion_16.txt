  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 2, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

DONE.
