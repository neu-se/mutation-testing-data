  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `array_slice` is replaced with `null`, the function will throw a `TypeError` because `null` is not a function, and it will be incompatible with the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `array_slice` is replaced with `undefined`, the function will return `undefined` instead of the expected slice of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because if `array_slice` is replaced with an empty array, the function will return an empty array instead of the expected slice of the array.

DONE.
