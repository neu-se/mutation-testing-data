  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string representing the type of the argument, whereas the original fragment just returns the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` is the length of the array `data`, whereas the original fragment is just the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data[0]` is the first element of the array `data`, whereas the original fragment is just the value of `data`.

DONE.
