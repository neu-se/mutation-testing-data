  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"DONE"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to always return a resolved promise with the value "DONE", regardless of the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to always return a resolved promise with the value `null`, regardless of the input array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `any` function to always return a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, regardless of the input array.

DONE.
