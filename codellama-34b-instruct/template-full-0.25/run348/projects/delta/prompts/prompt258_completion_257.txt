  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is a different property than `thisOp.insert`, and it may not be a valid replacement in the context of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different property than `thisOp.insert`, and it may not be a valid replacement in the context of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `thisOp.insert`, and it may not be a valid replacement in the context of the code.

DONE.
