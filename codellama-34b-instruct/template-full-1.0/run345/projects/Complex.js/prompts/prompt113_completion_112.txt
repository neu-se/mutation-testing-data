  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this. instanceof Complex)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the object is an instance of the `Complex` class, while this modified code checks if the property `instanceof` exists in the object and has the value `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex !== this.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the object is an instance of the `Complex` class, while this modified code checks if the constructor function of the object is different from the `Complex` constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasOwnProperty('re')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the object has a property `re`, while this modified code checks if the object has its own property `re`.

DONE.
