 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.resolve` function would be set to `null`, making it impossible to resolve the `next` deferred object. This could cause the queue to stop functioning correctly, as items may not be added properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ends` deferred object to be resolved immediately, rather than resolving the `next` deferred object. This could cause the queue to become stuck, as new items would not be able to be added to the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { /* do nothing */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.resolve` function would be replaced with an empty function, making it impossible to resolve the `next` deferred object. This could cause the queue to stop functioning correctly, as items may not be added properly.
