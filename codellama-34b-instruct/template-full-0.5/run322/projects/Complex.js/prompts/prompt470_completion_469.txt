  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if 1 is not equal to `b`. This change would cause the `toString()` method to return a different value if `b` is not equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the `toString()` method to return a different value if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is greater than 1. This change would cause
