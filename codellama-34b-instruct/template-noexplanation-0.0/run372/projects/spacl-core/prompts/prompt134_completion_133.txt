Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.values()
```
This change will cause the `for...in` loop to iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys. This will result in the loop body being executed for each value in the `verbs` object, rather than each key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs.entries()
```
This change will cause the `for...in` loop to iterate over the entries of the `verbs` object, rather than the keys or values. This will result in the loop body being executed for each entry in
