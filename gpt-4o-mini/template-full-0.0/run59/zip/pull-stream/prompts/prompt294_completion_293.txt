Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `false` to the callback, indicating an error condition, whereas the original code simply calls `cb` with the value of `err` or `true`, which could lead to different handling of the termination condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the value of `ended` to the callback, which may not necessarily be `true` or `err`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the end state in the calling function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback with two `null` values, which may not provide the expected error or data, leading to confusion in the handling of the callback's response compared to the original behavior of passing `err` or `true`.

DONE.
