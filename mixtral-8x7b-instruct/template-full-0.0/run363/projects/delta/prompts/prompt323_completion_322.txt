 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.current().attributes.start
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `start` property of the `attributes` object of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator, which may not be defined or may have a different value than `baseIndex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the slice's start index to 0, ignoring the `baseIndex` value. This may lead to incorrect slicing of the `base` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(baseIndex - length, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the slice's start index to the maximum of `baseIndex - length` or 0. This may lead to slicing a different portion of the `base` Delta, especially when `baseIndex` is less than `length`.

DONE.
