  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `countryId` is an integer, while `countryId + 1` is a string. The `getCountry` function expects an integer, so the behavior of the function would change if `countryId + 1` is passed as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `countryId` is an integer, while `countryId - 1` is a string. The `getCountry` function expects an integer, so the behavior of the function would change if `countryId - 1` is passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `countryId` is an integer, while `countryId * 2` is a string. The `getCountry` function expects an integer,
