  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [int]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key to be deleted is now an integer, which may not exist in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array passed to the "delete" method now contains two values, which would not make sense in a call to the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called is now "post" instead of "delete", which would not be expected and could cause errors.

DONE.
