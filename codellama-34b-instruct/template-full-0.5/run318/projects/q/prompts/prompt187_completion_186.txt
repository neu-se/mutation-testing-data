  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string, which could potentially change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method splits the string into an array of substrings, and the `[0]` index would select the first element of the array, which could potentially change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method extracts a substring from the original string, and the `[0, 10]` range would select the first 10 characters of the string, which could potentially change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function.
