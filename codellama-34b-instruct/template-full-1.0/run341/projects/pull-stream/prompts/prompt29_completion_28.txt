  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` is the first element of the `ref` array, while `ref[1]` is the second element. Using `ref[0]` would cause the `switch` statement to take a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` is the number of elements in the `ref` array, while `ref[1]` is the second element. Using `ref.length` would cause the `switch` statement to take a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `switch` statement. Using `null` would cause the `switch` statement to throw an error.

DONE.
