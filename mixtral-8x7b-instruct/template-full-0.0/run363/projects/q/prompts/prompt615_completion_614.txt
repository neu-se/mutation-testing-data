 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects an object and passing `null` would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects an object and passing an empty array would not throw an error, but it would not provide the desired property access behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects an object and passing a function would not throw an error, but it would not provide the desired property access behavior.

DONE.
