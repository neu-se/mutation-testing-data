  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element in the array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to skip all the elements before the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle element in the array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to skip all the elements before the middle one.

DONE.
