Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the `index` to `start`, potentially causing the `nextOp` to be fetched from an incorrect position in the operations, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `start` by 2, which would skip over operations and may lead to missing elements in the resulting slice, altering the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always fetches the first operation regardless of the `start` value, which would not respect the intended slicing behavior and could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
