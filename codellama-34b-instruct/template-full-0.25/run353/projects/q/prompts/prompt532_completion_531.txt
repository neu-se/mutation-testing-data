This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `Q(value).then` is a method that returns a promise for the return value or thrown exception of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all

This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised array of arguments into the fulfillment callback, while `Q(value).all` is a method that returns a promise for the return value or thrown exception of the callback, but it also waits for all the promises in the array to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).any
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).spread` is a method that spreads the values of a promised
