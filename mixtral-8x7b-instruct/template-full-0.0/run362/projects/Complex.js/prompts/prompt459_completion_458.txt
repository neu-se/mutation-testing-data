 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isFinite(this['im'] || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `re` and `im` are finite, while this modification only checks if `im` is finite or equals 1 if it's `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this modification checks if the product of `re` and `im` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while this modification only checks if the real part is greater than zero.

DONE.
