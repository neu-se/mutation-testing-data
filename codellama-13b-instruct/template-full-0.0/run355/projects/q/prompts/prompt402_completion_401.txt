  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this code fragment returns the rejection reason. This could cause the promise to be resolved with the rejection reason instead of being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this code fragment returns nothing. This could cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Unhandled rejection"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an exception, while this code fragment throws a new error. This could cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of the original rejection reason.

DONE.
