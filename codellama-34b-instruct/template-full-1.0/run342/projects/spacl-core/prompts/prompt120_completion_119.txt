  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx[path]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the property of the `ctx` object that matches the given path, whereas the original code retrieves the `ctx` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the `path` starting from the second character, whereas the original code retrieves the full `path` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[ctx.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the character at the index of the length of the `ctx` object minus one, whereas the original code retrieves the first character of the `path` string.

DONE.
