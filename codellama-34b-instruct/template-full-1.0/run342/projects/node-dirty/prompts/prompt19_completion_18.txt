  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` variable is not the same as the `key` variable in the original code, which is used to store the key-value pair in the `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, [cbs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable is not a callback function, but an array of callback functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cbs
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `key` variable, but it would not be a valid value for the `_data` map.

DONE.
