  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the value of `thisOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `insert` property of `thisOp`, rather than returning the `opLength` which is the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `delete` property of `op`, rather than returning the `opLength` which is the length of the current operation.

DONE.
