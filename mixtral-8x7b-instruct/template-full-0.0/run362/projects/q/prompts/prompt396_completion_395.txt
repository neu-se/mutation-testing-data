 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function now throws an error with the value instead of returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function now returns undefined instead of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { return value * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function now multiplies the value by 2 instead of just returning it.

DONE.
