  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, while `object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')` returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, but only if the property is a direct property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.apply(object, ['latitude'])

This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, while `object.hasOwnProperty.apply(object, ['latitude'])` returns a boolean value indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, but only if the property is a direct property of the object.
