  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only emits the error message, while the new code fragment creates a new error object with the error message as the message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the error object, while the new code fragment only emits the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the error object, while the new code fragment only emits the error stack trace.

DONE.
