  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would resolve the promise with the given value, while `null` would resolve the promise with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would resolve the promise with the given value, while `undefined` would resolve the promise with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would resolve the promise with the given value, while `throw new Error()` would reject the promise with an error.

DONE.
