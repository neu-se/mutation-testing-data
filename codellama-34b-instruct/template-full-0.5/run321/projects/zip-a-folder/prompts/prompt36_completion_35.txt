  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write();
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write()` would write to the output stream immediately, whereas the original code fragment `output` would only write to the output stream when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would close the output stream immediately, whereas the original code fragment `output` would only close the output stream when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('end', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `output.on('end', ...)` would be called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `output` would only call the callback function when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
