  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat([1, 2, 3])` would return a new array with the elements of the original array followed by the elements `[1, 2, 3]`, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x % 2 === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x % 2 === 0; })` would return a new array with
