 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result changes, as it becomes positive instead of negative. This is because the original code fragment (`b`) is squared in the original implementation, which is now replaced by `b * b` that keeps the sign of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the second component of the complex number changes. This is because the original code fragment (`b`) is negated in the original implementation, which is now replaced by `-b` that keeps the negation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now handles division by zero when `b` is zero. This is different from the original implementation, which would result in a `NaN` value for the second component of the complex number.

DONE.
