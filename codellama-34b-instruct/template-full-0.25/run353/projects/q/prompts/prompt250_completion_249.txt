  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the tab character would be included in the stack trace, which could cause issues with the promise's error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because a space character would be included in the stack trace, which could cause issues with the promise's error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would be included in the stack trace, which could cause issues with the promise's error handling.

DONE.
