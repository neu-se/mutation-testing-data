  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is a string, while `baseOp` is an object with an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.attributes` is an object, while `baseOp` is an object with an `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain` is a number, while `baseOp` is an object with an `insert` property.

DONE.
