  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `key` variable from the outer scope instead of the `key` property of the `row` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `key` property of the `row` object instead of the `key` variable from the outer scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `undefined` value instead of the `key` property of the `row` object.

DONE.
