  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter would be incremented by 1, causing the pluralization function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter would be decremented by 1, causing the pluralization function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(word, num * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter would be multiplied by 2, causing the pluralization function to return a different result.

DONE.
