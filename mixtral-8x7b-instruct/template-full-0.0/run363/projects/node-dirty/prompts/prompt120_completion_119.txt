 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_flush` method would execute even when there are in-flight writes, potentially causing data inconsistency or a race condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_flush` method would only execute when there is exactly one in-flight write, which might not be the desired behavior, and could lead to data not being written to the file when expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites >= 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_flush` method would only execute when there are 10 or more in-flight writes, causing potential delays in writing data to the file and affecting the overall performance of the application.

DONE.
