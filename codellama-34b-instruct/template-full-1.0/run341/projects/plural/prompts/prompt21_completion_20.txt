  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `addRule` function expects a regular expression as its first argument, and undefined is not a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `addRule` function expects a regular expression as its first argument, and null is not a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = /a/g;
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/g` does not match any of the input strings in the test suite, so the `addRule` function will return the input string unchanged.

DONE.
