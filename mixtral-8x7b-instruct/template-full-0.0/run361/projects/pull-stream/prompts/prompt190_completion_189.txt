 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with `null`, which might not cover all cases where `map` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `map` has a `length` property and its value is greater than 0, which might not be the intended condition for the `asyncMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof map === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `map` is of type `undefined`, which might not cover all cases where `map` is not defined or initialized.

These changes would introduce different behavior in the code, potentially causing the test suite to fail and highlighting areas where the tests could be improved. DONE.
