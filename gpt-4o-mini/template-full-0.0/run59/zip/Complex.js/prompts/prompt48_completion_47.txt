Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) || Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from `&&` (AND) to `||` (OR), which would cause the condition to evaluate to true if either `a['abs']` is not finite or `a['arg']` is finite, leading to incorrect handling of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && !Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the check for `a['arg']`, causing the condition to evaluate to true if `a['abs']` is finite and `a['arg']` is not finite, which would incorrectly allow certain invalid complex numbers to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && !Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to require both `a['abs']` and `a['arg']`
