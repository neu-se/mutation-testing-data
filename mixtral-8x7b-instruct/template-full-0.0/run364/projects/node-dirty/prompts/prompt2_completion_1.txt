 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFileSync(this.path, 'utf-8')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the file synchronously, blocking the execution of further code, unlike the original asynchronous `createReadStream` approach.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream(path, { encoding: 'utf-8', flags: 'r' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an undefined variable `path` instead of the class property `this.path`, which might cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream(this.path, { encoding: 'base64', flags: 'r' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the encoding to 'base64' instead of 'utf-8', causing the data read from the file to be in base64 format, which might lead to issues when processing
