  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `end` was truthy, while the new code fragment always returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `end` was truthy, while the new code fragment always returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `end` was truthy, while the new code fragment always returns `0`.

DONE.
