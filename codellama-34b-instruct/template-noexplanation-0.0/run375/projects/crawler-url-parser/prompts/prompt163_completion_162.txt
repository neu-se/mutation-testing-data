  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This code fragment checks if the `linkurl_path` starts with the `pageurl_path`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This code fragment checks if the `linkurl_path` ends with the `pageurl_path`, which is also the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === -1
```
This code fragment checks if the `linkurl_path` does not contain the `pageurl_path`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

DONE.
