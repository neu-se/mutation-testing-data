Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the length of the operation, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the retention logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the length of the operation, which could lead to retaining fewer characters than intended, especially when the length is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the operation from the `otherIter` instead of the `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect transformations when merging operations from two different deltas.

DONE.
