 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is not being called, and instead, an empty function is being passed to the `then` method. This means that progress notifications will not be passed to the provided `progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is being passed instead of the `progressed` function. This would cause an error in the `then` method, as it expects a function as the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is an object and not a function. The `then` method expects a function as the third argument, so passing an object would cause an error.

DONE.
