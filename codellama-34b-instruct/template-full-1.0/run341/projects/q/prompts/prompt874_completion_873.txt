  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().fail()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the deferred.reject() method to be called immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the deferred.makeNodeResolver() method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the deferred.resolve() method to be called immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the deferred.makeNodeResolver() method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().notify(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the deferred.notify() method to be called immediately with an Error object, rather than passing it as an argument to the deferred.makeNodeResolver() method.

DONE.
