  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a string that ends with "/index.html", while the new code fragment matches a string that ends with any character followed by ".html".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches only the last occurrence of the pattern, while the new code fragment matches all occurrences of the pattern.

DONE.
