  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cosh` have different ranges and values, so the resulting calculation would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` has a different range and value than `cosh`, so the resulting calculation would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log
```
This would result in different behavior because `log` has a different range and value than `cosh`, so the resulting calculation would be incorrect.

DONE.
