  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider points with fewer than 2 coordinates as valid, which would not be the case with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider points with non-array coordinates as valid, which would not be the case with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider points with more than 2 coordinates as valid, which would not be the case with the original code.

DONE.
