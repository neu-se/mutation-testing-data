  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: false,
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `gzip` option with the `compress` method, which would result in a gzipped tar archive. By replacing it with `gzip: false`, the resulting archive would not be gzipped, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        level: 0,
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `level` option with the `gzipOptions` property, which sets the compression level to
