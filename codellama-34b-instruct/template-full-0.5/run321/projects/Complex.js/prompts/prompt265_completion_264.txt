  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is different from the original code fragment, which used the addition operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is different from the original code fragment, which used the addition operator, and the constant `c` is added to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is different from the original code fragment, which used the addition operator, and the function `Math.sqrt` is applied to the variable `b`, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
