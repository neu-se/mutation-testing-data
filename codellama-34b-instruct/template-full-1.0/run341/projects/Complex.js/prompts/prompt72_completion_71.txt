  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, while the `==` operator checks only for value equality. Since `tokens` is an array and not a number, using the `==` operator would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because we would be checking if the `tokens` array has any elements, rather than checking if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tokens.includes(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because we would be checking if the array includes the element `0`, rather than checking if it is null.

DONE.
