  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would be set to `null`, which would cause the stream to not call the `onEnd` function when the stream ends.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would be set to an empty function, which would cause the stream to not call the `onEnd` function when the stream ends.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd = function (abort) {
  if (abort) {
    console.log("Aborting stream");
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would be set to a function that logs a message to the console when the stream is aborted.

DONE.
