 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"/."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly split the path when a dot is present, potentially changing the calculated link type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new RegExp("/")
