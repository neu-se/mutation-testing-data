  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of the real parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the real parts of the two complex numbers instead of subtracting them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of subtracting them.

DONE.
