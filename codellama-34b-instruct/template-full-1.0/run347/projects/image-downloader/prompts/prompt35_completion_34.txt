  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the response data to a file, while this version pipes it to the standard output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the response data to a file, while this version pipes it to a null destination, effectively discarding the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(async (chunk) => {
  // Do nothing
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the response data to a file, while this version pipes it to an async function that does nothing, effectively ignoring the data.

DONE.
