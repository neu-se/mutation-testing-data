  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds, whereas the original code calls it immediately using `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called in the next tick of the event loop, whereas the original code calls it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, whereas the original code calls it immediately.

DONE.
