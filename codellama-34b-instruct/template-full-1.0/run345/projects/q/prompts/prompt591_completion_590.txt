  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current input instead of a result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nothing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return nothing instead of a result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a result.

DONE.
