Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument passed to the `promiseDispatch` function, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation and operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first argument of the `arguments` object, ignoring any additional operands that may be necessary for the `promiseDispatch` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to the `promiseDispatch` function, which would likely cause it to fail or behave unexpectedly, as it would not receive the expected array of arguments.

DONE.
