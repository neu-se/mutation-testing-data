 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, and it would cause the `else if` condition to always evaluate to `true`, skipping the original behavior of using the `_read` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is also a falsy value, and it would cause the `else if` condition to always evaluate to `true`, skipping the original behavior of using the `_read` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that could be assigned to `_read`, and it would cause the `if (abort)` condition to always evaluate to `true`, skipping the original behavior of using the `_read` variable.

DONE.
