  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while the new code fragment passes `null`. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the behavior of the `ninvoke` method.

DONE.
