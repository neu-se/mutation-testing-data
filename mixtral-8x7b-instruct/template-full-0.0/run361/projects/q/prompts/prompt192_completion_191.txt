 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"[object GlobalError]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the string comparison for identifying a Node.js error, potentially causing incorrect stack filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the global flag `g` is added, causing the regular expression to iterate through all matches in the input string, which may not be desired in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"anonymous function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a specific function name, which may not match the actual function name in the stack trace, causing incorrect stack filtering.

DONE.
