  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with only one argument, whereas the original code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with three arguments, whereas the original code fragment calls it with two arguments. The third argument is an empty object, which would be interpreted as a `parseOptions` object in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr, {normalizeHttps: true})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with three arguments, where the third argument is an object with the `normalizeHttps` property set to `true`. This would cause the `parse` function to normalize the protocol of the URL to HTTPS
