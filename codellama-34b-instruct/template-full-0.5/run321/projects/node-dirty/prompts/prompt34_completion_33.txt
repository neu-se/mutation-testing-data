  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `rm` method is called, the `set` method would be called with `val` set to `null`, which would cause the key to be deleted from the database, even if it was not previously present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `rm` method is called, the `set` method would be called with `val` set to `undefined`, which would cause the key to be set to `undefined` in the database, even if it was not previously present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `rm` method is called, the `set` method would be called with `val` set to `0`, which would cause the key to be set to `0` in the database, even if it was not previously present.

DONE.
