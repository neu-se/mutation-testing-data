  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `next` advances the iterator and returns the next operation. In the context of the code, `peek` would cause the iterator to remain on the same operation, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is the iterator for the other delta, and `next` would advance the iterator for the other delta, rather than the current delta. This would cause the code to skip over operations in the current delta and process operations in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta().ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Delta().ops[0]` creates a new delta with a single operation, and `next` would advance the iterator to the next operation in the new delta, rather
