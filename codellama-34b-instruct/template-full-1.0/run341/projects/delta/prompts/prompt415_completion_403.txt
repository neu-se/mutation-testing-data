  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.nextType` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation in the other iterator, whereas `thisIter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops.length - 1` would return the maximum number of operations that can be performed, whereas `thisIter.peekType` would return the type of the current operation.

DONE.
