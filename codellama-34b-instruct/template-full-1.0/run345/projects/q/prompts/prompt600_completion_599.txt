  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [op]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method on the `Q` object expects a property name as its first argument, but `op` is a variable name that is not a property of `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [op, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method on the `Q` object expects a property name and a value as its first two arguments, but `op` and `args` are variable names that do not correspond to any properties of `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [op, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method on the `Q` object expects a function name as its first argument, but `op` is a variable name that is not a function.

DONE.
