  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = next.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `next.reject` is the opposite of `next.resolve`, which means that instead of resolving the promise, it will be rejected, leading to different behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = Q.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a new promise that resolves with the given value. In this case, it would create a new promise that resolves with the `next.promise`, which would be different from the original code where the promise is resolved with the `ends.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve = Q.reject(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a new promise that rejects with the given value. In this
