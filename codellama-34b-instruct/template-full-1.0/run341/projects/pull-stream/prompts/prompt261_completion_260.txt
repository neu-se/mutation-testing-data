  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw err;
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will abort the current function and propagate the error to the caller, while `cb` will simply call the callback function with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 0, err);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` will delay the callback by 0 milliseconds, while `cb` will call the callback immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(cb, 0, err);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` will delay the callback by 0 milliseconds, while `cb` will call the callback immediately.

DONE.
