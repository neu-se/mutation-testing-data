  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `reason` parameter to be incremented, which would change the behavior of the `trackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `reason` parameter to be decremented, which would change the behavior of the `trackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `reason` parameter to be multiplied by 2, which would change the behavior of the `trackRejection` function.

DONE.
