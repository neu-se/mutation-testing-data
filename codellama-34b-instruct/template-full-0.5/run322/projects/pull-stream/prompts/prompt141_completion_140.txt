  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it will not have the same behavior as `null` when used as an argument in a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, and it will not have the same behavior as `null` when used as an argument in a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, and it will not have the same behavior as `null` when used as an argument in a function call.

DONE.
