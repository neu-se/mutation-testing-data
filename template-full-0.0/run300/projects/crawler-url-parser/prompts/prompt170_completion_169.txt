  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal. This would cause the function to return a different value if the domains are not equal, which could lead to incorrect results in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length != pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if their lengths are not equal. This would cause the function to return a different value if the domains have different lengths, which could lead to incorrect results in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.includes(pageurl.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if the domain of the link URL
