  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it may not have the same value or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different expression than `b`, and it may not have the same value or properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is a different function than `b`, and it may not have the same value or properties.

DONE.
