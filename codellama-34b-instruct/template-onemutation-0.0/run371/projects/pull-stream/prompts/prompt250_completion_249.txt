  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was called with `err` as the first argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls `cb` with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the test to pass even if there was an error.
