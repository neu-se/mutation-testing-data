  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is never used, so the loop would not iterate correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used, but it is not correctly initialized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used correctly, but the loop would iterate one more time than it should.

DONE.
