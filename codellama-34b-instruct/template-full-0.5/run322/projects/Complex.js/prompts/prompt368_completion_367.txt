  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.cos(b)`, which returns the cosine of `b`, while `Math.sin(b)` returns the sine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `b`, which is a variable, while `-b` is the negation of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `b`, which is a variable, while `b * b` is the square of `b`.

DONE.
