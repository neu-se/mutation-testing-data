  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the exception object as-is, while the replaced code fragment would throw the exception message instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some other error message"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the exception object as-is, while the replaced code fragment would throw a different error message instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw the exception object as-is, while the replaced code fragment would not throw anything at all.

DONE.
