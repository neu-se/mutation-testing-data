  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match carriage returns instead of newlines, which could cause the string to be split at the wrong places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be empty, causing the string to be split at the newline characters but not replacing them with the desired EOL character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be a space character, causing the string to be split at the newline characters and replaced with a space character, which could cause the resulting string to be different from the original.

DONE.
