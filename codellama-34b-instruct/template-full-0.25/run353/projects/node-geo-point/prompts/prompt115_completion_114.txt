  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value before calculating the sine, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the latitude value before calculating the sine, which would cause the calculation to produce a different result.

DONE.
