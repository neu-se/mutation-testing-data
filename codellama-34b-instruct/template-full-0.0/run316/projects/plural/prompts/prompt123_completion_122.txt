  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i

This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences in the input string, regardless of case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air
