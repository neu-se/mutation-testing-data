  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the equality operator `===` checks for both value and type equality, whereas the equality operator `==` only checks for value equality. In this case, if `fn` returns `null`, it would still pass the equality comparison with `null` using `==`, but it would fail with `===`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` flips the return value of `fn(key, val)`. If `fn` returns `true`, the negation operator would return `false`, and if `fn` returns `false`, the negation operator would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the return value of `fn(key, val)` is an empty array
