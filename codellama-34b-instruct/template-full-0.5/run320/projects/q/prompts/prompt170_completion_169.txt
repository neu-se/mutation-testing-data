  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the value of the `line` variable to the console, whereas the original code fragment does not have any side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = line + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the `line` variable, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the value of the `line` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `line` variable, whereas the original code fragment does not return a value.

DONE.
