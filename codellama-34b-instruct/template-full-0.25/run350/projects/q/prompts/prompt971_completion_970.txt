  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array, while `args[0]` is the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array, while `args.length` is the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `args` is an array, while `args.pop()` removes the last element of the array.

DONE.
