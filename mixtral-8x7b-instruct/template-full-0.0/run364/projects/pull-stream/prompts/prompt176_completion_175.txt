 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return an empty array instead of potentially returning the keys of a given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the values of the input object directly, instead of wrapping them in an additional array layer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(array).filter(k => array.hasOwnProperty(k))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the own properties of the input object, excluding any inherited properties.

DONE.
