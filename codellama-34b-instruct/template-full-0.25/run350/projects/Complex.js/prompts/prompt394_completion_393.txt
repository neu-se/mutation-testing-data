  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a` to calculate the complex cosh, while the replaced code fragment uses the variable `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a` to calculate the complex cosh, while the replaced code fragment uses `a + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a` to calculate the complex cosh, while the replaced code fragment uses `a * 2`.

DONE.
