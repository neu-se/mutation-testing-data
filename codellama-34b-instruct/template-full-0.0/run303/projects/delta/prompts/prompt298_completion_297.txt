  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation instead of the current operation to the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty attributes object instead of the current operation's attributes to the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the next operation instead of the current operation to the predicate function, and it would also increment the index by 1.

DONE.
