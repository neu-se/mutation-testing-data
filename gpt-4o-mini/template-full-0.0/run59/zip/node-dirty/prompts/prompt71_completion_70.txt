Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the emitted value from `0` (indicating no data loaded) to `1`, which suggests that one item has been loaded, potentially misleading the caller about the state of the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because emitting `null` instead of `0` could lead to confusion or errors in the handling of the load event, as the receiving code may not expect a null value and could fail to process it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a value that is one greater than the actual size of the data, which could mislead the caller into thinking that there is an additional item in the database that does not exist.

DONE.
