  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` method to be called with an empty array, which would return an empty array, rather than the original code fragment which uses the `arguments` object to slice the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array_slice` method to be called with a null argument, which would return a TypeError, rather than the original code fragment which uses the `arguments` object to slice the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 0 ? [] : [].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array if the `arguments` object is empty, rather than the original code fragment which uses the `arguments` object to slice the arguments.

DONE.
