  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects the first element with the class "base", while this new code fragment selects all elements with the class "base" and concatenates their text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'base' + 'base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects the first element with the class "base", while this new code fragment selects all elements with the class "base" and concatenates their text content three times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 'base' + 'base' + 'base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only selects the first element with the class "base", while this new code fragment selects all elements with the class "base" and concatenates their text content four times.

DONE.
