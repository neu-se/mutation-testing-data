  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```language-javascript
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` statement would return from the current function, whereas `throw` statement would throw an error and cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```language-javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log()` statement would log a message to the console, whereas `throw` statement would throw an error and cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```language-javascript
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because infinite loop caused by `while` statement would freeze the program, whereas `throw` statement would throw an error and cause the program to crash.

DONE.
