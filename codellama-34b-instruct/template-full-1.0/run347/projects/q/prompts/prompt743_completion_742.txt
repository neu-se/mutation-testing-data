  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which would cause the `onRejected` function to be called immediately, even if the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, which would cause the `onRejected` function to be called immediately, even if the promise is not rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(null, onRejected)` would return a new promise that is resolved with the same value as `promise`, but with a different rejection handler.

DONE.
