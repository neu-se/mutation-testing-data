  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string to uppercase, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail if the string contains any non-ASCII characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the string, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail if the string is not a valid JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the string into an array of characters, which could cause the JSON parsing to fail if the string is not a valid JSON string.

DONE.
