  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `iter.next` is a reference to the `next` method of the `iter` object, while `iter.next()` is a call to the `next` method. This would cause the code to execute the `next` method and return its result, rather than simply referencing the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `iter.next` is a reference to the `next` method of the `iter` object, while `iter.next(1)` is a call to the `next` method with an argument of `1`. This would cause the code to execute the `next` method with an argument of `1`, rather than simply referencing the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `
