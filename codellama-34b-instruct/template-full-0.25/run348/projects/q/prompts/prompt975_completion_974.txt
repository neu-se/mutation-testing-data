  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the original order of the elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the presence of that element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of the array, which could cause the code to fail if it relies on the presence of that element.

DONE.
