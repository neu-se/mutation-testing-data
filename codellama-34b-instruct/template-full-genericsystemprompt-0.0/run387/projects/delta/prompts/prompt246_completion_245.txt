  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and calling `retain` instead of `delete` would result in the inserted text being retained instead of deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and calling `insert` instead of `delete` would result in the inserted text being inserted again instead of deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` and `delete` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and calling `push` instead of `delete` would result in the inserted text being pushed onto the `Delta` object instead of deleted.

DONE.
