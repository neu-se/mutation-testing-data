  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the arguments passed to the `diff` method, which changes the output of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the first string to itself, rather than to the second string, which could potentially change the output of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].slice(1), strings[1], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it slices the first string, removing the first character, before passing it to the `diff` method, which could potentially change the output of the method.

DONE.
