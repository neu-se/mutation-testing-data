 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the internal `_data` Map, bypassing any potential caching or other behavior implemented by the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get(Math.random() * 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random key instead of using the provided `key`, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors if the randomly generated key does not exist in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get(key).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `toUpperCase` method to the value returned by `get`, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior if the value is not a string or if its case is important for the application's logic.

DONE.
