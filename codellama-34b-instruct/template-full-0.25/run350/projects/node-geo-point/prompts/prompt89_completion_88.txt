  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of the argument, while the replaced code uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of the argument. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of the argument, while the replaced code uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of the argument. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1 * cosδ - sinφ1 * sinφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cos` function, which
