  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `true` expression would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `if` statement to always be executed, regardless of the value of `currentUrlStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `false` expression would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be executed, regardless of the value of `currentUrlStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && !currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `!currentUrlStr` expression would always evaluate to `true` if `currentUrlStr` is a non-empty string, and `false`
