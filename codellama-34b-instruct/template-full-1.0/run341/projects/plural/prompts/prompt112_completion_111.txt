  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games, illnesses, misc).join('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because `.concat` returns a new array, and `+` concatenates strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tools.concat(illnesses, misc).join('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes `tools` instead of `clothes` and `games`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.join('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only includes `clothes`, and not the other arrays that are included in the original code fragment.

DONE.
