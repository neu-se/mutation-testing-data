  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` would replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, whereas `replace` would only replace the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").reverse().join("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because `split`, `reverse`, and `join` would reorder the path components in the string, whereas `replace` would only replace the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` would remove the first character of the string, whereas `replace` would only replace the pattern.

DONE.
