  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return immediately without calling the `read` function again, which would cause the loop to exit prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error immediately, which would cause the loop to exit prematurely and the `done` callback to be called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(null, function (end, data) {
  // do nothing
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return immediately without calling the `read` function again, which would cause the loop to exit prematurely.

DONE.
