  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, which would result in the `rejected` branch being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, which would result in the `rejected` branch being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, which would result in the `rejected` branch being executed.

DONE.
