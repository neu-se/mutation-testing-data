  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f(x) { return x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an object constructor that always returned a new Promise object, while this new code fragment is a function that simply returns its input argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f(x) { return x + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an object constructor that always returned a new Promise object, while this new code fragment is a function that modifies the input argument and returns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function f(x) { return x * x; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an object constructor that always returned a new Promise object, while this new code fragment is a function that modifies the input argument and returns a different value.

DONE.
