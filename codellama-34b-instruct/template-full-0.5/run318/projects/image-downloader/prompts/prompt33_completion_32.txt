  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pause` would pause the stream, whereas `res.resume` would resume it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy` would destroy the stream, whereas `res.resume` would resume it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.end` would end the stream, whereas `res.resume` would resume it.

DONE.
