  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `at` to refer to the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas the new code fragment uses the literal value `0` to refer to the first index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `at` to refer to the index of the promise in the `unhandledReasons` array, whereas the new code fragment uses the literal value `0` to refer to the first index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(unhandledReasons.length - 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `at` to refer to the index of the promise in the
