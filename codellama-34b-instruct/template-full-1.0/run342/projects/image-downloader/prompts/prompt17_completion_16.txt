  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ã€€""`
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL path would be set to an empty string, rather than the decoded basename of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL path would be set to an empty string, rather than the decoded basename of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL path would be set to the decoded basename of the URL, rather than the basename of the pathname portion of the URL.

DONE.
