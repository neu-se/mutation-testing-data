  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a built-in method that returns a string representation of an object, whereas `obj` is a variable that may or may not be an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a built-in method that returns the primitive value of an object, whereas `obj` may be a primitive value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a built-in method that checks if an object has a property with the given name, whereas `obj` may not have a `toString` property.

DONE.
