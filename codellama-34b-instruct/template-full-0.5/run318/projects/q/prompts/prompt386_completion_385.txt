  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a method that applies the callback to the resolved value, whereas `fcall` is a method that calls the callback with the resolved value as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fbind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fbind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original callback with a specific `this` value and arguments provided either explicitly or by using the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls the callback with a specific `this` value and arguments provided either explicitly or by using the `arguments` object. In this case, `null` is being passed as the `this` value, and `value` is being passed as the first argument.
