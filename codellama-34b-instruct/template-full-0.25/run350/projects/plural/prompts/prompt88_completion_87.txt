  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "person". Replacing it with `'person'` would result in the incorrect plural form "person" instead of "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "person". Replacing it with `'peoples'` would result in the incorrect plural form "peoples" instead of "people".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'people'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "person". Replacing it with `'persons'` would result in the incorrect plural form "persons" instead of "people".

DONE.
