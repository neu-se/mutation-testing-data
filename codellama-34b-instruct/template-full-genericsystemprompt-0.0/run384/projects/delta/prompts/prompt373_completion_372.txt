  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next two elements in the iterator, potentially causing the code to miss important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the iterator back one element, potentially causing the code to repeat operations or skip over important elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not move the iterator at all, potentially causing the code to get stuck in an infinite loop.

DONE.
