 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.split(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the '/' string using the `spec` as the separator, instead of splitting `spec` using '/' as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.concat(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates '/' to the beginning of `spec`, instead of splitting `spec` using '/' as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.repeat(spec.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a string with `spec.length` number of '/' characters, instead of splitting `spec` using '/' as the separator.

These changes would result in different behavior because they do not correctly split the `spec` string using '/' as the separator, which is required to correctly parse the path specification. DONE.
