Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to proceed without throwing an error when the embed types do not match, potentially leading to unexpected behavior later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the embed types match, which is the opposite of the intended logic, causing the function to fail when it should succeed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the embed type is null, which is not a valid check in this context, potentially leading to a runtime error when valid objects are passed in.

DONE.
