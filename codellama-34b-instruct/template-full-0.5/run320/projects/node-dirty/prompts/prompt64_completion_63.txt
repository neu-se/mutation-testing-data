  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` will immediately close the stream and destroy any data that has not been written to it, whereas `end()` will finish writing any remaining data before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` will write an empty string to the stream, whereas `end()` will finish writing any remaining data before closing the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` will prevent any further data from being written to the stream, whereas `end()` will finish writing any remaining data before closing the stream.

DONE.
