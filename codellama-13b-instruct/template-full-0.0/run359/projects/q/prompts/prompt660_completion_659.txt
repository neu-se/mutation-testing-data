  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute the `dispatch` method on the current object, rather than the `dispatch` method on the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute the `dispatch` method on the `Q` object, rather than the `dispatch` method on the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to execute the `dispatch` method on the current object, but with the `this` context bound to the current object. This would allow the `dispatch` method to access the current object's properties and methods, rather than the `Promise` object's properties and methods.

DONE.
