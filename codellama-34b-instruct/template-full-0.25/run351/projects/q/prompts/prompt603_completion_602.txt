  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with a function argument, which would cause the function to be executed immediately instead of being deferred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is called with a null argument, which would cause the function to be executed immediately instead of being deferred.

DONE.
