  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end && false)` instead of `!end`. This would cause the `once` function to be called with a truthy value instead of a falsy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `onEnd` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end || true)` instead of `!end`. This would cause the `once` function to be called with a truthy value instead of a falsy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `onEnd` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator
