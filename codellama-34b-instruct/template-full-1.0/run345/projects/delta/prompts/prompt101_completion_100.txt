  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.shift` would shift the first element off the `this.ops` array, whereas `this.ops.pop` would pop the last element off the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.unshift` would add the element to the beginning of the `this.ops` array, whereas `this.ops.pop` would add the element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.splice(0, 1)` would remove the first element of the `this.ops` array, whereas `this.ops.pop` would remove the last element.

DONE.
