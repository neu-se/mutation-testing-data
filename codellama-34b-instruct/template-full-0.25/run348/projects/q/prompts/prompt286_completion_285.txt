  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the operand is a function, while the `!==` operator checks if the operand is not equal to the given value. In this case, the code would still check if `resolver` is a function, but it would do so using a different operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== typeof function
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks if the operand is a function, while the `!==` operator checks if the operand is not equal to the given value. In this case, the code would check if `resolver` is not equal to the type of a function, which would always be true since `resolver` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function" && typeof resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would
