  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to always return "internal" for links on the same domain, regardless of the subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.includes(pageurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "internal" for links on the same domain or a subdomain of the page's domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.startsWith(pageurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "internal" for links on the same domain or a subdomain of the page's domain, but only if the link's host starts with the page's host.

DONE.
