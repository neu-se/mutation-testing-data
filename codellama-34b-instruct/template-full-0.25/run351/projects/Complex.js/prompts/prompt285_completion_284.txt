  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the cosh function to return the opposite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the cos function would return the cosine of the angle, rather than the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the Math.cosh function would return the hyperbolic cosine of the angle, rather than the cosine.

DONE.
