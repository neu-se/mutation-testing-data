  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the index, regardless of the length of the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, which would cause the slice to start at the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the index, which would cause the slice to end at the wrong position.

DONE.
