  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is a variable that holds the accumulated value of the reduction, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the reduction is complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a constant value that is not a function, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the reduction is complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a constant value that is not a function, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the reduction is complete.

DONE.
