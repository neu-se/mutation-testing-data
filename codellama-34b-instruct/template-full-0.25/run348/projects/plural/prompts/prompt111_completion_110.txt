```

```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to handle words that end in "y" correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to handle words that end in "x" or "s" correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not be able to handle words that end in "y" or "x" or "s" correctly.

DONE.
