Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `query` method of the `rule` instead of the `clone` method, which would not create a copy of the rule but instead evaluate a query, potentially leading to incorrect policy behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of cloning the rule would mean that the cloned policy would not contain any rules, effectively making it an empty policy, which changes the intended functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `matches` method of the `rule` instead of the `clone` method, which would not create a new instance of the rule but instead check if the rule matches a certain path, leading to unexpected results in the cloned policy.

DONE.
