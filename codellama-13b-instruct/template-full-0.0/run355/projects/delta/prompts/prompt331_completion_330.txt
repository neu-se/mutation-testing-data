  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOp.insert` property is a string, while the original code fragment `baseOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a specific type of object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOp.attributes` property is an object, while the original code fragment `baseOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a specific type of object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseOp.retain` property is an object, while the original code fragment `baseOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the code is expecting a specific type of object.

DONE.
