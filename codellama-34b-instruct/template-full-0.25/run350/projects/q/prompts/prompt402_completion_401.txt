  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error object instead of the original reason, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason instead of throwing an error, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled with the reason instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined instead of throwing an error or returning the reason, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled with undefined instead of being rejected.

DONE.
