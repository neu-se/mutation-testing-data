  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first string to itself, which would always result in an empty diff.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first string to the third string, which could result in a non-empty diff if the third string is different from the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the first string to the length of the second string, which could result in a non-empty diff if the lengths are different.

DONE.
