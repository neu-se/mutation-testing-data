  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex['NAN']` when both operands are infinite, instead of `Complex['INFINITY']` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when either operand is infinite, instead of `Complex['NAN']` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `add` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the first operand is infinite and the second operand is not, instead of `
