  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `exception` object would be returned, rather than the `exception` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Error` object would be created with the `exception` object as its message, rather than returning the `exception` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the `exception` object would be called, which would return a string representation of the `exception` object, rather than returning the `exception` object itself.

DONE.
