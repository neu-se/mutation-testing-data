  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `>=` operator, which checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length, while the new code fragment uses the `>` operator, which checks if the index is strictly greater than the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `>=` operator, which checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length, while the new code fragment uses the `<=` operator, which checks if the index is less than or equal to the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `>=` operator, which checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length, while the new code fragment uses the `==` operator, which checks if the index is equal to the length.

DONE.
