  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to iterate over the `verbs` array, while this new code fragment only accesses the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to iterate over the `verbs` array, while this new code fragment removes the last element of the array and assigns it to `verb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to iterate over the `verbs` array, while this new code fragment removes the first element of the array and assigns it to `verb`.

DONE.
