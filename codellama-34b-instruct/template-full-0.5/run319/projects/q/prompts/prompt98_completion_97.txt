  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, potentially causing the code to access different array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, potentially causing the code to miss important values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = length - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, potentially causing the code to access different array elements.

DONE.
