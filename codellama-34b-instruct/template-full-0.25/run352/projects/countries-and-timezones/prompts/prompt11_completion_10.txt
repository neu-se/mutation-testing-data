  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the existing object with the new properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = Object.assign({}, result[country], { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the existing properties of `result[country]` and the new properties, instead of modifying the existing object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { ...result[country], [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the existing properties of `result[country]` and the new properties, instead of modifying the existing object.

DONE.
