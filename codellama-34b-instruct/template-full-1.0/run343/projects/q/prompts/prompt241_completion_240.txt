  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isThenable
```
This would result in different behavior because `isThenable` checks for the presence of a `then` method, which is a more general check than `isPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is always truthy, so the branch that coerces a promise would never be taken.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is falsy, so the branch that coerces a promise would always be taken.

DONE.
