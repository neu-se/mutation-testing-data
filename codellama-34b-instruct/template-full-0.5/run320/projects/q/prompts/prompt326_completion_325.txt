  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the operation name, which would likely cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always convert the operation name to lowercase, which could cause the promise to be rejected if the operation name is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reverse the operation name, which could cause the promise to be rejected if the operation name is case-sensitive.

DONE.
