  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, and the `peekLength` method is not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, and the `peekLength` method is not called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called, but the result is increased by 1.

DONE.
