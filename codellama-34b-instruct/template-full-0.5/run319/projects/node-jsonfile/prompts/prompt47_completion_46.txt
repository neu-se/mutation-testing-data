  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a file path as a string, while the replacement code fragment would convert the file path to uppercase, potentially causing the file to not be found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a file path as a string, while the replacement code fragment would remove the first character of the file path, potentially causing the file to not be found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a file path as a string, while the replacement code fragment would add the '.txt' extension to the file path, potentially causing the file to not be found.

DONE.
