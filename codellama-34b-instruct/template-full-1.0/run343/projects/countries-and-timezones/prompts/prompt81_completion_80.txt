  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` and `map` are both methods for iterating over arrays, but they have different return values and side effects. `forEach` executes the provided function for each element in the array, but does not return a new array as `map` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(values).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the own enumerable string keyed properties of an object, while `values` is a reference to the `values` array provided as a parameter to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.entries().map
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` returns an iterator for the entries (key/value pairs) of the array, while `values` returns an array of the values of the array.

DONE.
