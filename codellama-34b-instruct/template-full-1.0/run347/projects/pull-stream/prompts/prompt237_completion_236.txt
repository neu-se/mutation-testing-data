  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` function as a callback to the `tester` function, whereas the new code fragment passes the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` function as a callback to the `tester` function, whereas the new code fragment passes the `end` variable as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `cb` function as a callback to the `tester` function, whereas the new code fragment passes the `data` variable as a callback.

DONE.
