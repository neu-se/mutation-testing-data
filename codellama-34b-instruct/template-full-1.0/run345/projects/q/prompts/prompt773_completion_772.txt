  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'any'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function is not implemented in the current code, and adding it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that resolves to the value of the first resolved promise, instead of a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'all'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is not implemented in the current code, and adding it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, instead of a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'reject'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is not implemented in the current code, and adding it would cause the `allResolved` function to return a rejected promise, instead of a resolved promise.

DONE.
