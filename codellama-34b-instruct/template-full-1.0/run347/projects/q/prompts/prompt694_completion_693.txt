  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function, but `Q.promise` is not a function, so the code would fail to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that creates a deferred object, but the code expects a promise object, so the code would fail to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a resolved promise, but the code expects a deferred object, so the code would fail to execute.

DONE.
