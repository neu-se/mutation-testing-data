  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(+fileNameAndLineNumber)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array, and using the unary `+` operator on an array will return the number of elements in the array. This change would ensure that the `if` statement always evaluates to `true`, making the promise resolution fail regardless of the value of `messages`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
([] + fileNameAndLineNumber)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[] + fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array concatenation operation that returns `undefined`. This change would ensure that the `if` statement always evaluates to `false`, making the promise resolution succeed regardless of the value of `messages`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(fileNameAndLineNumber.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an integer value to the `if` statement, which would evaluate to `true` only if the length of the
