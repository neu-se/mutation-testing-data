  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this new code checks if `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`. If `a` is negative, the original code would return `true`, while this new code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while this new code checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`. If `a` is negative, the original code would return `false`, while this new code would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
