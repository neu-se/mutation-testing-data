  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `deprecated` property of the `options` object is true, instead of simply returning the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && options.deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `deprecated` property of the `options` object is true, and if it is, it would return the `options` object. If `options` is null or undefined, it would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...options, deprecated: options.deprecated === true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same properties as the `options` object, but with the `deprecated` property set to true if it was true in the original object.

DONE.
