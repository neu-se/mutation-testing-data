  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to throw an error, which would in turn cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
