Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` would change the value being passed to the `apply` method, potentially leading to unexpected results if the function being called relies on the context of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` as the context for the `apply` method would bind the function to the current execution context, which may not be the intended behavior if the function is designed to operate on a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because while `undefined` and `void 0` are often treated the same in JavaScript, explicitly using `undefined` could lead to differences in how certain functions handle the context or parameters, especially in strict mode.

DONE.
