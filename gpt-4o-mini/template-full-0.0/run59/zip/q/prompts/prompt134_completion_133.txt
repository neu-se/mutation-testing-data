Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks specifically if the value is `null`, whereas the original code checks if the value is an object, which would return `false` for `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is a string, which would return `false` for all non-string values, including objects, whereas the original code checks if the value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is an array, which would return `false` for all non-array objects, while the original code checks if the value is a generic object.

DONE.
