  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `callback.fcall()` to call the `fcall` method on the `callback` object, while the modified code fragment uses `callback.fcall().then(function () { return value; })` to call the `fcall` method on the `callback` object and then chain a `then` method to it. The `then` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it will throw an error.

DONE.
