  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ZERO'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['ZERO']` is always zero, whereas `this['im']` may or may not be zero, depending on the specific instance of the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re']` is the real part of the complex number, whereas `this['im']` is the imaginary part. By using `this['re']` instead of `this['im']`, the code would be computing the rounding of the real part instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), whereas `this['im'] * places` computes the
