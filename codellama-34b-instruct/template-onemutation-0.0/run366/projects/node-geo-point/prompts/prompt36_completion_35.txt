  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range and output than the `cos` function. The `sin` function returns a value between -1 and 1, while the `cos` function returns a value between 0 and 1. This change would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
