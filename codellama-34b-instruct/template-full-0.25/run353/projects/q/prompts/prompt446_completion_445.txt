  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `pop()` would remove the last reported unhandled rejection, which could cause the rejection to be missed by the error handling mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push()` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, `shift()` would remove the first reported unhandled rejection, which could cause the rejection to be missed by the error handling mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes the first element of
