  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to create an HTTPS protocol URL instead of HTTP, which could result in an error or unexpected behavior if the URL is not supported by the protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to create an empty URL, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to create a null URL, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
