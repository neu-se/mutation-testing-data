  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the `hasStacks` variable to be evaluated even if `Q.longStackSupport` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the `Q.longStackSupport` expression, which would cause the `hasStacks` variable to be evaluated only if `Q.longStackSupport` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport ? hasStacks : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator is used to conditionally evaluate the `hasStacks` variable based on the value of `Q.longStackSupport`. If `Q.longStackSupport` is truthy,
