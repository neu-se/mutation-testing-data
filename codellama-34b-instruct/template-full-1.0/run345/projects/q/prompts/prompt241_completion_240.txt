  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isError
```
This would result in different behavior because `isError` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the given value is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the given value is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the given value is a fulfilled promise. The `!` operator would invert the result of `isFulfilled`, causing the condition to be entered only if the promise is not fulfilled.

DONE.
