  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the rejected promise, while the buggy code fragment returns the fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the rejected promise, while the buggy code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the rejected promise, while the buggy code fragment throws an error.

DONE.
