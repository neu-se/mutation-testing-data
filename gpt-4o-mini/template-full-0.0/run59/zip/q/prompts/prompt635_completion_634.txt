Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the intended `object` would cause the `dispatch` method to operate on a null reference, likely resulting in a runtime error or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the intended `object` would lead to similar issues as with `null`, potentially causing the `dispatch` method to fail when it attempts to access properties or methods on an undefined reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of the intended `object` would cause the `dispatch` method to treat the string as an object, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to perform operations that are not valid for string types.

DONE.
