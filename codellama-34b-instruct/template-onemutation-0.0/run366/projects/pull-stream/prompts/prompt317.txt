Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

//read a number of items and then stop.
module.exports = function take (test, opts) {
  opts = opts || {}
  var last = opts.last || false // whether the first item for which !test(item) should still pass
  var ended = false
  if('number' === typeof test) {
    last = true
    var n = test; test = function () {
      return --n
    }
  }

  return function (read) {

    function terminate (cb) {
      read(true, function (err) {
        last = false; cb(err || true)
      })
    }

    return function (end, cb) {
      if(ended && !end) last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)
      else if(ended = end) read(ended, cb)
      else
        read(null, function (end, data) {
          if(ended = ended || end) {
            //last ? terminate(cb) :
            cb(ended)
          }
          else if(!test(data)) {
            ended = true
            last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(<PLACEHOLDER>)
          }
          else
            cb(null, data)
        })
    }
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
cb
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
