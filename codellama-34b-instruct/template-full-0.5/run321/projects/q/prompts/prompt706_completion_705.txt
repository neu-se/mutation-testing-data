  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat` returns a new array containing the values of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `concat` concatenates the arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `concat` concatenates the arrays.

DONE.
