  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continue
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continue` statement would cause the loop to skip to the next iteration, potentially skipping over necessary data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
break
```
This would result in different behavior because the `break` statement would cause the loop to exit immediately, potentially missing necessary data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the data to the console, but would not modify the returned data.

DONE.
