  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the result of `fapply`, which is a promise, instead of being called on the original promise `Q(callback)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the result of `fapply`, which is a promise, instead of being called on the original promise `Q(callback)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fin(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fin` method is called on the result of `fapply`, which is a promise, instead of being called on the original promise `Q(callback)`.

DONE.
