  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `retain` property of `otherOp`, which would not be equivalent to comparing the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `insert` property of `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `delete` property of `otherOp`, which would not be equivalent to comparing the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `insert` property of `otherOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `delete` property of `thisOp` with the `retain` property of `otherOp`, which would
