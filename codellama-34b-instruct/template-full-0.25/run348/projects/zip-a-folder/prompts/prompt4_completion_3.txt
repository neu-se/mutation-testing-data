  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be different, and the resulting archive would have a different size and compression ratio.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be the same as the original code, and the resulting archive would have the same size and compression ratio.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be different, and the resulting archive would have a different size and compression ratio.

DONE.
