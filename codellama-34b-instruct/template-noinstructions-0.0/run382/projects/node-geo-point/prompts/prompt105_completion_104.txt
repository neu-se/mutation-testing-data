  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result to be off by one tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result to be off by one tile in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result to be twice as large, resulting in a different tile.

DONE.
