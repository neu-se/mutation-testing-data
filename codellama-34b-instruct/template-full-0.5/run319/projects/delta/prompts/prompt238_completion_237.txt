  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of its arguments, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length of the other iterator's next operation from the total length, rather than taking the minimum of the two lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the total length from the length of the other iterator's next operation, rather than taking the minimum of the two lengths.

DONE.
