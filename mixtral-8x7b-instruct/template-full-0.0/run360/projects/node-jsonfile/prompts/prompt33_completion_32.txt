 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writeFile` function is now synchronous, which can cause issues in an asynchronous context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is used to convert a Node.js-style callback API to a Promise-based API, but `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function, so this would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.appendFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.appendFile` is used to append data to a file, rather than overwriting the file like `fs.writeFile` does.

DONE.
