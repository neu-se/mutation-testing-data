  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the object, and adding 1 to it would change the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the object, and subtracting 1 from it would change the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable is used to determine the operation to be performed on the object, and multiplying it by 2 would change the operation.

DONE.
