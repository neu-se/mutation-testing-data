Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increment the base index by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping over an operation in the base slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the base index, leading to incorrect slicing of the base operations and potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + op.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `op.retain` object instead of a constant increment, which could lead to an incorrect index calculation based on the structure of the `op` object rather than a simple increment.

DONE.
