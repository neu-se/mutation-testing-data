  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and adding 1 to a function would not have the same effect as calling the function with the argument `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and accessing its `source` property would not have the same effect as calling the function with the argument `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, and calling its `source` method would not have the same effect as calling the function with the argument `read`.

DONE.
