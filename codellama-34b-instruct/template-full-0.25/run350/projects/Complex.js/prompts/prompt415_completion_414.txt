  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs()` returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
