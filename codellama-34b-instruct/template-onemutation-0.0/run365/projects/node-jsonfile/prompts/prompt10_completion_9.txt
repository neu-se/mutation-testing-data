  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `options.reviver` function as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`, while the new code fragment uses `null` as the second argument. This could cause the `JSON.parse()` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results in the code that uses the `jsonfile` module.

DONE.
