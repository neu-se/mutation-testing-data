  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is thrown, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
