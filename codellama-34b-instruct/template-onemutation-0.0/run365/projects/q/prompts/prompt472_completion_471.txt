  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes the element at a specific index. In this case, `pop()` would remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
