  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `z` is equal to zero, while this replacement is checking if the imaginary part of `z` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the real part of `z` is equal to zero, while this replacement is checking if the imaginary part of `z` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the real part of `z` is not equal to zero, while this replacement is checking if the imaginary part of `z` is not equal to zero.

DONE.
