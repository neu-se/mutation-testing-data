  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only `error` to `onUnhandledError`, which is not the intended behavior.The `onUnhandledError` function is intended to handle both the `error` and `promise` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only `promise` to `onUnhandledError`, which is not the intended behavior. The `onUnhandledError` function is intended to handle both the `error` and `promise` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all three arguments to `onUnhandledError`, which is not the intended behavior. The `onUnhandledError` function is intended to handle only the `error` and `promise` arguments.

DONE.
