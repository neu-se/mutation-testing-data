  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer subtract 2 from the length of the word, but rather subtract 1. This would cause the code to return the wrong plural form for some words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer subtract 2 from the length of the word, but rather subtract 3. This would cause the code to return the wrong plural form for some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer subtract 2 from the length of the word, but rather subtract 4. This would cause the code to return the wrong plural form for some words.

DONE.
