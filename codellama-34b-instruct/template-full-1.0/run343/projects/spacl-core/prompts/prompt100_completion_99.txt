  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"path" + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `path` is a string, while the replacement code fragment `"path" + Math.random()` is a concatenation of a string and a random number, which produces a different value each time it is evaluated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `path` is a string, while the replacement code fragment `path[1]` is a string that refers to the second character of the string "path".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.indexOf(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `path` is a string, while the replacement code fragment `path.indexOf(path)` is a number that represents the position of the "path" string within itself, or -1 if it is not found.

DONE.
