  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation. Using `peekLength` instead of `peekType` would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a retain operation, as it would return the length of the retain operation instead of the type.

DONE.
