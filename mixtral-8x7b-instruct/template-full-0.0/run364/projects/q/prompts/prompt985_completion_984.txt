 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to a specific object, which might not have the same context as the original `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype` is used to define properties for instances of an object, not for the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `dispatch` method with an empty function if it's not defined, which might not have the same behavior as the original method.

DONE.
