  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would return a new node resolver, whereas `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
