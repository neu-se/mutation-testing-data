  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would return a string encoded in UTF-16 instead of UTF-8, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that assumes UTF-8 encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would return a string encoded in ASCII instead of UTF-8, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that assumes UTF-8 encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base64'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Buffer.toString()` method would return a string encoded in base64 instead of UTF-8, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that assumes UTF-8 encoding.

DONE.
