  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This will cause the code to calculate the square root of the result of the multiplication, which will give a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This will cause the code to calculate the logarithm of the result of the multiplication, which will give a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This will cause the code to calculate the sine of the result of the multiplication, which will give a different value than the original code.

DONE.
