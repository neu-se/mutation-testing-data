  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context, which would cause the error to be thrown in the global scope rather than the `process.domain` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(process.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context, which would cause the error to be thrown in the `process.domain` context rather than the global scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(process.domain, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context and arguments, which would cause the error to be thrown in the `process.domain` context with the `error` object as an argument, rather than the global scope with no arguments.

DONE.
