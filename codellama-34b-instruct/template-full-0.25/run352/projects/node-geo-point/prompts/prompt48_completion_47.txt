  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of `φ2` twice, which would cause the `calculateBearing` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the degree value of `φ2` twice, which would cause the `calculateBearing` function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different constant to convert degrees to radians, which would cause the `calculateBearing` function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
