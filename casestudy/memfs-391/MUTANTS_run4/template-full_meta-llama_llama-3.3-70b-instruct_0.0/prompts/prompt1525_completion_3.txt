Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathToFilename(path) + 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the file mode from 'r' (read-only) to 'w' (write-only), potentially allowing unwanted modifications to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'invalid_path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an invalid file path to the `openSync` method, which would likely throw an error, whereas the original code passed a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.root.getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the path of the root directory instead of the specified file path, potentially affecting the functionality of the `utimesBase` method.

DONE.
