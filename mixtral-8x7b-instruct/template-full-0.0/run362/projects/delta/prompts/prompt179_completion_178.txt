 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an object, even if there is no next operation. This could cause issues if the following code expects a specific type or properties from the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the current operation without advancing the iterator, which could cause an infinite loop if the following code expects a new operation on each call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.hasNext() ? thisIter.next() : {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object when there is no next operation, which could cause issues if the following code expects a specific type or properties from the returned value.

DONE.
