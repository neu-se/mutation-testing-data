  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest(0)` would return an empty array, causing the `concat` method to return an empty delta, whereas the original code would return a delta containing the remaining ops in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest(0)` would return an empty array, causing the `concat` method to return an empty delta, whereas the original code would return a delta containing the remaining ops in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest(1)` would return an array containing the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas the original code would return an empty array.

DONE.
