  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `reject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred instance, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `defer` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled with the result of the callback function when the promise is resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `then` method.

DONE.
