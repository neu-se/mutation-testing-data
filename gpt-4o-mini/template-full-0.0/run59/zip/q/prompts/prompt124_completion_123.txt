Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `true` for properties that do not exist on the object, effectively reversing the logic of checking for the existence of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== 'someKey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will exclude a specific key ('someKey') from being considered as an own property, potentially leading to incorrect results when that key is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || key in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `true` if the property exists either as an own property or as an inherited property, which changes the intended check for only own properties.

DONE.
