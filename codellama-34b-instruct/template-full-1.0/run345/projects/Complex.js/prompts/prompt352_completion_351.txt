  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a reciprocal of b, while the new code fragment would return a reciprocal of (b + 1).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a subtraction of two numbers, while the new code fragment would return a square root of b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a fraction of (Math.PI, 0), while the new code fragment would return a fraction of (1, 0).

DONE.
