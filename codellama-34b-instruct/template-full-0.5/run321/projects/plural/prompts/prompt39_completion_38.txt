  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last three characters instead of the last two, resulting in a different output for words like "appendix".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add "es" to the end of the word instead of "ices", resulting in a different output for words like "appendix".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add "ices" to the end of the word instead of "es", resulting in a different output for words like "appendix".

DONE.
