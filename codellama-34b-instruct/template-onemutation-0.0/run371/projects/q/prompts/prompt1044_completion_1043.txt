  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was getting the "head" property of the promise, while the new code fragment is getting the "tail" property. This could cause the `get` method to return a different value than expected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Queue` class.

DONE.
