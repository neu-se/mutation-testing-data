  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to always return `null`, regardless of whether the policy exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name).query
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to always return the result of the `query` method of the policy, regardless of whether the policy exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name) || this.get(name).query
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return the result of the `query` method of the policy if the policy exists, or `null` if the policy does not exist.

DONE.
