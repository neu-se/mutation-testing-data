  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` method would not invoke the callback function `cb` even if the key exists in the database, as `null` is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` method would not update the value stored at key in the database, as `{}` is an empty object and has no properties, and therefore cannot be used to update a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` method would not invoke the callback function `cb` even if the key exists in the database, as `() => {}` is a function with no statements and therefore cannot update the value at the key.

DONE.
