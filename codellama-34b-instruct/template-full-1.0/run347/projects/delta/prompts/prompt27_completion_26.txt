  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all the keys in the object, whereas the original code fragment returned the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all the values in the object, whereas the original code fragment returned the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of all the entries (key-value pairs) in the object, whereas the original code fragment returned the object itself.

DONE.
