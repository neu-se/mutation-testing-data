  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this[index]` would return `undefined` if the property is not defined, whereas `index in this` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is an own property of the object, whereas `in` checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is an own property of the object, whereas `in` checks if the property exists in the object or its prototype chain.

DONE.
