  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error synchronously, while this replacement re-throws it asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error with the original message, while this replacement re-throws it with a new message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e.message;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment re-throws the error with the original message, while this replacement re-throws it with the message of the original error.

DONE.
