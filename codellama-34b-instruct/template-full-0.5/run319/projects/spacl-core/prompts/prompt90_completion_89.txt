  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `policy` variable to be reassigned on each iteration of the loop, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `policy` variable to be reassigned on each iteration of the loop, potentially leading to unexpected results.
