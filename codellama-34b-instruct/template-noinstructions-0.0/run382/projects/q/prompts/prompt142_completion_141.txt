  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `source` property of a promise, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `source` property of a promise, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !!p; p = p.source.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not defined on the `source` property of a promise, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
