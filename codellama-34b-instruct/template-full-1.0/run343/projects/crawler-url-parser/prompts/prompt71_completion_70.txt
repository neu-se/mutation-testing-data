  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, while the original code fragment would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort` method would sort the elements of the array in ascending order, while the original code fragment would not modify the order of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would reverse the order of the elements in the array, while the original code fragment would not modify the order of the array.

DONE.
