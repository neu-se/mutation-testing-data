  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the substring, while this new code fragment would use the index of the first character of the word as the starting point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the substring, while this new code fragment would use the index of the last character of the word as the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the substring, while this new code fragment would use the length of the word minus one as the starting point.

DONE.
