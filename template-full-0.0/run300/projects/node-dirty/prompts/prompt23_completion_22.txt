  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', this); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', {}); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

DONE.
