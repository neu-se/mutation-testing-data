Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array when there are still operations left to iterate over, instead of returning the remaining operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index === this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current index is equal to the length of the operations array, which would incorrectly indicate that there are no more operations to process even if there are remaining operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array if there is any offset, which would not accurately reflect whether there are remaining operations to iterate over.

DONE.
