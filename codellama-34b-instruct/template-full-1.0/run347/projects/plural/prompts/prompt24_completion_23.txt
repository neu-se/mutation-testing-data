  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|fungus|cactus|focus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is called with a different length argument, which would cause the returned string to be different in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|fungus|cactus|focus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is called with a different length argument, which would cause the returned string to be different in some cases.
