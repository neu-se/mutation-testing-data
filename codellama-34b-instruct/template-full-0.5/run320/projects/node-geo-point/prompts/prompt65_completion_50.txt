  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Δλ = deg2rad(point2.longitude) - deg2rad(point1.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is applied to `point2.longitude` instead of `point2.latitude`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Δλ = deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction is reversed, causing the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Δλ = rad2deg(point2.longitude) - rad2deg(point1.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is applied to `point2.longitude` instead of `point2.latitude`, which
