  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from the default `\n` to `\r\n`, which is the Windows newline character. This could cause issues with compatibility with other systems that use different newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from the default `\n` to `\r`, which is the MacOS newline character. This could cause issues with compatibility with other systems that use different newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character from the default `\n` to `\n\r`, which is the newline character used by some older MacOS systems. This could cause issues with compatibility with other systems that use different newline characters.

DONE.
