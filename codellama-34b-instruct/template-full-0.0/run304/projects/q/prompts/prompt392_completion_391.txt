  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the functions are not designed to handle the arguments in the correct order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the list, which could cause issues if the functions are not designed to handle the extra argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the list, which could cause issues if the functions are not designed to handle the extra argument.

DONE.
