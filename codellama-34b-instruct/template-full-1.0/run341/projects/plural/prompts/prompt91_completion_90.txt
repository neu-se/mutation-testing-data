  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the suffix for the plural of chilli is -es, not -s.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word chillis is not a recognized plural form of the word chilli.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilliw'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word chilliw is not a recognized plural form of the word chilli.

DONE.
