  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not reject the promise if the `callback` argument is undefined, but this modified code fragment would reject the promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise if the `callback` argument is undefined, but this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not notify the promise if the `callback` argument is undefined, but this modified code fragment would notify the promise with the `callback` function.

DONE.
