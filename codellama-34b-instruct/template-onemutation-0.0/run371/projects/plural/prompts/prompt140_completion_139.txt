  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` array contains pairs of regular expressions and replacement strings, and the first element of each pair is a regular expression that is used to match the input word. By replacing `rule[0]` with `rule[1]`, the regular expression is no longer used to match the input word, and the replacement string is used instead. This would cause the `plural` function to return a different result for the input word, which would indicate a bug in the test suite.

DONE.
