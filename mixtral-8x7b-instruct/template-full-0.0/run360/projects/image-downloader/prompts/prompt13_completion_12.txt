 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
encodeURIComponent
```
This would result in different behavior because encodeURIComponent encodes special characters, while decodeURIComponent decodes them. In this context, it would result in an invalid filename being used as the `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be assigned to `decodedBasename`, which would then be used as the filename. This would result in an invalid filename being used as the `options.dest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random string would be assigned to `decodedBasename`, which would then be used as the filename. This would result in an unpredictable filename being used as the `options.dest`.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate how well the test suite covers the code and detects unexpected behavior. DONE.
