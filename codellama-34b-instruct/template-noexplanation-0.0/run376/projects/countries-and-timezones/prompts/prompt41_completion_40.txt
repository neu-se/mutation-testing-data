  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return a different value than the original code, which is likely to break the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This change will also cause the `reduce` method to return a different value than the original code, which is likely to break the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return a different value than the original code, which is likely to break the test suite.

DONE.
