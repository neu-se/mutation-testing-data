  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0.5 * (λ1 + λ2) - Math.PI / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating θ has been changed to use λ1 + λ2 instead of λ2 - λ1. This would cause the calculation to return a different result for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return -Math.PI * (λ1 - λ2) / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating θ has been changed to use -Math.PI \* λ1 + Math.PI \* λ2. This would cause the calculation to return a different result for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return λ2 - λ1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the formula for calculating θ has been changed to simply return λ2 - λ1. This would cause the calculation to
