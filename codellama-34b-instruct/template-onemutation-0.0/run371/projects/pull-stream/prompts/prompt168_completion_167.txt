  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function reference, while the new code fragment `onAbort()` is a function call. The function call would execute the function immediately, whereas the function reference would only be executed when the `abortCb` function is called.

DONE.
