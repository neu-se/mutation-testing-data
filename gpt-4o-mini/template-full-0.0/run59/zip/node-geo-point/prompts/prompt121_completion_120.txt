Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0; 
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a bearing of 0 degrees, regardless of the actual points provided, which is incorrect for calculating the bearing between two geographical points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 180 - GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite bearing instead of the correct bearing, effectively inverting the direction, which is not the intended calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the bearing, which could lead to incorrect results when the bearing is negative, as it would not represent the actual directional angle.

DONE.
