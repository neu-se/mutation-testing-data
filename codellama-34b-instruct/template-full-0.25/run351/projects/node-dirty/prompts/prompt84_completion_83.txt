  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from Unix-style (`\n`) to Windows-style (`\r\n`). This could cause issues with compatibility with other systems that expect Unix-style line endings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from Unix-style (`\n`) to Mac-style (`\r`). This could cause issues with compatibility with other systems that expect Unix-style line endings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line ending from Unix-style (`\n`) to a space character. This could cause issues with compatibility with other systems that expect Unix-style line endings.

DONE.
