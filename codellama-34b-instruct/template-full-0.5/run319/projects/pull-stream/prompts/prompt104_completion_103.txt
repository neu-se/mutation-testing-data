  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to the current object, whereas `drain` on its own would not have any specific binding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain.call(this)` would call the `drain` function with the current object as the `this` value, whereas `drain` on its own would not have any specific `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `drain.apply(this)` would call the `drain` function with the current object as the `this` value and an empty argument list, whereas `drain` on its own would not have any specific `this` value or argument list.

DONE.
