Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, which is the opposite of what `decodeURI` does, potentially leading to incorrect URL handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape
```
This would result in different behavior because `unescape` is already used earlier in the code, but in this context, it would be applied twice, potentially causing incorrect unescaping of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(url) { return url; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function simply returns the original URL without any decoding, potentially leading to issues with URLs that contain special characters.

DONE.
