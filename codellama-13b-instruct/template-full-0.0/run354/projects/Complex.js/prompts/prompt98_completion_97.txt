  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking for the presence of the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I". This could potentially cause the code to fail if the input string contains the letter "j" or "J", but not "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking for the presence of either "i", "I", "j", or "J" in the input string. This could potentially cause the code to fail if the input string contains any of these letters, but not all of them.

Option 3: The
