  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws the `reason` object, while this replacement returns it instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason.message; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws the `reason` object, while this replacement returns its `message` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws the `reason` object, while this replacement returns `undefined`.

DONE.
