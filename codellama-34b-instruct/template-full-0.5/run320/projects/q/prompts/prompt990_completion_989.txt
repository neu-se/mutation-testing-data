  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the function, while `args.length` is a number representing the length of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the function, while `args[0]` is the first element of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the function, while `args.slice(1)` is a new array containing all the elements of `args` except the first one.

DONE.
