 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Buggy timeout"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the timeout from being properly handled, causing the promise to reject immediately instead of waiting for the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be immediately resolved, bypassing the timeout mechanism entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject("Buggy rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be immediately rejected with a custom error message, bypassing the timeout mechanism entirely.

DONE.
