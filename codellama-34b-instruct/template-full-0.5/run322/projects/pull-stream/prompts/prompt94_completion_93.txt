  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `null`, which is a valid value, but `undefined` is not a valid value and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `null`, which is a falsy value, but `true` is a truthy value and would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `null`, which is a valid value, but `'hello'` is a string value and would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
