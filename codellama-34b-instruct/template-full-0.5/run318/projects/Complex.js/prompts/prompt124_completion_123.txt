  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real parts of the two complex numbers instead of subtracting them, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of subtracting them, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real parts of the two complex numbers instead of subtracting them, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
