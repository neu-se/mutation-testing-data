  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort()` method sorts the array in place and returns undefined, whereas the `reverse()` method reverses the array and returns the reversed array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(props.pop())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array, whereas the `pop()` method removes the last element of an array and returns it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of an array and returns it, whereas the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array.

DONE.
