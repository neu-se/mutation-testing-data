  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `fcall` method to create a new deferred object, while this replacement would call the `fcall` method and discard the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `fcall` method without any arguments, while this replacement would call the `fcall` method with a `null` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `fcall` method without any arguments, while this replacement would call the `fcall` method with an `undefined` argument.

DONE.
