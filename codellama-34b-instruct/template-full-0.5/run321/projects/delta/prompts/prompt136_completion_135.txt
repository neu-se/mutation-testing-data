  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which means that the `peek` method is called with a variable placeholder, not a fixed value. Replacing the placeholder with `0` would cause the `peek` method to always return the first element in the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which means that the `peek` method is called with a variable placeholder, not a fixed value. Replacing the placeholder with `index` would cause the `peek` method to return the element at the current index in the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
