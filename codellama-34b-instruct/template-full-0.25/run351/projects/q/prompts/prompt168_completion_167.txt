  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.indexOf(" ") > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable is not defined.

DONE.
