  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function, and `nextStream()` would call that function, whereas `nextStream` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes two arguments, and `nextStream(null, function(err, data) {})` would call that function with two arguments, whereas `nextStream` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream.call(null, function(err, data) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream.call` is a function that calls the `nextStream` function with a specific `this` value, whereas `nextStream` by itself would simply refer to the function without calling it.
