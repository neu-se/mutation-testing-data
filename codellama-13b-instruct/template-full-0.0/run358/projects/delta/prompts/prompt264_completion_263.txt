  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes || otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return the first truthy value, which in this case is `thisOp.attributes` if it is truthy, and `otherOp.attributes` if `thisOp.attributes` is falsy. This could result in different behavior if the attributes of `thisOp` and `otherOp` are not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes && otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will return the first falsy value, which in this case is `thisOp.attributes` if it is falsy, and `otherOp.attributes` if `thisOp.attributes` is truthy. This could result in different behavior if the attributes of `thisOp` and `otherOp` are not the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes + other
