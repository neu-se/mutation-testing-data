 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the exponentiation would always be 1, regardless of the value of the instance's 're' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the exponentiation would always be the instance's 'im' property, instead of the 're' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the exponentiation would always be the mathematical constant e, instead of the instance's 're' property.

DONE.
