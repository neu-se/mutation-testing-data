  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toFixed(2)` method would be called on the `result.value`, which would convert the value to a string with two decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.toExponential(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toExponential(2)` method would be called on the `result.value`, which would convert the value to a string in exponential notation with two decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.toPrecision(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toPrecision(2)` method would be called on the `result.value`, which would convert the value to a string with two significant digits.

DONE.
