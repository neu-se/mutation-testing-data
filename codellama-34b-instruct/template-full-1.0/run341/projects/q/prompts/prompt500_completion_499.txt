  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when used with promises. `call` binds the `this` context of the function and passes in the arguments individually, whereas `apply` binds the `this` context of the function and passes in an array of arguments. In the context of the original code, `value.apply(null, args)` is used to apply the `value` function with the `this` context set to `null` and the arguments set to `args`, which is an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` context set to the first argument and the remaining arguments are passed in as the arguments of the new function. In the context of the original code, `value.apply(null, args)` is used to apply the `value`
