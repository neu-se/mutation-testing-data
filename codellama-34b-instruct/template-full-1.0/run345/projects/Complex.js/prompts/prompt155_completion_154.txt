  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']() || !z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both zeros, while this code checks for one or the other.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the case where both are non-zero, while this code checks for the case where both are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the case where both are finite, while this code checks for the case where both are infinite.

DONE.
