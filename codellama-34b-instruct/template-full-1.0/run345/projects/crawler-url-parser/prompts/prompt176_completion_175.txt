  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res = parse(url, parsed = {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsed` parameter is an empty object in the original code, but in the modified code, it is set to `url`, which is a string. This would change the behavior of the `parse()` function and result in different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res = parse(url, parsed = undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsed` parameter is an empty object in the original code, but in the modified code, it is set to `undefined`, which would cause the `parse()` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res = parse(url, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsed` parameter is an empty object in the original code, but in the modified code, it is set to `null`, which would cause the `parse()` function to behave differently.
