  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match a forward slash followed by any number of non-forward slash characters, and then matches an optional forward slash. The replacement code fragment uses a regular expression to match a forward slash followed by any number of non-forward slash characters, and then matches a space character. This would cause the code to behave differently when encountering a space character in the URL.

DONE.
