  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.log(...ctx.arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.log` would be called with
the values from `ctx.arguments`, which are the original function arguments,
unlike the original code where `ctx` was passed unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement
would output a random number, whereas the original code would output the
contents of the `ctx` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return policy.query(path, verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` object would be
omitted from the call to `policy.query`, whereas the original code included
`ctx` in the call.

DONE.
