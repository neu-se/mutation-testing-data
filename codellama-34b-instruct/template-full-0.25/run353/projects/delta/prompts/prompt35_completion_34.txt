  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b == null` would check if `b` is null or undefined, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` only checks if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` would check if `b` is falsy, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` only checks if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would check if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` only checks if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
