  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always be true, regardless of the value of `keepNull`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull || isNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would be true if `keepNull` is false or if the value of `attributes[key]` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull && !isNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would be true if `keepNull` is true and the value of `attributes[key]` is not null.

DONE.
