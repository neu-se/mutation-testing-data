  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` creates a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, while `Array.prototype.pop` removes and returns the last element of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` creates a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, while `Array.prototype.shift` removes and returns the first element of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` creates a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, while `Array.prototype.filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function.

DONE.
