  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `data`, which would cause the `if` statement to execute the true branch when `data` is `false`, and the false branch when `data` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would increment the value of `data` by `1`, which would change the value of `data` and potentially cause the `if` statement to execute the true branch when `data` is less than or equal to `0`, or the false branch when `data` is greater than `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would double the value of `data`, which would change the value of `data` and potentially cause the `if` statement to execute the true branch when `data` is
