  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so `when` would never be called, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so `when` would never be called, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` returns a rejected promise, so `when` would be called with a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
