  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the key as an argument to the `delete` method, while the new code fragment passes both the key and value as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the key as an argument to the `delete` method, while the new code fragment passes a string representation of the key and value as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the key as an argument to the `delete` method, while the new code fragment passes the key and `undefined` as arguments.

DONE.
