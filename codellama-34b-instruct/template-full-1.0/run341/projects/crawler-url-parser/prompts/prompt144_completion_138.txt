  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of strings at the end of the URL, which could impact the logic of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the string case-insensitively, which could impact the logic of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[a-z\.]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the string to contain periods after the "index", which could impact the logic of the code.

DONE.
