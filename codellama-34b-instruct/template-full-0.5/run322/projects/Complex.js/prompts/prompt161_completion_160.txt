  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()`, which means that if both `this` and `z` are infinite, the result will be `Complex['INFINITY']`. However, the new code only checks for `this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()`, which means that if only one of `this` or `z` is infinite, the result will be `Complex['NAN']`.
