  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` and `universalify.fromPromise` have different signatures and are used in different contexts. `universalify.fromCallback` is used to wrap a callback-based function into a promise-based function, while `universalify.fromPromise` is used to wrap a promise-based function into a callback-based function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` expects a function that returns a promise, while `function* () {}` is a generator function that returns an iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise(async function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` expects a function that returns a
