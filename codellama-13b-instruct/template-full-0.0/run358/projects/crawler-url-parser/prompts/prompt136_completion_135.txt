  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it case-insensitive, which would cause it to match URLs with different cases, such as `https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager` and `https://www.npmjs.com/package/Electron-Window-Manager`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression makes it global, which would cause it to match all occurrences of the pattern in the URL, rather than just the first one. This could cause the code to behave differently if there are multiple occurrences of the pattern in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
