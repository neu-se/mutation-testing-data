  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would always result in 0, causing the loop to only iterate once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would always result in 1, causing the loop to iterate twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would always result in `end`, causing the loop to iterate `end` times.

DONE.
