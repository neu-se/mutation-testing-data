  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fail()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail()` is a method that rejects a promise, causing the promise to be in the rejected state, whereas `callback()` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function, whereas `throw new Error("Test error")` would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Test error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the result of the callback function, whereas `Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))` would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error.
