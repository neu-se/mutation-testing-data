  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression would also match strings containing "default." followed by any character except for a newline, whereas the original regular expression only matches strings containing "index." followed by any character except for a newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression would match any string not containing a slash, instead of specifically matching strings containing "index." or "default." followed by any character except for a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^d][^e][^f][^a][^u][^l][^t]\.[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regular expression would match any string not containing the characters "default" in that order, regardless of what precedes them or follows them, instead of specifically matching strings containing "index
