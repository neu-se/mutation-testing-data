  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '+' operator would be added to the regular expression, which would cause the regular expression to match more than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '-' operator would be added to the regular expression, which would cause the regular expression to match less than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the '*' operator would be added to the regular expression, which would cause the regular expression to match zero or more times, rather than the expected one or more times.

DONE.
