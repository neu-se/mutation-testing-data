  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to an error.

DONE.
