  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the key, even if the value is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the key, even if the value is undefined, but it would use a hard-coded string instead of the `undefined` keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the key, even if the value is undefined, but it would use the `val` variable, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
