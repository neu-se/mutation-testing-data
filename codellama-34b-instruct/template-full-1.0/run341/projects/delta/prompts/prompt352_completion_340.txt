  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes ** baseOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `**` operator performs exponentiation, which is not the intended operation in this context.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes << baseOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<<` operator performs a bitwise left shift, which is not the intended operation in this context.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes = baseOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `op.attributes` object with the `baseOp.attributes` object, rather than merging the two objects as intended.

DONE.
