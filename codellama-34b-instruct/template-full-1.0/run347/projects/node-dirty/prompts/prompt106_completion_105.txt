  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `row.val`, which is the value stored in the database for the corresponding key. This would cause the `set` method to store the negation of the value instead of the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `row.val`, which is the value stored in the database for the corresponding key. This would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the value it was originally intending to store.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to store a different value than the value it was originally intending to store.

DONE.
