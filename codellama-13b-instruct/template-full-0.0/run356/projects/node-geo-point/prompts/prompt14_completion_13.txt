  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point.coordinates` property is an array, while the new code fragment checks if the `point.coordinates` property is an array and has a length of 2. This could cause the test to fail if the `point.coordinates` property is not an array or has a length other than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point.coordinates` property is an array and has a length of 2, while the new code fragment checks if the `point.coordinates` property has a length of 2. This could cause the test to pass if the `point.coordinates` property is not an array, or has a length other than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
