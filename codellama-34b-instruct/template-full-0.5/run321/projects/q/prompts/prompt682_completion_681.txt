  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is being called on the `Q` object instead of the `object` parameter, which could cause the method to be called on the wrong object and potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is being called on the `object` parameter directly, which could cause the method to be called on the wrong object and potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is being called on the `object` parameter with a different set of arguments
