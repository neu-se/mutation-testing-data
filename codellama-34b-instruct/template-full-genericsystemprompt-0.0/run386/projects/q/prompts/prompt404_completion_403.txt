  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would be called with `null` as the rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would be called with `undefined` as the rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method would be called with the string `"error"` as the rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of the intended rejection reason.

DONE.
