  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the stack trace in the error message, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the string representation of the error object in the error message, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the error message in the error message, which may not be desirable in all cases.

DONE.
