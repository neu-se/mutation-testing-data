  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` returns the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is not a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` returns the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is not a valid method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new array with the specified elements, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is not a valid method.

DONE.
