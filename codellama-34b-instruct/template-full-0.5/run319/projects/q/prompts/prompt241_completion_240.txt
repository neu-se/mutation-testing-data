  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may return a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` is the negation of `isPromise`, and it may return a different result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(value) || isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is a promise-like or a promise, and it may return a different result for the same input.

DONE.
