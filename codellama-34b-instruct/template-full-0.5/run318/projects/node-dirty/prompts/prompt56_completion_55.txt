  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called immediately, rather than when the "drain" event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different `this` context, potentially leading to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to errors.

DONE.
