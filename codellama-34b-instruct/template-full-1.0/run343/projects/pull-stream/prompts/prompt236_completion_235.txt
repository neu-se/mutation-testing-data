  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && <PLACEHOLDER>` would return `false` if `end` is `true`, whereas `end` alone would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || <PLACEHOLDER>` would return `true` if `end` is `false`, whereas `end` alone would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end && <PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end && <PLACEHOLDER>` would return `true` if `end` is `false`, whereas `end` alone would return `false`.

DONE.
