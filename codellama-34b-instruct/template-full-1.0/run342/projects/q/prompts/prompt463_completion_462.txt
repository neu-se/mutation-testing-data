  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of reported unhandled rejections, rather than checking if a given promise has been reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of unhandled rejections, rather than checking if a given promise has been reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the array of reported unhandled rejections, rather than checking if a given promise has been reported.

DONE.
