  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the value of `min`, whereas the original code fragment would return the floor of `min` divided by 60.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the ceiling of `min` divided by 60, whereas the original code fragment would return the floor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(min / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the rounded value of `min` divided by 60, whereas the original code fragment would return the floor.

DONE.
