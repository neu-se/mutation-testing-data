  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer be subtracting 2 from the length of the word, but rather just subtracting 1. This could potentially cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer be subtracting 2 from the length of the word, but rather just subtracting 3. This could potentially cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer be subtracting 2 from the length of the word, but rather just subtracting 4. This could potentially cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
