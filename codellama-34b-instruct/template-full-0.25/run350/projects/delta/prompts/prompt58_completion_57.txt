  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `ops` property is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray` method would be called with the `ops` property as its argument, which would always return `true` if `ops` is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator would check if `ops` is an instance of the `Array` class, which would always return `true` if `ops` is an array.

DONE.
