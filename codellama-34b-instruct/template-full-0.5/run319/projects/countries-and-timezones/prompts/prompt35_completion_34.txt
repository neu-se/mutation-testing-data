  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra hour to the offset, which could cause errors in the calculation of the UTC offset and DST offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract an extra hour from the offset, which could cause errors in the calculation of the UTC offset and DST offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the offset, which could cause errors in the calculation of the UTC offset and DST offset.

DONE.
