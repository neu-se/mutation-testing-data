  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `insert` property of both `newOp` and `lastOp` are strings, while this code checks if they are objects. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string or object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `insert` property of both `newOp` and `lastOp` are strings, while this code checks if they are numbers. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string or number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'boolean' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'boolean'
