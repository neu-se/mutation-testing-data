Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the predicate function, causing the filter to return elements that do not satisfy the original condition, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that only includes elements at even indices, which may exclude valid elements that satisfy the original predicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the index passed to the predicate function, effectively shifting the evaluation by one position, which could lead to incorrect filtering of the operations.

DONE.
