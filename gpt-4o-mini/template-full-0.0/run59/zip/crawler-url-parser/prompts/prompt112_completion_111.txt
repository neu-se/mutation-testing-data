Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `currentUrl` to `null` would prevent any subsequent operations on it, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior when trying to access properties or methods on `currentUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `currentUrl` to a fixed URL would bypass the parsing logic for the actual `href` values from the anchor tags, leading to incorrect or incomplete URL extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing `currentUrl` to `undefined` would cause the subsequent checks and operations that rely on its value to behave differently, potentially leading to skipped logic or incorrect handling of URLs.

DONE.
