  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the negation of the original expression, which would result in the inverse of the expected behavior when this expression is used in the context of the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the disjunction of the two expressions, which would result in a different outcome than the original expression when this expression is used in the context of the `Complex` class.
