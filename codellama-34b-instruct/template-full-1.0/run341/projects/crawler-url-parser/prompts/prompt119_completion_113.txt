  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl` and `baseUrl` are different objects, and the `gettype` function relies on the properties of the `baseUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl` is the result of the `URL.parse` function, and the `gettype` function relies on the properties of the `parsedBaseUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStudio
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStudio` is a different variable and does not have the same properties as `baseUrl`.

DONE.
