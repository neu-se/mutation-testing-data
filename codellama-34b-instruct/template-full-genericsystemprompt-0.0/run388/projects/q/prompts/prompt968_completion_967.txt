  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked with `apply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when invoked with `apply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) when invoked with `apply`, which would cause a `TypeError` if the function expects a different `this` value.

DONE.
