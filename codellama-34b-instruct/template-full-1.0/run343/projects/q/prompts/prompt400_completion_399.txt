  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("placeholder"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is now rejected rather than resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise resolves to a different value (undefined).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("placeholder")))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise resolves to a rejected promise rather than a resolved promise.

DONE.
