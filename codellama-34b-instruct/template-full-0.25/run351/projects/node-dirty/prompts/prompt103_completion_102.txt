  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the row, while `row.key` is the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the key, which could cause the code to access the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the key by 2, which could cause the code to access the wrong data.

DONE.
