  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different, and it would produce a different plural form for the matched words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement function is different, and it would produce a different plural form for the matched words.

DONE.
