  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from less than or equal to (<=) to greater than or equal to (>=). This would cause the loop to continue executing even if the length of the insert operation is less than or equal to the value of firstLeft.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from greater than or equal to (>=) to less than or equal to (<=). This would cause the loop to continue executing even if the length of the insert operation is greater than the value of firstLeft.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
