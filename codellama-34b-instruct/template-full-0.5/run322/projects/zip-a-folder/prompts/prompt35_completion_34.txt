  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output, { end: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option is set to `false`, which means that the output stream will not be closed when the archive is finalized. This could cause issues if the output stream is expected to be closed after the archive is written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

zipArchive.pipe(output, { end: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option is set to `true`, which means that the output stream will be closed when the archive is finalized. This could cause issues if the output stream is not expected to be closed after the archive is written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output, { end: false, finish: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` option is set to `true`, which means that the output stream will be closed when the archive
