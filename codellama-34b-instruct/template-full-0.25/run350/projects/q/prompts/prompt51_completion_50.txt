  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestTick` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `requestTick` function to the `null` context, rather than the `nextTick` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `requestTick` function to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than immediately.

DONE.
