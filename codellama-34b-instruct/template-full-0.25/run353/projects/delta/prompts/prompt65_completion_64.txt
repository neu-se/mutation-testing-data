  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = arg;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.retain` is a number, but `arg` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.insert` is a string, but `length` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` is an object, but `attributes` is a number.

DONE.
