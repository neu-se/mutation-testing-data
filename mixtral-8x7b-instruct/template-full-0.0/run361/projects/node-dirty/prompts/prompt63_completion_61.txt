 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream('wrong_path')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a write stream with an incorrect file path, which may not persist the data as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._readStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the read stream to the write stream variable, which may cause issues when writing data to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns null to the writeStream variable, which would prevent any further writes to the file and may cause errors in the application.

DONE.
