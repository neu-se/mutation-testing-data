  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter would be passed as the first argument to `untrackRejection`, instead of the `rejection` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter would be passed as the second argument to `untrackRejection`, instead of the `rejection` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter would be passed as the third argument to `untrackRejection`, instead of the `rejection` parameter.

DONE.
