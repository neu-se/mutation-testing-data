  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `spec` string matches the regular expression, rather than `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null && spec.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used to check if the `spec` string is not empty and the regular expression match fails, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if the `spec` string is not empty and does not match the regular expression, rather than `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
