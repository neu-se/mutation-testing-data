  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, and therefore cannot be invoked with the `apply()` method. In the original code, the `apply()` method is used to call the `pull()` function with a variable number of arguments, but if `undefined` is used as the context, it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and does not have a `source` property or a `pull` method. In the original code, the `read` variable is assumed to be a function that has a `source` property and a `pull` method, but if it is replaced with an empty object, it will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is not a function and does not have a `source`
