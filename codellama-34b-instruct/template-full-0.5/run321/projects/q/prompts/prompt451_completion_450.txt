  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.stack` is undefined, and pushing undefined to an array would not have the same effect as pushing a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push("(no stack) " + reason.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.message` is a string, and concatenating it with "(no stack)" would not have the same effect as concatenating it with `reason.stack`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.toString());
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.toString()` is a string, and pushing it to an array would not have the same effect as pushing a string that starts with "(no stack) ".

DONE.
