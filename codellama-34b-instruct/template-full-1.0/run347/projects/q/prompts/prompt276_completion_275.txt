  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(<error>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the program to produce different output or have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(<error>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be resolved with the error value instead of the fulfilled value, which could cause the program to produce different output or have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notify(<error>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be notified with the error value instead of the fulfilled value, which could cause the program to produce different output or have different behavior.

DONE.
