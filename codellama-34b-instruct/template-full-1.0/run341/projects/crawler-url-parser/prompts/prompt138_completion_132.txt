  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...replace(<PLACEHOLDER>, /./g);
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/./g` matches any character, including slashes, while the original expression `index\.[a-z]+$` only matches the string literal "index.".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...replace(<PLACEHOLDER>, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, while the original expression `index\.[a-z]+$` matches and replaces the suffix of a word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...replace(<PLACEHOLDER>, /[^\/]*$/);
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^\/]*$/` matches any character excluding slashes at the end of the string, while the original expression `index\.[a-z]+$` only matches the string literal "index.".
