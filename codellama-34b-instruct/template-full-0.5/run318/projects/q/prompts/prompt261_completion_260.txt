  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!resolvedPromise` would always return the opposite boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, which could cause the `become` function to be called with a different value, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise + 1` would always return a different value than `resolvedPromise`, which could cause the `become` function to be called with a different value, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promise` would always return a different value than `resolvedPromise`, which could cause the `become` function to be called with a different value, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
