  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called every time a promise is rejected, regardless of whether it has been handled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called every time a promise is fulfilled, regardless of whether it has been handled or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called only if the `process` variable is not defined, which would prevent the `unhandledRejection` event from being emitted.

DONE.
