  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackRejection` function would be called on a rejected promise, which would track the rejection and potentially cause an unhandled rejection error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called on a rejected promise, which would untrack the rejection and potentially prevent an unhandled rejection error from being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` function would be called on a rejected promise, which would stop tracking unhandled rejections and potentially prevent an unhandled rejection error from being thrown.

DONE.
