  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('body').attr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `body` element is not the same as the `base` element, and the `attr` method may return different values depending on the element and its attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` element is not the same as the `base` element, and the `attr` method may return different values depending on the element and its attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method is called with a different argument, which can affect the value that is returned.

DONE.
