  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not a number and would always return `false`, whereas the original code would correctly check if `delete` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a keyword and using it as a variable name would throw a syntax error, whereas the original code would correctly check if `delete` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `delete` is a property of `nextOp`, whereas the original code would correctly check if `delete` is a number.

DONE.
