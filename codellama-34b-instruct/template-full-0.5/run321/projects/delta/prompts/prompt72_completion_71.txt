  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to access the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to access the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to access the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object.

DONE.
