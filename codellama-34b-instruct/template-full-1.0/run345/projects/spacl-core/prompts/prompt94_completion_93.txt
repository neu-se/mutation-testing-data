  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.get('name')
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.get('name')` will return the value associated with the key `'name'` in the `Policy` object, which may not be the same as the `name` property of the `Policy` object.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy['name']
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy['name']` will return the value associated with the key `'name'` in the `Policy` object, which may not be the same as the `name` property of the `Policy` object.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.set('name', 'policy2')
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.set('name', 'policy2')` will set the value associated with the key `'name'` in the `Policy` object to `'policy2'`, which may not be the same as the value of the `name` property of the
