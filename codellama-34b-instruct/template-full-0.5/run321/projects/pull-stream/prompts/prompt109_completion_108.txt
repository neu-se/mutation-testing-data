  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `reducer` function, which would cause the `acc` variable to be incremented by the value of `data` instead of applying the `reducer` function to the `acc` and `data` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used instead of the `reducer` function, which would cause the `acc` variable to be decremented by the value of `data` instead of applying the `reducer` function to the `acc` and `data` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `reducer` function, which would cause the `acc` variable to be multiplied by the value of `data` instead of applying the `reducer`
