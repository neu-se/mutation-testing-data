  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` refers to the second element of the `rule` array, whereas `rule[2]` refers to the third element. If the `rule` array has only two elements, then `rule[2]` would be `undefined`, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` refers to the first element of the `rule` array, whereas `rule[0]` refers to the second element. If the `rule` array has only two elements, then `rule[0]` would be the same as `rule[1]`, which may cause duplicate or inconsistent behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` refers to the second element of the `rule` array, whereas `rule
