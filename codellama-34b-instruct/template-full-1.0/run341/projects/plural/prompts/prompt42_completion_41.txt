  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes two arguments, the first being the start index, and the second being the length of the substring to be extracted. With the placeholder replaced with `1`, the `substr` method would be extracting a substring from the second character (`w.length - 1`) to the end of the string (`w.length`), which would result in the same string being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes two arguments, the first being the start index, and the second being the length of the substring to be extracted. With the placeholder replaced with `-1`, the `substr` method would be extracting a substring from the last character (`w.length - 1`) to the start of the string (`0`), which would be an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different
