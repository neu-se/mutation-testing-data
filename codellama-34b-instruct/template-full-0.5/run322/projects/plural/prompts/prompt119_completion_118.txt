  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, causing the regular expression to match only at the end of the string, and not at the beginning or in the middle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match multiple times in the string, and not just at the first match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, causing the regular expression to match at the beginning or in the middle of the string, and not just at the end.

DONE.
