  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method that checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if the number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['hasImaginary']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasImaginary` is a different method that checks if the complex number has an imaginary part, while `isZero` checks if the real part is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']() > 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` returns the absolute value of the complex number, and `> 10` checks if the absolute value is greater than 10, while `isZero` checks if the real part is zero.

DONE.
