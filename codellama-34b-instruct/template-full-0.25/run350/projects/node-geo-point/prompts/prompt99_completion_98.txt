  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the coordinates are added together, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the coordinates are multiplied together, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
