  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch("when", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method will be called with the arguments `"when"` and an empty array, which will cause the `when` method to be applied to `resolvedPromise`, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method will be called with an `Error` object, which will cause the promise to be rejected with that error, whereas the original code fragment would have resolved the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.notify(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method will be called with a no-op function as the progress listener, which will cause the promise to be notified but not resolved or rejected.

DONE.
