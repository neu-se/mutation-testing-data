  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could affect the logic of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could affect the logic of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return a different value, which could affect the logic of the program.

DONE.
