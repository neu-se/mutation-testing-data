  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) would perform a different operation than the bitwise OR operator (`|`) used in the original code fragment. The AND operator would only return a truthy value if both `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK` are true, whereas the OR operator would return a truthy value if either `fs.constants.R_OK` or `fs.constants.W_OK` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) would perform a different operation than the bitwise OR operator (`|`) used in the original code fragment. The XOR operator would only return a truthy value if one and only one of `fs.constants.R_OK
