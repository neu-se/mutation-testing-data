  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This code fragment is different from the original in that it passes `null` as the argument to `finalize()`, whereas the original code passes a function. This could potentially cause the `finalize()` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(undefined);
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but it passes `undefined` instead of `null`. This could also potentially cause the `finalize()` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(1);
```
This code fragment passes a number (`1`) as the argument to `finalize()`, which is different from the original code that passes a function. This could cause the `finalize()` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
