 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve.apply(deferred, [null].concat(nodeArgs));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` function is not being called, and the `deferred.resolve` method is directly called with the nodeArgs. This would bypass the error handling mechanism in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(nodeArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` are passed as a single argument to `deferred.resolve()`, instead of being spread as individual arguments. This would cause issues if the `resolve` method expects individual arguments instead of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(nodeArgs);
