  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object, but `null` is not an object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object with specific properties, but `{}` is an empty object and would not have those properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `options` to be an object with an `encoding` property, but `options.encoding` would be `undefined` if `options` is not an object with an `encoding` property.

DONE.
