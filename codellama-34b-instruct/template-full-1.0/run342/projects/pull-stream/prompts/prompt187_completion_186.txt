  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid JavaScript value, but it is not a value that can be used as a function argument. The original code expects a function to be passed as the second argument, and it will call that function with the value `true` as an argument. If `undefined` is passed instead of a function, it will cause an error when the code tries to call `cb(undefined, array[i++])`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JavaScript value that is often used as a placeholder for "no value". However, the original code expects a function to be passed as the second argument, and it will call that function with the value `true` as an argument. If `null` is passed instead of a function, it will cause an error when the code tries to call `cb(null, array[i++])`.
