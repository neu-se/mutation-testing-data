  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/:/|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `/` in the regex pattern would cause the match to always be successful, even if the path contains invalid characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` character at the beginning of the regex pattern would cause the match to always fail, even if the path is valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]*:|:\/|:$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` character at the end of the regex pattern would cause the match to always succeed, even if the path contains invalid characters.

DONE.
