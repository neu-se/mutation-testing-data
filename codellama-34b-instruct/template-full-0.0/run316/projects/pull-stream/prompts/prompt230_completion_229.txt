  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with the `data` argument, which may cause it to return a different result than when it was called with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is now being called with two arguments, which may cause it to return a different result than when it was called with one argument.

DONE.
