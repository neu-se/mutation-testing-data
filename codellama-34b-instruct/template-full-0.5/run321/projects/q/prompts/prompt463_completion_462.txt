  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track unhandled rejections differently than the original code, which would cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.getUnhandledReasons()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the unhandled reasons in a different format than the original code, which would cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
