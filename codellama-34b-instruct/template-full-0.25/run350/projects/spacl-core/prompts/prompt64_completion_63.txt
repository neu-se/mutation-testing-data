  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging the current array with the provided array, whereas `push` modifies the current array by adding the provided element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to the array at a specific index, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
