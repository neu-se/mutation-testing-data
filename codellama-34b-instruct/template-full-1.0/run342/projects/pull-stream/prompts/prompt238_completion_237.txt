  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value to the callback function, possibly causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, read(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "read" function with the wrong arguments, possibly causing an infinite loop or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the wrong arguments, possibly causing unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
