Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a rejected promise with the value of the exception instead of resolving it, which changes the intended flow of handling the generator's return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(function() { return exception.value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves with the exception value instead of stopping the generator and returning the value directly, potentially leading to unexpected promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the promise, which does not return the value of the exception but rather an inspection object, thus altering the expected return type and behavior of the generator.

DONE.
