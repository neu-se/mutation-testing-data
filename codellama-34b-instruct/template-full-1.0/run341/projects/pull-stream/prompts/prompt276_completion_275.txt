  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would infinitely recurse and never call `nextChunk`, effectively making the `flatten` function non-functional.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `nextChunk` with a `null` value for `err`, which would cause an error to be thrown, effectively making the `flatten` function non-functional.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `nextStream` with a `null` value for `end` and `stream`, which would cause an error to be thrown, effectively making the `flatten` function non-functional.

DONE.
