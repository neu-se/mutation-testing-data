Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the indentation level to 0, resulting in a compact JSON string without any whitespace, which differs from the intended behavior of using the `spaces` parameter for pretty-printing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the third argument to `JSON.stringify` will not apply any indentation, leading to a single-line JSON string instead of a formatted one, which may not be the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` as the third argument to `JSON.stringify` will also produce a compact JSON string without any indentation, which is different from the intended use of the `spaces` parameter for formatting.

DONE.
