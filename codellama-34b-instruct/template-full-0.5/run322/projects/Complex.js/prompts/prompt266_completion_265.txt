  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which changes the result of the `atan2` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are modified, which changes the result of the `atan2` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b, a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are multiplied or divided, which changes the result of the `atan2` function.

DONE.
