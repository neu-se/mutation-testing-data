  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to the `abortCb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the `abortCb` function would throw an error when it tries to call `onAbort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `abortCb` function would throw an error when it tries to call `onAbort`.

DONE.
