 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the imaginary part of the result, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when the input's imaginary part (b) is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(1 / b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value between -π/2 and π/2 for the imaginary part of the result, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
