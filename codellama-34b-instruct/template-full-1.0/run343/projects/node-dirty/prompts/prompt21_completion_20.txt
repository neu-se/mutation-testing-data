  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(Buffer.from(key));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the key to the write stream, instead of the value associated with the key, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(Buffer.from(val));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the value associated with the key, instead of the key itself, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(Buffer.from(key + ' ' + val));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the key-value pair separated by a space character, instead of just the key, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
