  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2[1]` would return the first capture group of the regex match, which may not be the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt2[0]` would return the entire string matched by the regex, which may not be a line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[1]` would return the first capture group of the regex match, which may not be the line number.

DONE.
