  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be discarded, and the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of being rejected with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and thrown, instead of using the original error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be created and thrown, instead of using the original error object.

DONE.
