Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate when there are no more operations in `otherIter`, effectively skipping any remaining operations in `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue as long as there are operations in `thisIter`, ignoring the state of `otherIter` entirely, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next operation in `otherIter` is not null, which could lead to a situation where the loop continues based on the presence of an operation rather than whether there are more operations to process, potentially causing unexpected results.

DONE.
