  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a different array than `arguments`, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would return a different array than `arguments`, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 4)` would return a different array than `arguments`, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
