  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `insert` operation to be performed even if the `lastOp` is not an object, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `insert` operation to be performed even if the `lastOp` is not an object and the `insert` property is not defined, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert != null && lastOp.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `insert` operation to be performed only if the `lastOp` is an object and the `insert` property is defined, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
