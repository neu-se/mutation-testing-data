  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the property 'key' exists in the object `row`, while `!row.hasOwnProperty('key')` checks if the property 'key' exists in the object `row` and is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the property 'key' exists in the object `row`, while `row.key === undefined` checks if the property 'key' exists and is undefined in the object `row`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof row.key === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the property 'key' exists in the object `row`, while `typeof row.key === 'undefined'` checks if the
