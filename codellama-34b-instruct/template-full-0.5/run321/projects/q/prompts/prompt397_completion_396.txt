  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value. Using `thenReject` instead of `thenResolve` would cause the promise to be rejected, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called when the promise is resolved. If the callback function throws an exception, the promise is rejected. Using `throw reason` inside the callback function would cause the promise to be rejected, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function () { return Q.reject(reason); })
```
This would result in different
