  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain period of time, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed at the end of the current event loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that schedules a function to be executed at the end of the current event loop, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed at the end of the current event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is a function that schedules a function to be executed at the end of the current animation frame, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed at the
