  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that have been rejected, rather than all promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that are still pending, rather than all promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that have been fulfilled, rather than all promises.

DONE.
