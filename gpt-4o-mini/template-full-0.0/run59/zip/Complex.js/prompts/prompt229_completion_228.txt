Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the scaling factor from 2.0 to 3.0, which would affect the calculation of the real part of the square root, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of `a` in the calculation, which would lead to a different value being used in the square root calculation, potentially resulting in an incorrect complex square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the term involving `a` with `b`, which is unrelated to the magnitude of the complex number, leading to an incorrect calculation of the real part of the square root.

DONE.
