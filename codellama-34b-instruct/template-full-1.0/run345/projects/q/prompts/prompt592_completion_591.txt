  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` refers to the function's argument object, while in this replacement, `placeholder` is just a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is an array-like object, while in this replacement, `placeholder` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const placeholder = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is an array-like object, while in this replacement, `placeholder` is an empty array.

DONE.
