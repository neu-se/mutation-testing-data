Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1], read
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially altering the expected output based on the new argument arrangement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the second argument with `null`, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when the `pull` function processes the arguments, especially if it expects a valid function or object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it duplicates the first argument (`ref[0]`), which could lead to unintended consequences in the logic of the `pull` function, especially if the function relies on unique values for its operations.

DONE.
