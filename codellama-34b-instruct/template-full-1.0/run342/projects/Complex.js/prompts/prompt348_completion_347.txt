  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable from `b`, and may have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `b` would change the value of the expression, which would affect the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable from `b`, and may have different values.

DONE.
