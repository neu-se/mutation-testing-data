  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spex.split('/').slice(1).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because the split() method returns an array of strings, but the split() method is not called on the spec variable, which is a string. Therefore, this replacement would result in a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(&кс sites launched and closed in 2022 factorized/).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because the part 'х sites launched and closed in 2022 factorized' is not a valid regex pattern, and therefore the split() method would not be able to match it. Therefore, this replacement would result in an invalid regex pattern error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
speex.split('/').slice(1).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable speex is undefined, and therefore the split() method would not be able to be called on it. Therefore, this replacement
