  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is not bound and will be called with the global object as its context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(null)` calls the `dispatch` method with the global object as its context, whereas `this.dispatch` is called with the current object as its context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)` calls the `dispatch` method with the current object as its context and passes the `arguments` object as its argument, whereas `this.dispatch` is called with the current object as its context and passes the `arguments
