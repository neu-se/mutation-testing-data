  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.throw` is not a valid method and would cause the code to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would prevent the error from being detected and the test would pass when it should have failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.error` is not a valid method and would cause the code to crash.

DONE.
