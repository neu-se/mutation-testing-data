  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.slice()` creates a new array that is a shallow copy of `this.rules`, whereas `this.rules` is the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.filter(() => true)` creates a new array that contains only the elements of `this.rules` that pass the filter function, whereas `this.rules` contains all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.slice().reverse()` creates a new array that is a shallow copy of `this.rules` and then reverses the order of the elements, whereas `this.rules` is the original array.

DONE.
