  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value in the database, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the database. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the `update` method to overwrite the existing value in the database with a new value, rather than updating the existing value.
