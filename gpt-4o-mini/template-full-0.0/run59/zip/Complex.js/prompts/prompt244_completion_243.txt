Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the sine of the imaginary part instead of the cosine, leading to incorrect results for the real part of the complex exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the tangent of the imaginary part instead of the cosine, which would produce a completely different value for the real part of the complex exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the imaginary part entirely, effectively treating it as zero, which would lead to incorrect results for the real part of the complex exponent.

DONE.
