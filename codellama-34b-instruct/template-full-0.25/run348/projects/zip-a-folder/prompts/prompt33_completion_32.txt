  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the program to continue executing without any indication of an error.

DONE.
