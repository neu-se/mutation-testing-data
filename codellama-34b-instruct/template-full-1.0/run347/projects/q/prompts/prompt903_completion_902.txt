  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because when `deferred.reject` is called, the promise is rejected and any `then` methods waiting for the promise's resolution will not be called. However, if `deferred.resolve` is called, the promise is resolved and any `then` methods waiting for the promise's resolution will be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because when `deferred.reject` is called, the promise is rejected and any `catch` methods waiting for the promise's rejection will not be called. However, if `deferred.notify` is called, the promise will notify any listeners of progress but not resolve or reject the promise, which can cause the test to fail if it is expecting the promise to be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fuusing
```
This would result in different behavior because
