  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the parent context to the `matches` method instead of the original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the name of the context instead of the original context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the path of the context instead of the original context.

DONE.
