  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is the opposite of `ses.ok`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.maybeOk` is a new property that does not exist in the `ses` object, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok && ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if either `ses.ok` or `ses.notOk` is `false`, regardless of the value of the other expression.

DONE.
