  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array` variable to be treated as an array, even if it is not an array. This would cause the `Object.keys` method to return an empty array, and the `map` method to be called on an empty array, resulting in an empty output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array` variable to be treated as an empty array, even if it is not an empty array. This would cause the `Object.keys` method to return an empty array, and the `map` method to be called on an empty array, resulting in an empty output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `array` variable to be treated as a non-empty array, even if it is
