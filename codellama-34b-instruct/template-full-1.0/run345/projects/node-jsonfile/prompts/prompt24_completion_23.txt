  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function(){}` is a function expression that returns `undefined`, whereas `JSON.parse` is a method that parses the input JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x => x` is an arrow function that returns the input arguments as is, whereas `JSON.parse` is a method that parses the input JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (true) { JSON.parse(content); };
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (true) { ... };` is a statement that always evaluates to `true`, whereas `JSON.parse` is a method that may fail if the input JSON string is not well-formed.

DONE.
