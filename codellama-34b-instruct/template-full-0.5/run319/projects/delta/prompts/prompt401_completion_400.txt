  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `embedType` of the object `thisData`, which may not exist or have a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `embedType` of the object `otherData`, which may not exist or have a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property `embedType` of the object `thisData`, which may not exist or have a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
