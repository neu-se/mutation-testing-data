  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `test` function return `true` for non-matching data, which is the opposite of what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `data` variable, which would cause the code to produce different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `test` function return `true` for non-matching data plus 1, which is different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
