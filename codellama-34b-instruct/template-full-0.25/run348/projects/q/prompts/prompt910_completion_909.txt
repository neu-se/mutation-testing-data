  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and pass the second argument as the first argument to `array_slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments to `array_slice`, including the `callback` function, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to `array_slice`, which would cause an error.

DONE.
