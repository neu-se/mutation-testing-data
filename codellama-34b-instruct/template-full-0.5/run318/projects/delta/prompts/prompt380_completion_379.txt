  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next two elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next `length` elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to skip over the next `length + 1` elements in the array.

DONE.
