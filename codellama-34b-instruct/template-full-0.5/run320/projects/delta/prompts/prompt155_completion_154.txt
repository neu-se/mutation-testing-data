  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even when there are no more ops in the other iter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even when there are no more ops in the this iter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even when the next op in the other iter is a delete op.

DONE.
