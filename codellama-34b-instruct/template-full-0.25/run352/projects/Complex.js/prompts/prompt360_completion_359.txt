  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `b`, which would cause the `cosh` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * 2` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `b`, which would cause the `cosh` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b - 1` expression would be evaluated to a different value than `b`, which would cause the `cosh` function to return a different result.

DONE.
