  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` keyword is used to throw an exception, but it is not a valid value for the `verb` parameter in the `continuer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` keyword is used to continue the generator function, but it is not a valid value for the `verb` parameter in the `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function, but it is not a valid value for the `verb` parameter in the `continuer` function.

DONE.
