  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this._data.clear()`

This would result in different behavior because `this._data.clear()` would clear the entire Map, whereas `this._data.set()` would update or insert a new value in the Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this._queue.set(key, val)`

This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.set(key, val)` would update or insert a new value in the queue Map, whereas `this._data.set()` would update or insert a new value in the primary data Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this._data.set(key, val)`

This would result in different behavior because `this._data.set(key, val)` would update or insert a new value in the primary data Map, whereas `this._queue.set(key, val)` would update or insert a new value in the queue Map.

DONE.
