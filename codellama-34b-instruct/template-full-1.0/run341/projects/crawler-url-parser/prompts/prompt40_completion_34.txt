  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&` to check if both `parsedUrl.host` is null and `baseUrlStr` is not null, while the modified code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to check if either `parsedUrl.host` is null or `baseUrlStr` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null && baseUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&` to check if both `parsedUrl.host` is not null and `baseUrlStr` is null, while the modified code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||` to check if either `parsedUrl.host` is not null or `baseUrlStr` is null.
