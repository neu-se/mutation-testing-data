  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is used to indicate that the database is empty, while the new code fragment would indicate that the database has one entry.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is used to indicate that the database is empty, while the new code fragment would indicate that the database has one entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is used to indicate that the database is empty, while the new code fragment would indicate that the database has one entry.

DONE.
