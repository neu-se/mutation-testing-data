  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `Q.onerror` function if it exists, while the replaced code fragment would always return `false` and never call the `Q.onerror` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { throw new Error("Q.onerror was called"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `Q.onerror` function if it exists, while the replaced code fragment would always throw an error and never call the `Q.onerror` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { console.log("Q.onerror was called"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `Q.onerror` function if it exists, while the replaced code fragment would always log a message
