  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the error to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw error` would throw the error object, rather than rejecting the promise with it, which could cause the error to be uncaught and potentially crash the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify(error)` would notify the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it, which could cause the error to be ignored or handled differently.

DONE.
