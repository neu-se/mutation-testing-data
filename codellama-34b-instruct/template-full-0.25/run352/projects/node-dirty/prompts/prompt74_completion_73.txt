  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Failed to load database'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the number of rows in the database, while the modified code emits an `'error'` event with a generic error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the number of rows in the database, while the modified code emits a `'load'` event with a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the number of rows in the database, while the modified code emits a `'load'` event with the number of rows in the database plus one.

DONE.
