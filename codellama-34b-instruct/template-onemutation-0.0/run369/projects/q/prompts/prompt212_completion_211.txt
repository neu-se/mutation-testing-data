  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks the prototype chain, while `constructor` checks for the exact constructor function. In this case, `Promise` is a constructor function, and `value.constructor` would return the constructor function that created the `value` object, which may not be the same as `Promise`.
