Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.html$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically matches URLs ending with "index.html" instead of any file extension, potentially allowing other "index" files with different extensions to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]{3}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex to match "default" files with exactly three-letter extensions, which may not cover all possible default file extensions, unlike the original regex that matches any extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]{2,4}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for index files with extensions ranging from two to four characters, which could include unexpected file types and bypass the original intent of the regex.

DONE.
