  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an instance of `Error`, and therefore would not be caught by the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of `Error`, and therefore would not be caught by the `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, which would be caught by the `onUnhandledError` function.

DONE.
