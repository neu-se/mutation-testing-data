  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value for a key in the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value for a key in the data object. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set a new value for the key instead of retrieving the existing value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
