  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("Dummy error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a dummy error, which would trigger the `onRejected` function in the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("Dummy error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a dummy error, which would trigger the `onRejected` function in the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("Dummy value");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a dummy value, which would trigger the `onFulfilled` function in the `when` function.
