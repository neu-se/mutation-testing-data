  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when attempting to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is defined for the `Complex` class, but it expects a `Complex` object as its argument, not a `this` reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is defined for the `Complex` class, but it expects a `Complex` object as its argument, not a variable `a` which is a number.

DONE.
