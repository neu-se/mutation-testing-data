  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData` and `otherData` are always different objects, even if they have the same properties and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.constructor === otherData.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisData.constructor` and `otherData.constructor` are different functions, even if they create objects with the same properties and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(thisData) === JSON.stringify(otherData)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` converts objects to strings, and the resulting strings may be different even if the objects have the same properties and values.

DONE.
