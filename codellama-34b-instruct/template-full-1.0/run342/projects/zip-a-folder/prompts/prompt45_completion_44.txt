  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, but `1 + src` would convert the string to a number, potentially resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'xyz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, but `src + 'xyz'` would concatenate the string with a different suffix, potentially resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello ' + src
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, but `'hello ' + src` would prepend the string with a different prefix, potentially resulting in a different value.

DONE.
