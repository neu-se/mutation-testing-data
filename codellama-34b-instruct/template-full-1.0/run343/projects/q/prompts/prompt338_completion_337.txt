  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exception thrown by the promise instead of the inspected state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of the inspected state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is pending or not instead of the inspected state.

DONE.
