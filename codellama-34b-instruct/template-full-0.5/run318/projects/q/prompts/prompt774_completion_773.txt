  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects the input array to be in the same order as the original promises, but `reverse` would change the order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects the input array to include all the original promises, but `slice` would remove the first promise from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects the input array to only contain promises that are resolved or rejected, but `concat` would add an extra rejected promise to the array.

DONE.
