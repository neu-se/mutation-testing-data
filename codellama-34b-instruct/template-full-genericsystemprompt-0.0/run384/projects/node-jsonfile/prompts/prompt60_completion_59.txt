  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the content is not an empty string, regardless of whether it is a buffer or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString() !== '[object Buffer]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the content is not a buffer, regardless of whether it is an empty string or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.constructor.name !== 'Buffer'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the content is not a buffer, regardless of whether it is an empty string or not.

DONE.
