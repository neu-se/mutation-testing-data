  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this._flush` as a method reference, while the replaced code calls the method immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this._flush` as a method reference, while the replaced code sets the method reference to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this._flush` as a method reference, while the replaced code sets the method reference to an empty function.

DONE.
