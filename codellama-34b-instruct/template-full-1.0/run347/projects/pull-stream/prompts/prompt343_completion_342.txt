  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `abort` to be a boolean value, but this change would result in a type error if `abort` is not a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `onAbort` if `abort` is not `null`, but this change would call `onAbort` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort({})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `abort` to be a boolean value, but this change would result in `onAbort` being called with an object value.

DONE.
