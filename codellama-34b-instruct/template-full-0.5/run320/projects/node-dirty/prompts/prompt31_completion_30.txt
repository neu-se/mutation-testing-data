  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the key to `undefined`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is `undefined` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val + 1, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the value of the key by 1, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is `undefined` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val || 'default', cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the key to `'default'`, regardless of whether the `val` parameter is `undefined` or not.

DONE.
