  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input word or number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural * num
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the input word and number, rather than the plural form of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural + num
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the input word and number, rather than the plural form of the input word.

DONE.
