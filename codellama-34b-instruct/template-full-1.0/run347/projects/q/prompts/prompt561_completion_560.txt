  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.t
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would throw the `.t` property of the exception instead of the exception itself. By throwing a different value, the error handling behavior of the code would be different, potentially leading to uncaught exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const error = new Error("My error");
throw error.message;
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would throw the message of the error instead of the error itself. By throwing a string value instead of an error object, the error handling behavior of the code would be different, potentially leading to uncaught exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const error = new Error("My error");
throw error.stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would throw the stack trace of the error instead of the error itself. By throwing a string value instead of an error object, the error handling behavior of the code would be different,
