  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `.then()` method takes three arguments, the first two of which are functions that will be called if the promise is resolved or rejected, respectively. By replacing `void 0` with `null`, the second argument will be `null`, which is not a function, so it will be ignored, and only the first argument (the function to be called if the promise is resolved) will be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `.then()` method takes three arguments, the first two of which are functions that will be called if the promise is resolved or rejected, respectively. By replacing `void 0` with `0`, the second argument will be a number, which is not a function, so it will be ignored, and only the first argument (the function to be called if the promise is resolved) will be used.
