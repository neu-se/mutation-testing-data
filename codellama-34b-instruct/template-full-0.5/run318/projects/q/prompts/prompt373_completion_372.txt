  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onerror` method with the exception `e`, which would potentially change the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onerror` method without any arguments, which could potentially change the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onerror` method with `null` as the argument, which could potentially change the program's behavior.

DONE.
