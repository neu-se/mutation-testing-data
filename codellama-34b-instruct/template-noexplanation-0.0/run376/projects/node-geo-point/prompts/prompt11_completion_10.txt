  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This code fragment will return the first element of the 'coordinates' array, which is the longitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[1]
```
This code fragment will return the second element of the 'coordinates' array, which is the latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[2]
```
This code fragment will return the third element of the 'coordinates' array, which is not defined in the original code. This will cause an error and demonstrate that the test suite is not effective in catching errors in the code.

DONE.
