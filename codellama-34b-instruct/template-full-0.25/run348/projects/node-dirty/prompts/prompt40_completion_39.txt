  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fn` function with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment calls the `fn` function with two arguments, `key` and `val`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fn` function with two arguments, `key` and `val`, whereas the original code fragment calls the `fn` function with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fn` function with two arguments, `key` and `val`, whereas the original code fragment calls the `fn` function with no arguments.

DONE.
