  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Q` namespace, which is not defined in the current scope. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Q` namespace, which is not defined in the current scope. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Q` namespace, which is not defined in the current scope. Replacing it with an anonymous function would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
