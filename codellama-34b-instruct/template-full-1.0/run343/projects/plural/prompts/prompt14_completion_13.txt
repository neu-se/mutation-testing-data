  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment `0` would return the first character of the word, while `1` would return the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `i`th character of the word, while the original fragment would return the first `i` characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(i, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting at the `i`th character and ending at the second-to-last character of the word, while the original fragment would return the substring starting at the `i`th character and ending at the last character.

DONE.
