  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` expects a value, but `undefined` is not a valid value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` expects a value, but `null` is not a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` expects a value, but `0` is not a valid value.

DONE.
