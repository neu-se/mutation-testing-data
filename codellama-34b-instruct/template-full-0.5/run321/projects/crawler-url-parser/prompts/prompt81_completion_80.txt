  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now looking for the `src` attribute instead of the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href', 'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now looking for both the `href` and `src` attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' || 'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now looking for either the `href` or `src` attribute, depending on which one exists.

DONE.
