  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function, but with the `next` argument passed as the first argument. The new code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function, but with the `next` argument passed as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function, but with the `next` argument passed as the first argument. The new code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to the `continuer` function, but with the `throw` argument passed as the second argument.

Option 3
