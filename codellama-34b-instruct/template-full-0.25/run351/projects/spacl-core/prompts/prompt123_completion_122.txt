  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Matcher.test()` returns a boolean indicating whether the matcher matches the given string, whereas `Matcher` itself is a regular expression object that can be used to perform matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.exec(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Matcher.exec()` returns an array of matches, whereas `Matcher` itself is a regular expression object that can be used to perform matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.match(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Matcher.match()` returns an array of matches, whereas `Matcher` itself is a regular expression object that can be used to perform matches.

DONE.
