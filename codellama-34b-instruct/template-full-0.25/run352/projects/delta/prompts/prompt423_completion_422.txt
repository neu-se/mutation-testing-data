  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract the offset from the index, regardless of whether the next type is 'delete' or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the length by the index, which would result in a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the index from the offset, which would result in a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
