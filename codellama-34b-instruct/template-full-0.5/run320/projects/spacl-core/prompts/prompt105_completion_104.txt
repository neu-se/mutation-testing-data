  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid policy name, and the `get()` method would return `undefined` instead of a `Policy` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid policy name, and the `get()` method would return `null` instead of a `Policy` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid policy name, and the `get()` method would return `undefined` instead of a `Policy` object.

DONE.
