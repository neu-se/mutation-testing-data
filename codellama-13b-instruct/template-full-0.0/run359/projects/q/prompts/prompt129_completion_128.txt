  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `key` variable to the `keys` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the `key` variable to the `keys` array and then returns the `keys` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `key` variable to the `keys` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the `key` variable plus one to the `keys` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the `key` variable to the `keys` array, while the modified code fragment pushes the `key` variable minus one to the `keys` array.

DONE.
