  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).send
```
This would result in different behavior because `send` is a different method that may have different behavior and arguments than `dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).receive
```
This would result in different behavior because `receive` is a different method that may have different behavior and arguments than `dispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different method that may have different behavior and arguments than `dispatch`.

DONE.
