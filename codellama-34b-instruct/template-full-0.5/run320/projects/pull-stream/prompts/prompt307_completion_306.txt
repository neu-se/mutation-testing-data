  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the value of `ended`, which is a boolean, instead of the expected `err` or `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `ended` as the first argument, which is a boolean, instead of the expected `err` or `data`.

DONE.
