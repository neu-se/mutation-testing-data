 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.push('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes an empty string to `retDelta`, which is not equivalent to deleting an operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` to `retDelta`, which is not equivalent to deleting an operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.push(new Op());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a new `Op` object to `retDelta`, which is not equivalent to deleting an operation.

Please note that these changes are made to test the effectiveness of the test suite and should not be used in production code.

DONE.
