  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'geese', indicating that the word should be pluralized, but the new code fragment is 'goose', indicating that the word should not be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'geese', indicating that the word should be pluralized, but the new code fragment is 'gooses', indicating that the word should be pluralized differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'geese', indicating that the word should be pluralized, but the new code fragment is 'goose's', indicating that the word should be pluralized differently.

DONE.
