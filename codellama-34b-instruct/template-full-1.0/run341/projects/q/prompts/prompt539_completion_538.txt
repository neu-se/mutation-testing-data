  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise that resolves to `true`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a promise that resolves to `false`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the value of `this.value`, which may not be the correct or expected behavior.

DONE.
