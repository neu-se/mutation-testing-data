  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is present in the `unhandledRejections` array, while this replacement checks the length of the array, which may be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is present in the `unhandledReasons` array, while this replacement checks the length of the array, which may be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is present in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, while this replacement checks the length of the array, which may be different.

DONE.
