  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a string, and `name === undefined` would always be false, even if `name` is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.length` would be 0 if `name` is an empty string, but it would be non-zero if `name` is a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.trim()` would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from `name`, so if `name` is an empty string or contains only whitespace, it would be equivalent to `''`.

DONE.
