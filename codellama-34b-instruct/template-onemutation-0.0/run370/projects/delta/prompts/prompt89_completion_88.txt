  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `newOp.attributes` is an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
