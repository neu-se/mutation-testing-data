  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is checked to be non-null, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `attributes` property is an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `attributes` object is checked to be greater than 0, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `attributes` object is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes.length === 0
```
