  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the timezone object to the `prev` object, instead of replacing it as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the timezone object to the `prev` object at the specified key, instead of replacing it as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = { ...tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to the `prev` object at the specified key, instead of replacing it as in the original code.

DONE.
