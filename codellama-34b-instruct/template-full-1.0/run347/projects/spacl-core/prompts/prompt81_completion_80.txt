  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the space character " " is added to the path, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` for a query with a space character at the end of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new clone of the rule would be created, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` for a query with a clone of a rule that doesn't match the original policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>,)
```
This would result in different behavior because a tuple with the path as the first element would be created, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` for a query with a tuple that doesn't match the original policy.

DONE.
