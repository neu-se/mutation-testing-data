  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means that the chunk does not contain any newlines. In contrast, the new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is greater than -1, which means that the chunk contains at least one newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means that the chunk does not contain any newlines. In contrast, the new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is 0, which means that the chunk contains a newline at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks
