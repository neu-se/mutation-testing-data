  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a node-style callback function, which is then passed to `setTimeout()`. In contrast, this modified code fragment would simply call `deferred.reject()` with the error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately without waiting for the timeout to elapse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a node-style callback function, which is then passed to `setTimeout()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

deferred.notify(error);
