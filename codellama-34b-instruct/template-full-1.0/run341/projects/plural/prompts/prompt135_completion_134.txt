  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/(\w+)$/, '$1es')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pluralize words that end in a consonant, such as "bus" to "buses", instead of "busses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's' + word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra "s" to the end of the word, resulting in pluralization of words that do not follow the general rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/([^s])$/, '$1s')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pluralize words that end in a consonant, such as "bus" to "busses", instead of "buses", and it would pluralize words that end in a vowel, such as "dog" to "dogss", rather than "dogs".

DONE.
