  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function takes a single argument, but the replacement code has two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function computes the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while `Math.sin` computes the sine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code adds 1 to the result of the `cosh` function, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
