  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer split the URL path on forward slashes, potentially causing incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\s+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the URL path on whitespace instead of forward slashes, potentially causing incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\b"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the URL path on word boundaries instead of forward slashes, potentially causing incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
