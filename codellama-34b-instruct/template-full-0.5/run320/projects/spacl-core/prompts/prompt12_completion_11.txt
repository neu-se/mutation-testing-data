  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if a string is a substring of another string, while `match` checks if a string matches a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` finds the index of the first occurrence of a regular expression in a string, while `match` checks if a string matches a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').length
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, and `length` returns the length of an array.

DONE.
