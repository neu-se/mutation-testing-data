  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isObject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.isObject` checks if the argument is a plain object, while `isObject` checks if it's an instance of `Object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the argument, while `isObject` returns a boolean indicating whether the argument is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if the argument is an instance of a particular constructor, while `isObject` checks if it's an instance of `Object`.

DONE.
