  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `latitude` property is not guaranteed to exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `longitude` property is not guaranteed to exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `coordinates` property is not guaranteed to exist.

DONE.
