 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / x['re'], x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the result would be inverted, and the imaginary part would remain unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x['re'] * 0, x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the result would always be zero, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x['re'], x['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result would be doubled, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
