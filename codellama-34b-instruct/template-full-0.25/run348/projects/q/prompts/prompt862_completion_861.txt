  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be increased by 1 millisecond.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be decreased by 1 millisecond.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be doubled.

DONE.
