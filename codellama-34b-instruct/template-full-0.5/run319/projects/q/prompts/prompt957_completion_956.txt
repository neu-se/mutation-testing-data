  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, whereas `Q(bound)` is a method that wraps a function in a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, whereas `Q(bound)` is a method that wraps a function in a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, whereas `Q(bound)` is a method that wraps a function in a promise.

DONE.
