  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
qFileName + `-${lineNumber}`;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the input string concatenated with `'-'` and the line number, regardless of whether the input string matches the expected pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lineNumber - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the line number, regardless of whether the input string matches the expected pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lineNumber + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the line number, regardless of whether the input string matches the expected pattern.

DONE.
