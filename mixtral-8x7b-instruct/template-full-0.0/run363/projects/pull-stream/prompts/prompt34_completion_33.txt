 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0, 1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the first element of `ref`, which would not modify the original `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `ref` array and returns it, modifying the original `ref` array.

DONE.
