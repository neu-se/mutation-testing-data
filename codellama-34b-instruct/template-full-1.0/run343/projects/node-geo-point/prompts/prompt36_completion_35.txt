  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the sine of the angle instead of the cosine, which would give a different value for the hypotenuse of the right triangle and a different distance value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the tangent of the angle instead of the cosine, which would give a different value for the hypotenuse of the right triangle and a different distance value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calculating the distance in radians instead of degrees, which would give a different value for the hypotenuse of the right triangle and a different distance value.

DONE.
