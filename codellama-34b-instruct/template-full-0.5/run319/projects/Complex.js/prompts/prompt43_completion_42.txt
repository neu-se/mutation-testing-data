  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a valid value in JavaScript, but the original code fragment would not consider it as a valid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a valid value in JavaScript, but the original code fragment would not consider it as a valid input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === null || a === -Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `-Infinity` is a valid value in JavaScript, but the original code fragment would not consider it as a valid input.

DONE.
