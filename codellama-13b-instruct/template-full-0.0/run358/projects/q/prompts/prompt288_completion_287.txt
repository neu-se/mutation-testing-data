  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(value)` function returns a promise that is immediately resolved with the given value, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `Q(value)` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject(reason)` function returns a promise that is immediately rejected with the given reason, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason of the `Q.reject(reason)` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve(value)` function returns a promise that is immediately resolved with the given value, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the `Q.resolve(value)` function.

DONE.
