  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments. By replacing it with `onAbort()`, we are calling the function immediately, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this, abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `onAbort`, which is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments. By replacing it with `onAbort.call(this, abort, cb)`, we are calling the function with a different context (`this`) and arguments (`abort` and `cb`), which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(this, abort, cb)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the
