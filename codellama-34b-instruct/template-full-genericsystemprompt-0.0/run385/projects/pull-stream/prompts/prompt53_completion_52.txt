  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is an object, but not necessarily a plain object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` is a function, but not necessarily a sink function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.sink && typeof s.sink === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `s` has a `sink` property that is a function, but not necessarily a sink function.

DONE.
