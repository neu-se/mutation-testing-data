  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the original code fragment uses the truthy value of `args` to determine whether to call `deferred.reject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a truthy value, and the original code fragment uses the truthy value of `args` to determine whether to call `deferred.reject`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is a truthy value, and the original code fragment uses the truthy value of `args` to determine whether to call `deferred.reject`.

DONE.
