  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one more character from the word than the original code fragment, which could cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove two more characters from the word than the original code fragment, which could cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove three more characters from the word than the original code fragment, which could cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

DONE.
