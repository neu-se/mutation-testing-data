  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: null, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `stack` property to a new value, but this replacement code sets it to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: undefined, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `stack` property to a new value, but this replacement code sets it to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{configurable: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `stack` property to be configurable, but this replacement code sets it to be non-configurable.

DONE.
