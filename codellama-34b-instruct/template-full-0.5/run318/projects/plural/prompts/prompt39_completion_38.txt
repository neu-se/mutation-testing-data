  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ys' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the ending of the word to "ys" instead of "ices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the ending of the word to "es" instead of "ices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the ending of the word to "s" instead of "ices".

DONE.
