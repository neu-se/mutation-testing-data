  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was retaining the length of the `otherOp`, which is the operation from the other Delta, while this code fragment is retaining the length of the `thisOp`, which is the operation from the current Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was retaining the length of the `thisOp`, which is the operation from the current Delta, while this code fragment is retaining the length of the `otherOp`, which is the operation from the other Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was retaining the length of the `thisOp` and `
