  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('celo', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` would be called with a different first argument, which would not match any of the existing rules and would therefore return the default value of appending `s` to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('celle', 'cell')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` would be called with a different second argument, which would not match any of the existing rules and would therefore return the default value of appending `s` to the input word.
