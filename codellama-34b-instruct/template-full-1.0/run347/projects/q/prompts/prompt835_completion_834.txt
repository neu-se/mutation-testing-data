  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && process && typeof process === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if `process.domain` is truthy, rather than if `process` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== null && process && typeof process === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if `process.domain` is not null, rather than just truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined" && process.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if `process` is undefined, rather than an object.

DONE.
