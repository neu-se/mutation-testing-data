Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called with `null` instead of the original `value`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `then` method, which may lead to the fulfillment callback being called with an undefined value, altering the expected flow of the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with a new error instead of resolving it with the original `value`, changing the outcome of the promise handling.

DONE.
