  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments, Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would pass a random value as the third argument to the `callback` function, which may not be what the original author intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would pass `null` as the first argument to the `callback` function, which may not be what the original author intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments, new Error("Injected error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would pass a new error object as the third argument to the `callback` function, which may not be what the original author intended.

DONE.
