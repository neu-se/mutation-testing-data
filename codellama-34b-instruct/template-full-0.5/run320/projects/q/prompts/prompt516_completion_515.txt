  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function(error) {
    return error.message;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {
    return "done";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
