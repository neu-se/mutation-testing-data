  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a country object, while the replaced code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a country object, while the replaced code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { ...countries[id], id: 'INVALID' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a country object with the correct id, while the replaced code fragment returns a country object with an invalid id.

DONE.
