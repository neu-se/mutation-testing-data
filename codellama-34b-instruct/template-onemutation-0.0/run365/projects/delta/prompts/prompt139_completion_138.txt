  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. Using `peekLength()` instead of `peekType()` would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is an insert or delete operation.

DONE.
