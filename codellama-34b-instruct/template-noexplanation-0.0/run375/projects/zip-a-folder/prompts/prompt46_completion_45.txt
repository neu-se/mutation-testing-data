  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This change will cause the `directory` method to always return `true`, even if the directory does not exist or is not accessible. This could cause the `zip` and `tar` methods to produce incorrect results or fail with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `directory` method to always return `null`, even if the directory exists and is accessible. This could cause the `zip` and `tar` methods to produce incorrect results or fail with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `directory` method to always return `undefined`, even if the directory exists and is accessible. This could cause the `zip` and `tar` methods to produce incorrect results or fail with an error.

DONE.
