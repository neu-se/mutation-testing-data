  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, while `join` concatenates the elements of an array into a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `join` concatenates them in their original order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.sort
```
This would result in different behavior because `sort` sorts the elements of the array, while `join` concatenates them in their original order.

DONE.
