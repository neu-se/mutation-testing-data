  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
+ otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because using `length` instead of `<PLACEHOLDER>` would cause the `next` method to increment the iterator's current position to the end of the current operation, effectively skipping over any remaining operations in the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
+ otherIter.next(0));
```
This would result in different behavior because using `0` instead of `<PLACEHOLDER>` would cause the `next` method to return the current operation and increment the iterator's current position by `length` if the current operation is a 'retain' operation, whereas using `<PLACEHOLDER>` would always return the current operation and increment the iterator's current position by `1` regardless of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
