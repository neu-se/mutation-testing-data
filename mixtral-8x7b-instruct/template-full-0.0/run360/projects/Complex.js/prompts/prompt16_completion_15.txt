 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 *
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying 0 by any number results in 0, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result when `a` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result when `a` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns e raised to the power of a number, which would cause the function to return an incorrect result when `a` is 0.

DONE.
