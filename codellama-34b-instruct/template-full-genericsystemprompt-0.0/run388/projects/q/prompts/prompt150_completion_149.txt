  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first 10 characters of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the entire stack trace to uppercase, rather than leaving it as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in the stack trace, rather than leaving it as is.

DONE.
