  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `extractFilename`. This would cause the code to always execute the branch that sets the `dest` property of the `options` object, even if the `dest` property was already set.

DONE.
