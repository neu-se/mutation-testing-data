  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasStacks` variable is removed, which would cause the code to always evaluate to `true` regardless of whether the `promise.stack` property exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack &&
        hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasStacks` variable is added back in, but it is now being ANDed with the rest of the conditions, which would cause the code to only evaluate to `true` if all of the conditions are met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack ||
        hasStacks
