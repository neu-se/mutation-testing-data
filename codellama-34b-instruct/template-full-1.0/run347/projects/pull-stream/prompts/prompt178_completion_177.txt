  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, cb, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the arguments in a different order, which could cause a different behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `abort` argument in a different position, which could cause a different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with an additional argument (`true`), which could cause a different behavior in the code.

DONE.
