  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database, while this new code emits the `'load'` event with a constant value of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database, while this new code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database, while this new code emits the `'load'` event with the number of keys in the database multiplied by 4.

DONE.
