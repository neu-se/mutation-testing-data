  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + length
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation in the iterator, while adding `length` would make the resulting expression longer than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `offset` refers to the offset of the current operation in the iterator, while adding `otherIter.peekLength` would make the resulting expression longer than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - length
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting `length` from `peekLength()` would make the resulting expression shorter than the original code fragment.

DONE.
