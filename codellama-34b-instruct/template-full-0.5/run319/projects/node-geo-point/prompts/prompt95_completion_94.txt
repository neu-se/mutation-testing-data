  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the value of sinφ2 would cause the value of φ2 to be greater than 1, which would result in an invalid value for φ2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the value of sinφ2 would cause the value of φ2 to be less than -1, which would result in an invalid value for φ2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 to the value of sinφ2 would cause the value of φ2 to be greater than 1, which would result in an invalid value for φ2.

DONE.
