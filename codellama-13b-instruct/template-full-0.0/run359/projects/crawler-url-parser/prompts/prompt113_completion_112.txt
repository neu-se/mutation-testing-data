  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator of the keys in the `urlMap` object, whereas the `values()` method returns an iterator of the values in the `urlMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator of key-value pairs in the `urlMap` object, whereas the `values()` method returns an iterator of the values in the `urlMap` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.forEach()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach()` method iterates over the key-value pairs in the `urlMap` object and executes a provided function once for each pair, whereas the `values()` method returns an iterator of the values in the `urlMap` object.

DONE.
