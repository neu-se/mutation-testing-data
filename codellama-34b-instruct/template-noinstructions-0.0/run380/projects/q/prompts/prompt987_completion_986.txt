  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, deferred.makeNodeResolver()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not part of the original code fragment, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly tested for this specific case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function() {}` is not the same as the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly tested for this specific case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly tested for this specific case.

DONE.
