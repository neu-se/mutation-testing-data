  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['longitude']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the existence of a "longitude" property on the object, rather than checking for the property on the object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.longitude != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the "longitude" property of the object is not undefined, rather than checking if the property is present on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.longitude != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the "longitude" property of the object is not null, rather than checking if the property is present on the object.

DONE.
