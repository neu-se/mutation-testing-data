  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with the `href` and `baseUrl` arguments in a different order than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrl, href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with the `baseUrl` and `href` arguments in a different order than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with only one argument, `href`, instead of two arguments, `href` and `baseUrl`, as in the original code.

DONE.
