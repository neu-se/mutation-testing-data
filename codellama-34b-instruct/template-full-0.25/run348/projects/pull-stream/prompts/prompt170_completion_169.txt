  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with `true` as an argument, indicating that the iteration is complete, while the mutated code fragment would call the `cb` function with `false` as an argument, indicating that the iteration is not complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and the current value of `array[i++]` as the second argument, while the mutated code fragment would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument and the current value of `array[i++]` as the second argument, but with the `i++` increment operator added to the end of the expression, which would cause the `i` variable to be incremented before the `cb` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
