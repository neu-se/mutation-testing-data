  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the exception, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would create a new rejected promise with the exception, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the existing promise with the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception` would throw the exception, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the exception.

DONE.
