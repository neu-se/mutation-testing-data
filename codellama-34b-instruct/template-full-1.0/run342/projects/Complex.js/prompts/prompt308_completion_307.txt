  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be computing `cosh(2 * a)`, which is different from `cosh(2 * b)` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be computing `cosh(b + 1)`, which is different from `cosh(2 * b)` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be computing `cosh(a - b)`, which is different from `cosh(2 * b)` in the original code.

DONE.
