  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read permission, while this replacement checks for write permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read permission, while this replacement checks for execute permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read permission, while this replacement checks for the existence of the file.

DONE.
