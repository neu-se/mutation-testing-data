  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `true` would cause the `invert` method to always return `null`, regardless of the input attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `false` would cause the `invert` method to always return the input attributes, regardless of their values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, Math.random() > 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `Math.random() > 0.5` would cause the `invert` method to randomly return either the input attributes or `null`, depending on the random value generated.

DONE.
