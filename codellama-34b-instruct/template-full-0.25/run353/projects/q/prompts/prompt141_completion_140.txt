  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment uses the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array, while the original code fragment uses the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array by filtering the elements of the original array, while the original code fragment uses the original array.

DONE.
