  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word 'chilli' specifically, while this new code fragment would check for 'chillis'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word 'chilli' specifically, while this new code fragment would check for 'chillies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word 'chilli' specifically, while this new code fragment would check for 'chillis'.

DONE.
