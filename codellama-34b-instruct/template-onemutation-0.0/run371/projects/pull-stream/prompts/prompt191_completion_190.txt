  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `prop`, which is a function that returns the value of the `prop` property of the object it is called on. In the original code, `prop` is called on the `map` function, which is passed as an argument to the `asyncMap` function. If `map` is not a function, then `prop` will return `undefined`, and the `!` operator will negate that value, resulting in `true`. This means that the `if` statement that checks whether `map` is a function will evaluate to `true`, even if `map` is not a function.

DONE.
