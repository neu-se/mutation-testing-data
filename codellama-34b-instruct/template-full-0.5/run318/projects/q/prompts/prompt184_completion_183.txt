  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a number, but the replaced code fragment returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a number, but the replaced code fragment returns null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a number, but the replaced code fragment returns undefined.

DONE.
