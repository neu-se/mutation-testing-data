 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', archiverOptions: zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zipAFolderOptions` is directly passed to `archiverOptions` instead of having the `compression` property extracted. This would cause the `zip` method to behave differently than the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
