  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and `Object(undefined)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and `Object(null)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not an object, and `Object(NaN)` would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
