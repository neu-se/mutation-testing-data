  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence. In this case, `lastIndexOf` would return the index of the last newline character in the stack trace, which may be different from the first newline character, leading to a different stack trace being generated.

DONE.
