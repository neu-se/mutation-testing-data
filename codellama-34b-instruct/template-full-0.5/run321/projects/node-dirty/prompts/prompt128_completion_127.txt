  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is a method that unblocks the stream, allowing data to flow through it, whereas `cork` blocks the stream and prevents data from flowing through it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being passed to the `write` method, which means that the data will not be written to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is being passed to the `write` method, but it is throwing an error instead of handling it.

DONE.
