Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent!== srcParent && destParent!== path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if the destination parent is not equal to the source parent and not equal to the root, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcParent === path.parse(destParent).root
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now only checking if the source parent is equal to the root of the destination parent, ignoring the comparison with the destination parent itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destParent === srcParent || destParent === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now checking if the destination parent is equal to the source parent or equal to the root directory ('/'), which may not be the same as the root of the destination parent.

DONE.
