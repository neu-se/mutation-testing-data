  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, while `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, while `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then()` is used to attach a callback function to a promise, while `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise.

DONE.
