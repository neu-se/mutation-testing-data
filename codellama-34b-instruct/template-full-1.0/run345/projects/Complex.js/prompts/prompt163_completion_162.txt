  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the new code is only checking for `z['isInfinite']()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()`, while the new code is only checking for `this['isInfinite']()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] * z['re'] - this['im'] * z['im'], this['re'] * z['im'] + this['im'] * z['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for whether `this` or `z` was infinite, while the new code is only checking
