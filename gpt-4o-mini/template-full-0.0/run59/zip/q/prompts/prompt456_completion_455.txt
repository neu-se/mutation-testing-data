Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_lastIndexOf` would search for the last occurrence of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the first, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the rejection tracking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the index would cause the function to return an index that is out of bounds if the promise is not found, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to access the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) === 0 ? -1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return -1 if the promise is the first element in the array, causing the rejection to be untracked even when it should be, leading to potential memory leaks or incorrect state management.

DONE.
