  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "chilli" with two "l"s, while the new code fragment uses the word "chili" with one "l".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "chilli" with two "l"s, while the new code fragment uses the word "chili" with one "l" and adds an extra "s" to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chili', 'chilly'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "chilli" with two "l"s, while the new code fragment uses the word "chili" with one "l" and changes the ending from "ies" to "ly".
