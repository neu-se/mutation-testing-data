  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not a valid object and will likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, args]
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is not a valid object and will likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This change will cause the `dispatch` method to be called with only one argument, which is not a valid object and will likely cause an error.

DONE.
