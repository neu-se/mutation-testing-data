 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive null as the second argument instead of an object, which would cause an error in the AttributeMap.invert() method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive an empty object as the second argument instead of the actual attributes of the baseOp, which would cause the inverted attributes to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the AttributeMap.invert() method would receive the attributes of the current operation (thisOp) instead of the base operation, which would cause the inverted attributes to be incorrect.

DONE.
