  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb`, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. In contrast, the new code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb` that is initialized with an arrow function that takes no arguments and returns an empty object. This change would cause the `cb` function to behave differently when it is called, which could potentially affect the behavior of the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = (err) => { throw err; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb`, which is a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. In contrast, the new code fragment is using the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable `cb` that is initialized with an arrow function that takes an `err` argument and throws an error if
