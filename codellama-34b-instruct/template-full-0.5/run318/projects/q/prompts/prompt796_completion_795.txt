  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressed` function with the promise's rejection reason as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressed` function with the promise's fulfillment value as an argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call an empty function with no arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
