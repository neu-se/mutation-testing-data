  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `a`, while this code checks for equality between `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `a`, while this code performs an addition operation between `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the type of `a`, while this code performs a multiplication operation between `a` and `b`.

DONE.
