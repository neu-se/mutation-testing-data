  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` function would be called with `void 0` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being resolved with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
