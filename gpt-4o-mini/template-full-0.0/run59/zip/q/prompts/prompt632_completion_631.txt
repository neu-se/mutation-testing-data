Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly attempts to delete a property while also passing the value as an argument, which is not the intended use of the delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the property but passes `null` as the second argument, which could lead to unexpected results or errors depending on how the `dispatch` method handles the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the key to delete, which is not a valid property name and would not delete any property, potentially leading to silent failures in the code.

DONE.
