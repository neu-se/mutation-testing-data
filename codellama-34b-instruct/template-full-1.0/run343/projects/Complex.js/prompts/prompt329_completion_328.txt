  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-0.5 * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` would be calculated using the updated value of `b`, which would be different from the original value used in the calculation of `Math.cos(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.5 * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` would be calculated using the updated value of `b`, which would be different from the original value used in the calculation of `Math.cos(b)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(2 * b)` would be calculated using the updated value of `b`, which would be different from the original value used in the calculation of `Math.cos(b)`.

DONE.
