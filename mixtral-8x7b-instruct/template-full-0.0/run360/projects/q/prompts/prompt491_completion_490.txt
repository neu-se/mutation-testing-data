 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function is not called, and the rejection will not be removed from the unhandled rejections list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => null
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is called but it does not remove the rejection from the unhandled rejections list, as the return value is not used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(this) => this
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is called with the wrong context (`this`), which might cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
