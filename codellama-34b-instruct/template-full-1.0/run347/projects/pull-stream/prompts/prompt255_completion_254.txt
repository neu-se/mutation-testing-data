  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read ? nextStream() : nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_read` is truthy, but this new code fragment checks if `_read` is falsy, which could result in `nextChunk()` being called when it wasn't intended to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read && nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_read` is falsy, but this new code fragment checks if `_read` is truthy, which could result in `nextStream()` being called when it wasn't intended to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, nextChunk)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment recursively calls `nextStream` or `nextChunk` until a value is returned, but this new code fragment calls `nextChunk` only once and then returns
