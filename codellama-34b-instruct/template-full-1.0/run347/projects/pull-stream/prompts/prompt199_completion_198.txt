  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` argument to be an object, but passing `null` would cause the function to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` argument to be a non-null object, but passing `undefined` would cause the function to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` argument to have a certain structure, but passing an empty object would not have the same structure and would likely cause the function to error out.

DONE.
