  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is assigned the value 10, which is a constant and not relative to the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is multiplied by 2, which would result in the operation being twice as long.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is incremented by 1, which would result in the operation being longer by 1.

DONE.
