  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, whereas this new fragment checks if `b` is null or undefined. If `b` is an object but has a null prototype, it would be considered not an object in the original fragment but it would be considered null or undefined in the new fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, whereas this new fragment checks if `b` is an array. If `b` is an object but also happens to be an array, the original fragment would consider it an object, while the new fragment would consider it an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object, whereas this new fragment checks
