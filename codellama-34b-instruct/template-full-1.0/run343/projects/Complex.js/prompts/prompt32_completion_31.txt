  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `b != 0` is a comparison operator that checks for inequality, whereas `a === 0` checks for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a non-numeric value and `a !== 0` would be a comparison operator that checks for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ? 0 : b
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional operator `?` would return `b` if `a` is a non-numeric value.

DONE.
