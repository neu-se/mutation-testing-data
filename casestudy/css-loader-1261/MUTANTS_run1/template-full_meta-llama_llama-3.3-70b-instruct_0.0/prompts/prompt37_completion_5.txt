Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `normalizedUrl` to a string using the `+ ''` method, which could potentially change the behavior if `normalizedUrl` is not already a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original `url` instead of the `normalizedUrl`, which could lead to different results if the normalization process changes the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `encodeURI` instead of `unescape`, which could lead to different results if the URL contains special characters that are handled differently by these two functions.

DONE.
