  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an array, but rather an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to a function. Using `arguments` instead of `array_slice(arguments)` would cause the `all` function to return a promise for the `arguments` object instead of an array of the resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a promise for an empty array instead of an array of the resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a promise for an array containing `undefined` instead of an array of the resolved values.

DONE.
