  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `null` is not a string. The `stringify` function would throw an error when trying to convert `null` to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `undefined` is not a string. The `stringify` function would throw an error when trying to convert `undefined` to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `{}` is an object. The `stringify` function would throw an error when trying to convert an object to a string.

DONE.
