  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `arguments` object, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start slicing the `arguments` object from the second element instead of the first, which would exclude one of the arguments from the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last element of the `arguments` object from the resulting array, which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
