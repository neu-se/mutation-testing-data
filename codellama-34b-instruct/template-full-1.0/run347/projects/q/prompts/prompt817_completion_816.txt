  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately instead of resolving with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` method to be called with a progress notification instead of a resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Oops!')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error instead of resolving with a value.

DONE.
