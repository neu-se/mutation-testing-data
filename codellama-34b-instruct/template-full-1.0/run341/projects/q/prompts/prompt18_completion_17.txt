  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give a different value for `head.task` and potentially cause a crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give a different value for `head.task` and potentially cause a crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give a different value for `head.task` and potentially cause a crash.

DONE.
