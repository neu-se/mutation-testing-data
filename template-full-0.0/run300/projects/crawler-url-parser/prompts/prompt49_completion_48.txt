  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument would cause the `resolve` method to always return an absolute URL, even if the input URL is already absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `resolve` method to always return a relative URL, even if the input URL is already absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl, parsedUrl.protocol === 'http:')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedUrl.protocol === 'http:'` condition would cause the `resolve` method to return an absolute URL only if the input URL has the `http` protocol, and a relative URL otherwise.

DONE.
