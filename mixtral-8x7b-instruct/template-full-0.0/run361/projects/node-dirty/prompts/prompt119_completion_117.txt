 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator used is different, which could lead to a failure in detecting an empty queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._queue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of checking the properties has changed, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the queue has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.has(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a `null` value in the queue, instead of checking if the queue is empty. This could lead to incorrect handling of the queue's state.

DONE.
