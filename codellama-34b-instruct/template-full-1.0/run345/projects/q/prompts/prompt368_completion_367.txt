  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `_resolved` would be called instead of `_rejected`, which would return a different value and possibly cause the code to take a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called instead of `_rejected`, which would return a different value and possibly cause the code to take a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown, which would change the execution path of the code.

DONE.
