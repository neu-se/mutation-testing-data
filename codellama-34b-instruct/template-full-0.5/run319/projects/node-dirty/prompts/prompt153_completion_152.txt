  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will close the write stream, whereas `uncork()` will allow data to flow again after it was paused.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` will write an empty string to the stream, whereas `uncork()` will allow data to flow again after it was paused.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` will close the write stream and cause any pending writes to fail, whereas `uncork()` will allow data to flow again after it was paused.

DONE.
