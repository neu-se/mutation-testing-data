  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 2999 && _b < 2999
```
This would result in different behavior because the constants are different, and the logic would be slightly different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is different, and the logic would be reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(_a, _b) < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic is reversed, and the operator is different.

DONE.
