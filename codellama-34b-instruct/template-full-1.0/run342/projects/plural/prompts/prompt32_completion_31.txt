  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to match both "thesis" and "crisis" instead of just "thesis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crises/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of "s" to "crisis" would cause the regular expression to match both "thesis" and "crises" instead of just "thesis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/theses|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would
