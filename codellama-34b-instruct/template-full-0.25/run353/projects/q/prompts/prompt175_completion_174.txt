  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` returns the new length of the array, whereas `join` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `join` concatenates them into a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, whereas `join` concatenates the elements into a string.

DONE.
