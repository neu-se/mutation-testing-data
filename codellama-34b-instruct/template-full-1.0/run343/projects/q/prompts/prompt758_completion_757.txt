  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anySettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "anySettled" is not a recognized method in the Q library, while "allSettled" is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allRejected" is not a recognized method in the Q library, while "allSettled" is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"noneSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "noneSettled" is not a recognized method in the Q library, while "allSettled" is.

DONE.
