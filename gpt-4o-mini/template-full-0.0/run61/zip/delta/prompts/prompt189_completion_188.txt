Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the attributes of the new operation to `null`, potentially losing important metadata that should be preserved during the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = thisOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assign the attributes from `thisOp` instead of combining the attributes from both `thisOp` and `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the resulting operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...otherOp.attributes };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of `otherOp.attributes`, ignoring the need to merge attributes from both operations, which could lead to loss of information or incorrect attribute handling.

DONE.
