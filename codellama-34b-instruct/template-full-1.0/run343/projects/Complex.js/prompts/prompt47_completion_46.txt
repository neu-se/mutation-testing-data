  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a['abs'] === 'function' && typeof a['arg'] === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, and in this case, it would check if the properties `abs` and `arg` of object `a` are functions rather than checking if they exist and are not functions as the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && typeof a['arg'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would check if the property `arg` is a number, rather than checking if it exists and is not a function as the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!('abs' in a) && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would check if the property `abs` does not exist and the property `arg` does exist
