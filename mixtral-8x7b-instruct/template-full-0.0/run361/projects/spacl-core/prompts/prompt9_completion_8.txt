 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[/][/]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a character class `[/]` instead of a literal `/`, which would match any single character that is either a forward slash or not a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/\\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a double backslash `\\` to escape the first forward slash, which would match a literal backslash followed by a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/[*][/]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a character class `[*]` to match a literal asterisk or not an asterisk, followed by a forward slash, which would match any string that contains an asterisk followed by a forward slash.

DONE.
