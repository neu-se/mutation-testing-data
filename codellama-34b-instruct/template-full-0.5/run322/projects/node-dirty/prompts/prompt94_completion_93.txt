  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the input object, while `JSON.parse` parses a string representation of JSON and returns the corresponding object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(rowStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(rowStr))` would parse the string representation of the `rowStr` object, which would result in a different object than the original `rowStr` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because `rowStr.split(':')` would split the `rowStr` string into an array of strings, while `JSON.parse` would parse the string representation of JSON and return the corresponding object.

DONE.
