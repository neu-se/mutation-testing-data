  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different method than "post", and the arguments passed to it are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).success
```
This would result in different behavior because "success" is a different method than "fail", and the arguments passed to it are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because "then" is a different method than "fail", and the arguments passed to it are different.

DONE.
