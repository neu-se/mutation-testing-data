  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the new operation is added to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the new operation is added to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method than `push`, and it would change the way the new operation is added to the delta.

DONE.
