Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the calculation of the bearing by adding 1 to the `y` value, which would change the angle returned by the `atan2` function, potentially leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation to use the sum of `x` and `y` instead of just `y`, which would significantly affect the angle calculated by `atan2`, leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the calculation to subtract `y` from `x`, which would also change the angle returned by `atan2`, resulting in an incorrect bearing value.

DONE.
