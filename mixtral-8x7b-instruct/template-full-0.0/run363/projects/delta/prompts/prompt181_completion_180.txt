 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.next.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `otherIter.next()` without any context, which may cause issues if `otherIter.next()` relies on the context (`this`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of calling the `otherIter.next()` method, causing the code to deviate from the intended functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter['next']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `next` property as if it were a regular property instead of invoking it as a method, which may cause issues if the `next` property relies on being called as a method.

DONE.
