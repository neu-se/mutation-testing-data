 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is used instead of a deferred object, and the `deferred.resolve()` method would not be available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, and the `deferred.resolve()` method would not be available to resolve the returned promise with the correct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
