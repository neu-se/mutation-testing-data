  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `value == null` would cause the `else` branch to be taken, even if `value` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof value === 'undefined'` would cause the `else` branch to be taken, even if `value` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `value === undefined` would cause the `else` branch to be taken, even if `value` is `undefined`.

DONE.
