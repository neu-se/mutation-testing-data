  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches any character "a", while the original code fragment `/^(?:wo)?man$/i` matches the string "man" or "woman" at the beginning of a line, regardless of case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?:wo)?man$/i` matches the string "man" or "woman" at the beginning of a line, regardless of case, while the original code fragment `/a/, 'e'` matches any character "a" and replaces it with "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/wo?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/wo?man$/i` matches the string "man" or "woman" at the end of a
