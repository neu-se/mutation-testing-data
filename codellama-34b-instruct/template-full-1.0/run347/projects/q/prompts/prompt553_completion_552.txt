  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the fulfilled promise, while this new code fragment returns the value of the fulfilled promise plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the fulfilled promise, while this new code fragment returns the value of the fulfilled promise minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the fulfilled promise, while this new code fragment returns the value of the fulfilled promise multiplied by two.

DONE.
