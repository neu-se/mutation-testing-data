  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true` even if `end` is not `true`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true` even if `end` is not `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` set to `true` even if `end` is not `undefined`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
