 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ref` array, so the original `ref` array is not modified when `ref.unshift(read)` is called in the `default` case. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the calling code relies on the original `ref` array being mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `length` property of `null`. This could lead to the function failing to execute properly if the `length` of `ref` is greater than 4.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `length` property of an empty object. This could
