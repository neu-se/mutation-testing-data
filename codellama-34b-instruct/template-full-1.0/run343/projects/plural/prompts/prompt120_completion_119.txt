  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w[0]; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be the first character of the input word, rather than the entire word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be the input word with the first character removed, rather than the entire word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.charAt(w.length - 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be the last character of the input word, rather than the entire word.

DONE.
