  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `sin(φ2)` would cause the result to be negative, which would change the sign of the result of the `acos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `cos(φ2)` would cause the result to be positive, which would change the sign of the result of the `acos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `cos(φ2)` would cause the result to be negative, which would change the sign of the result of the `acos` function.

DONE.
