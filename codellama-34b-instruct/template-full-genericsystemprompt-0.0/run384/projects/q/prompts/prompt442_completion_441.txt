  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be "unhandledRejectionfoo" instead of "unhandledRejection".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be "unhandledRejection1" instead of "unhandledRejection".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name would be "unhandledRejectionbar" instead of "unhandledRejection".

DONE.
