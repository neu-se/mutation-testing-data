  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length()` is a method call that returns the length of the line, while `line.length` is a property that returns the length of the line as a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.size()` is a method call that returns the size of the line, while `line.length` is a property that returns the length of the line as a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.count()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.count()` is a method call that returns the number of characters in the line, while `line.length` is a property that returns the length of the line as a number.

DONE.
