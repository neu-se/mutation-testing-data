Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.*\/$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for an empty string before the final slash, which would incorrectly validate paths that should not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow paths that end with a slash, as it checks for the opposite condition of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the string is non-empty, ignoring whether it ends with a slash, thus allowing invalid paths that should be rejected.

DONE.
