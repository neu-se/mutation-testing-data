  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `ops` array instead of the current element. This could cause the `next()` method to return an incorrect value, potentially leading to bugs in the code that relies on the `Iterator` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `ops` array instead of the current element. This could cause the `next()` method to return an incorrect value, potentially leading to bugs in the code that relies on the `Iterator` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a different element in the `ops` array based on the current index. This could cause the `next()` method to return an incorrect
