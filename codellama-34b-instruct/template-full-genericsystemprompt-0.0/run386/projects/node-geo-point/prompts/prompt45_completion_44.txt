  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 0 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r is greater than 1, while this new code fragment would return 0 if r is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r is greater than 1, while this new code fragment would return 2r.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return 1 if r is greater than 1, while this new code fragment would return r + 1.

DONE.
