  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(end || end) !== true`, which would always be true if `end` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the expression would only be true if `end` is both `null` or `undefined` and `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the expression would be true if `end` is not `true`, regardless of its value.

DONE.
