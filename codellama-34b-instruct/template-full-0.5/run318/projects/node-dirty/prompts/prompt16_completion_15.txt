  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the queue instead of adding to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the queue to null instead of a list of callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [cb]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with only the current callback instead of adding it to the existing array.

DONE.
