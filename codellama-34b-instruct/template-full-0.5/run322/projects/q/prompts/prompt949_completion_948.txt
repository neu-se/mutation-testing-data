  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects the context to be passed as the first argument, while `apply` expects the context to be passed as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the context and arguments bound to it, while `apply` calls the function with the given context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with the given context and arguments, while `bind` creates a new function with the context and arguments bound to it.

DONE.
