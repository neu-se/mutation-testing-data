  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a non-zero value, even if the attributes object is empty, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a non-zero value, even if the attributes object is empty, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a non-zero value, even if the attributes object is empty, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
