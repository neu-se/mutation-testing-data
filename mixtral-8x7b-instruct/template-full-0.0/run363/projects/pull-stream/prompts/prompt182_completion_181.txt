 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the correct arguments to `abortCb`, causing unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to `abortCb`, causing unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, i, array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to `abortCb`, causing unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario.

These changes create different behavior by passing incorrect arguments to the `abortCb` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario. The original code passes `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` to `abortCb`, ensuring proper handling of the abort scenario.

DONE.
