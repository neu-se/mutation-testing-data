  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows using the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows using the carriage return and newline characters. This would cause the code to interpret the buffer differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows using the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows using the newline and carriage return characters. This would cause the code to interpret the buffer differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
