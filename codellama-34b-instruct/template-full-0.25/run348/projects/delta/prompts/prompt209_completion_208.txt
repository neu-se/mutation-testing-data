  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would chop the delta to one character shorter than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the delta's length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would chop the delta to one character longer than the original code, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the delta's length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would chop the delta to twice its original length, which could potentially cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the delta's length.

DONE.
