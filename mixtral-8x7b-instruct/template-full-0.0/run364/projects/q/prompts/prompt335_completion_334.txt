 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function might be undefined, causing an error when trying to access its `state` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the object's default value (in this case, an empty object), instead of the actual state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return {state: "pending"}; }
