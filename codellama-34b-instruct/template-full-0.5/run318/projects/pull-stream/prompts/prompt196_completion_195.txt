  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would only evaluate to `true` if `abort` is a truthy value, whereas the new code fragment `abort || null` would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is a truthy value or if `null` is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would only evaluate to `true` if `abort` is a truthy value, whereas the new code fragment `!abort` would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would only evaluate to `true` if `abort` is a truthy value, whereas the new code fragment `
