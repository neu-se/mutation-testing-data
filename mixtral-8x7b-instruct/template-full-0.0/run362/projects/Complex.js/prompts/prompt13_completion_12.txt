 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b >= x || x >= b
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an off-by-one error in the comparison, which could lead to incorrect results or test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < -b || x > b
