Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is used instead of the `replacer` function, which serves a different purpose in JSON serialization: `reviver` is used to transform the result after parsing, while `replacer` is used to transform the object before stringifying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.replacer` is used instead of `options.replacer`, which could lead to different replacement behavior depending on the context in which `writeFile` is called, as `this` might not refer to the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options ? options.replacer : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional logic is inverted, so when `options` is truthy, `null` is used as the replacer, and when `options` is falsy, `options.replacer` is used, which is likely to cause an error since `options` is falsy.

DONE.
