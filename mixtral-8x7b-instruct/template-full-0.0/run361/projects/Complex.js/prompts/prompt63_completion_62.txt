 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function used to calculate the real part of the complex number would change from cosine to sine, which have different properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the hyperbolic cosine function has different properties than the regular cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by one would change the value of the real part of the complex number, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
