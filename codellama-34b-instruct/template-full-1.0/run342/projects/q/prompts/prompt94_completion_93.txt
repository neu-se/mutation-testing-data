  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index of this
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is not a valid operator in JavaScript, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is not a defined variable in the scope of the code, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, and `index` is not a property of the global object, so it would return `undefined`.

DONE.
