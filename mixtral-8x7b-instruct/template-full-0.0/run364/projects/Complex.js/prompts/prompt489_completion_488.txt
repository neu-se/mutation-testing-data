 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'value': false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `__esModule` property would be set to `false` instead of an object, which could affect how the module is imported and used in other parts of the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'value': 123
