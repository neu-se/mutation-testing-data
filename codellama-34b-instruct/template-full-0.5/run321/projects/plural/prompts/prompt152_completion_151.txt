  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `num` returns the value of the `num` variable, while `num + 1` returns the value of `num` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `num` returns the value of the `num` variable, while `num * 2` returns the value of `num` multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `num` returns the value of the `num` variable, while `num - 1` returns the value of `num` minus 1.

DONE.
