  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
();
```
This would result in different behavior because `()` is an empty function that returns `undefined`, while `Q` is a promise library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number, while `Q` is a promise library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q";
```
This would result in different behavior because `"Q"` is a string, while `Q` is a promise library.

DONE.
