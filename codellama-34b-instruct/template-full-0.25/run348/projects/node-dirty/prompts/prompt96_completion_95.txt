  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is defined on the object itself, whereas `in` checks if the property is defined in the object or its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and `null` is a different value than `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key !== 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` checks for inequality, whereas `===` checks for equality.

DONE.
