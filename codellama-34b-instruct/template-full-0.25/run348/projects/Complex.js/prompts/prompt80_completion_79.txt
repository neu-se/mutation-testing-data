  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` would be used instead of the addition operator `+`, which would cause the function to perform a different operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` would be used instead of the addition operator `+`, which would cause the function to perform a different operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator `/` would be used instead of the addition operator `+`, which would cause the function to perform a different operation.

DONE.
