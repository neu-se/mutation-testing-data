Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.denodeify` function to be called with `null` as the context, which would lead to a runtime error when trying to call methods on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.denodeify` function to be called with `undefined` as the context, which would also lead to a runtime error when trying to call methods on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context to a string, which is not a valid context for method calls, leading to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to invoke methods that expect an object.

DONE.
