  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that will always reject the promise, whereas `fulfill` is a function that will fulfill the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are functions that will resolve or reject the promise, respectively. By wrapping the `reject` function in a `resolve` function, the promise will be resolved with a rejected promise, which is different from resolving the promise with a fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that will reject the promise with the given value, whereas `fulfill` is a function that will fulfill the promise with the given value.

DONE.
