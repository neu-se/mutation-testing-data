  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "sublevel" when the link URL has the same number of path parts as the page URL, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "uplevel" when the link URL has fewer path parts than the page URL, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length == pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "samelevel" when the link URL has the same number of path parts as the page URL, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
