 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype.del` method expects a key as an argument, and passing `null` would cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"splice"
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is not a valid method that can be dispatched to a promise. This would cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects a string (the name of the operation) as the first argument, and passing a function would cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
