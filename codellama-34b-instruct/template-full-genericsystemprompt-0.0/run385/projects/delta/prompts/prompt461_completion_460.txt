  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the current op in the rest of the ops, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next op and include the one after that, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1, this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include only the next op and not the rest of the ops, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
