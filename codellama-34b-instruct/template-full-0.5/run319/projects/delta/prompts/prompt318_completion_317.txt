  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is null or undefined, while this replacement code fragment only checks if `op.attributes` is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.attributes` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is null or undefined, while this replacement code fragment only checks if `op.attributes` is not null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.attributes` is undefined.
