  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not required')
```
This change will cause the function to return a rejected promise with a different error message than the original code, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This change will cause the function to return a rejected promise with the same error message as the original code, which may cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not behaving correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This change will cause the function to return a rejected promise with the same error message as the original code, which may cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not behaving correctly.

DONE.
