  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.NaN` is a special value that represents the result of an invalid operation, and using it in the calculation would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` is a special value that represents the result of a division by zero, and using it in the calculation would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is a special value that represents the result of a division by zero, and using it in the calculation would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
