  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return `'ses'`, even for words that should not have a plural form, such as `'dwarf'` and `'roof'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' && w === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would never return `'ses'`, even for words that should have a plural form, such as `'stereo'` and `'focus'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length > 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return `'ses'`, even for short words that do not have a plural form, such as `'cat'` and `'dog'`.

DONE.
