  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0'
      ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/
      : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is replaced with `===`, which would cause the code to behave differently for certain inputs.
