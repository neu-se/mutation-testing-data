  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp at index 1 instead of index 0, which would change the order of the operations in the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp.insert property instead of the newOp object itself, which could change the behavior of the push method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp.retain property instead of the newOp object itself, which could change the behavior of the push method.

DONE.
