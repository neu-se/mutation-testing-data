  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may not necessarily reject the promise immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may not necessarily reject the promise immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` will create a new deferred object and return a promise that is not yet resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise library and may not necessarily create a new deferred object.

DONE.
