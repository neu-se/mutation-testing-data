  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'somestring'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `data` variable to be a string, and adding a string to it would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not expect the `data` variable to be null, and it would cause a null pointer exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `data` variable to be a string, and an object literal would produce a different output.
