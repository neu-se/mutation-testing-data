Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to incorrectly remove the last character of the word and append 'es' instead of the intended behavior of removing the last two characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove characters from the end of the string in a way that is not valid, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly remove the last two characters of the word, which may not be appropriate for all words that match the regex, leading to incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
