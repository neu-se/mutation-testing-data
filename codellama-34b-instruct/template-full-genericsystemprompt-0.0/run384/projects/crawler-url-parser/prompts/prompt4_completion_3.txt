  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in
