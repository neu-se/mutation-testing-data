  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` would have called the `callback` function, while the new code fragment `undefined` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` would have called the `callback` function, while the new code fragment `null` would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` would have called the `callback` function, while the new code fragment `0` would result in an error.

DONE.
