  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the string "mouse" instead of the entire string "mice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'monkey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the word "monkey" instead of the entire string "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "mice1" instead of the entire string "mice".

DONE.
