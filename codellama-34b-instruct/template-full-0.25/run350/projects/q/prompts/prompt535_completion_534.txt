  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the code to behave differently if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` argument is missing, which could cause the code to behave differently if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` argument is null, which could cause the code to behave differently if the function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
