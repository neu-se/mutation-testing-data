 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result would always be 0, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result would be incorrect, as it would always be equal to the real part of the input complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result would be non-deterministic, depending on the random value generated at runtime.

DONE.
