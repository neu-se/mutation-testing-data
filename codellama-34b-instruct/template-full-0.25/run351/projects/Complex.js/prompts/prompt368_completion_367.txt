  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `b + 1` returns the value of `b` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `a + b` returns the sum of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `a * b` returns the product of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
