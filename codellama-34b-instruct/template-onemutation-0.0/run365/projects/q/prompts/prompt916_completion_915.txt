  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if the `callback` argument is undefined, while the modified code fragment would throw an error in this case.

DONE.
