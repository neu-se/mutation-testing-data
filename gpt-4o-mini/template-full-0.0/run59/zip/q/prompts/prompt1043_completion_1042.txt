Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to retrieve the promise associated with the tail of the queue instead of the head, leading to incorrect values being returned from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head" + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to concatenate the string "head" with "extra", which is not a valid operation in this context, potentially leading to unexpected errors or behavior when trying to resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would not match any valid property of the promise, likely resulting in an error or an undefined value being returned, which would disrupt the expected flow of the queue operations.

DONE.
