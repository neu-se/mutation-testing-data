  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length, num
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is being accessed on `this`, which is not the same object as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the function are being reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, this
```
This would result in different behavior because both arguments to the function are the same object, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
