  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] !== qFileName
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the file name of the stack line is not equal to the file name of the Q function, instead of checking if the file name and line number are not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[1] > qEndingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the line number of the stack line is greater than the ending line number of the Q function, instead of checking if the file name and line number are not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] !== qFileName && fileNameAndLineNumber[1] > qEndingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the file name of the stack line is not equal to the file name of the Q function and the line number of the stack line is greater than the ending line number of the Q function,
