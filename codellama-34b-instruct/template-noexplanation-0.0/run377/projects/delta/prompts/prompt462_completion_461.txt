  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of the `rest` array, except for the first element. This change in behavior will cause the `rest` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, -1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of the `rest` array, except for the last element. This change in behavior will cause the `rest` method to return a different result than the original code, which could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.
