  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `part` is a string, and `part.slice(0, -1)` would return a substring of `part` without the last character, which could cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `part` is a string, and `part.length` would return the length of `part` as a number, which could cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `part` is a string, and `part.charAt(0)` would return the first character of `part` as a string, which could cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.
