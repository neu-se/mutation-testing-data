  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code decrements it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code adds 1 to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i*2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code multiplies it by 2.

DONE.
