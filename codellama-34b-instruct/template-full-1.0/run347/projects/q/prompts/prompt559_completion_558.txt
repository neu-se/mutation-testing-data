  Sure, I can do that. Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(exception) === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and comparing it to a number would always return false, even if the exception was a `StopIteration` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks whether an object is an instance of a class, and `StopIteration` is not a class, it's an error. This would always return false, even if the exception was a `StopIteration` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of an error object is not the
