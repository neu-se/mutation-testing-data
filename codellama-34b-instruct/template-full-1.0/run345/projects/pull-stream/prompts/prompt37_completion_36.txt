  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is accessing the wrong index in the `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is accessing the `i`th index in the `ref` array, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.foobar
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is accessing a non-existent property `foobar` of the `ref` object.

DONE.
