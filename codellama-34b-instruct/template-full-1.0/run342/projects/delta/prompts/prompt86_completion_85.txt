  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<lastOp.length>
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.length` is a method that returns the length of the `lastOp` object, while `lastOp.attributes` is an object property that contains the attributes of the `lastOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<this.lastOp.attributes>
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.lastOp.attributes` refers to the `attributes` property of the `lastOp` object, while `lastOp.attributes` refers to the `attributes` property of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<lastOp.attributes()>
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.attributes()` is a method that returns the attributes of the `lastOp` object, while `lastOp.attributes` is an object property that contains the attributes of the `lastOp` object.

DONE.
