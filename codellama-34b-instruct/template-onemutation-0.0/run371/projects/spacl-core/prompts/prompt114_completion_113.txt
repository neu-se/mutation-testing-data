  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `verbs` array, while the mutated code fragment only uses the first element of the array. This change would cause the `deny` method to only deny the first verb in the `verbs` array, rather than all of them.
