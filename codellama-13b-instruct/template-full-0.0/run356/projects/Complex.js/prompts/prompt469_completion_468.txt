  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `b < 0` is replaced with `b > 0`, which would cause the code to always return the positive imaginary part, regardless of the sign of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `b < 0` is replaced with `b === 0`, which would cause the code to always return the positive imaginary part, regardless of the sign of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `b < 0` is replaced with `b < 0 && a < 0`, which would cause the code to always return the negative imaginary part, regardless of the sign of `b`.

DONE.
