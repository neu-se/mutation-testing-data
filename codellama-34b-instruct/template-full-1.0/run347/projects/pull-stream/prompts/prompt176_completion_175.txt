  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array[0]` is the first element of that array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array.length` is the length of that array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array.map(x => x)` is a new array created by mapping each element of `array` to itself.

DONE.
