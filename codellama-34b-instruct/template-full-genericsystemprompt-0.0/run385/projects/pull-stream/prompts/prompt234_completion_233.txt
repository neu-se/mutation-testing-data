  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data.toUpperCase()` is a string in all uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, while `data.split(' ')[0]` is the first word in the string.

DONE.
