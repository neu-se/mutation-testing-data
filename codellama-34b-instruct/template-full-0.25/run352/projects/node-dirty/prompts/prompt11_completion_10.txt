  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key from a map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value associated with a key. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the code to remove the key from the map instead of retrieving the value associated with it, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a key-value pair in a map, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves the value associated with a key. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set a new key-value pair in the map instead of retrieving the value associated with the existing key, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `
