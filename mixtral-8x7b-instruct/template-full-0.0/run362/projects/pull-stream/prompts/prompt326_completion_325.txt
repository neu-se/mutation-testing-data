 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
through.once
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `once` function defined in the `through` module instead of the inner `once` function. This could lead to unexpected behavior if there are any variables or functions in the inner `once` function's scope that it relies on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the callback to be executed on the next iteration of the event loop, rather than immediately. This could lead to issues with synchronization and ordering of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the callback to be executed on the next iteration of the event loop, but the exact timing is not guaranteed. This could lead to issues with synchronization and ordering of operations.

DONE.
