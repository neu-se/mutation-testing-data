  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(newOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` method returns an array of differences between the two attribute maps, which would cause the `concat` method to behave differently when merging the two operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(newOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method returns an attribute map with the inverted values of the original attribute map, which would cause the `concat` method to behave differently when merging the two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose(newOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method returns an attribute map with the combined values of the original attribute maps, which would cause the `concat` method to behave differently when merging the two operations.

DONE.
