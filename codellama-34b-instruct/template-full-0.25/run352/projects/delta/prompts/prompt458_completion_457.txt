  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property would be set to 1 instead of 0, which would cause the `peekLength()` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index = this.ops.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be set to the last index of the `ops` array instead of the current index, which would cause the `peek()` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` array would be empty instead of containing the original operations, which would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` instead of `true`.

DONE.
