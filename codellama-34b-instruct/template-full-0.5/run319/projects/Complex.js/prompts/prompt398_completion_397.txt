  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.asin(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is a complex function that takes a complex number as input and returns a complex number as output, whereas `acos` is a complex function that takes a complex number as input and returns a complex number as output, but with the input and output values swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.acos(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is a complex function that takes a complex number as input and returns a complex number as output, whereas `asin` is a complex function that takes a complex number as input and returns a complex number as output, but with the input and output values swapped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.atan(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` is a complex
