  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `Delta` object to be constructed with a null insert value, rather than the expected insert value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `Delta` object to be constructed with a null retain value, rather than the expected retain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `Delta` object to be constructed with a null attributes value, rather than the expected attributes value.

DONE.
