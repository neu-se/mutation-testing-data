  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this replacement checks if it's a string. If `op.retain` is a string, the original code would return 1, while this replacement would return the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this replacement checks if it's equal to 0. If `op.retain` is 0, the original code would return 1, while this replacement would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it's not null. If `
