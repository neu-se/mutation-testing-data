  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method would be applied to the `laterQueue` array, which is not the intended behavior. The `pop` method removes the last element from an array and returns it, which would lead to unexpected results in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element from an array and returns it, which would lead to unexpected results in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array, which would lead to unexpected results in this context.

DONE.
