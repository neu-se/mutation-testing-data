  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert degrees to radians, while the new code fragment multiplies the difference in longitude by `Math.PI / 180`, which is not a correct way to convert degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert degrees to radians, while the new code fragment multiplies the difference in longitude by `180 / Math.PI`, which is not a correct way to convert degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI
