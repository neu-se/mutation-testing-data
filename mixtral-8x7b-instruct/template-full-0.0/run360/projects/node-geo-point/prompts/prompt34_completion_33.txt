 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division by zero error when `point2Rad` is 90 or -90, while the original code fragment (`cos(point2Rad)`) would not result in such an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the exponential function instead of the cosine function, leading to different results in the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point1Rad + point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the sum of `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` instead of the product of the cosine of `point2Rad` and the sine of `point1Rad`, leading to incorrect distance calculations.
