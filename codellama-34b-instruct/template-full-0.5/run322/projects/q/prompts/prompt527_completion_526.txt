  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, args, op
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument of the `args` array to the `dispatch` function, which could cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the second argument of the `args` array to the `dispatch` function, which could cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
