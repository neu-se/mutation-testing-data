Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the first occurrence of 'a' in the word to 'man', which would not correctly pluralize words like "woman" to "women".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'@'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first occurrence of 'a' with '@', resulting in nonsensical plural forms like "wom@n" instead of the correct "women".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first occurrence of 'a' with '1', leading to incorrect pluralization such as "wom1n" instead of "women".

DONE.
