  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).npost` returns a function, while `Q(object).npost.bind(null)` returns a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).npost` returns a function, while `Q(object).npost.call(null)` calls the original function immediately with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, and returns the result of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).npost` returns a function, while `Q(object).npost.apply(null)` calls
