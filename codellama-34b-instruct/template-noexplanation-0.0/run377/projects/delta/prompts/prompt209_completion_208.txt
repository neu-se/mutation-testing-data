  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length());
```
This code fragment will cause the `chop` method to be called with the length of the `delta` object as an argument, which will result in the `chop` method being called with a non-zero argument, which will cause the `chop` method to return a new `Delta` object with the last operation removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 1);
```
This code fragment will cause the `chop` method to be called with the length of the `delta` object minus one as an argument, which will result in the `chop` method being called with a non-zero argument, which will cause the `chop` method to return a new `Delta` object with the last operation removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(delta.length() - 2);
```
This code fragment will
