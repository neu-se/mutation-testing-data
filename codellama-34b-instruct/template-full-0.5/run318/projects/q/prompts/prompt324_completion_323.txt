  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually. In this case, it would call the `descriptor[op]` function with `promise` as the `this` value and `args` as the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise, args)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. In this case, it would create a new function that calls `descriptor[op]` with `promise` as the `this` value and `args` as the arguments, and then call the new function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
