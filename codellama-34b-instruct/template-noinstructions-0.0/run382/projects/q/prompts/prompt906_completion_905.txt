  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`. This means that if the `callback` argument is not `undefined`, the replacement code would enter the `if` block, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `null`. This means that if the `callback` argument is not `null`, the replacement code would enter the `if` block, while the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not the string `"undefined"`. This means that if the
