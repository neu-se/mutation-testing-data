Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is opened in write mode instead of read mode, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the file does not exist or if the intention is to read from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is opened in append mode instead of read mode, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the intention is to read from the file or overwrite its contents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename, 'r+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file is opened in read and write mode instead of just read mode, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the intention is to only read from the file, and could potentially allow writing to the file when it's not intended.

DONE.
