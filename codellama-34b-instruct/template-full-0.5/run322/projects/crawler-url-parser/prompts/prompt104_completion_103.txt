  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property, which is not the same as checking if the `text` variable is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text is included in the `tmpUrl.text` property, but would not check if the `text` variable is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.includes(tmpUrl.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `tmpUrl.text` property is included in the `text` variable, which is not the same as checking if the `text` variable is truthy.

DONE.
