  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would now be operating on the base URL instead of the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would now be operating on the embedded base URL instead of the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would now be operating on `null` instead of the current URL.

DONE.
