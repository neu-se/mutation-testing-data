Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `then` to `catch`, which means that it will only handle rejections instead of both fulfillment and progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(void 0, progressed, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly places the `progressed` callback in the position meant for the rejection handler, which would cause progress notifications to be ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it only provides the `progressed` callback without handling fulfillment or rejection, which means that the promise's resolution will not be properly managed.

DONE.
