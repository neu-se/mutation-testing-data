  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "internal")
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument "internal" would always be passed to the gettype function, regardless of the actual type of the link and page URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "external")
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument "external" would always be passed to the gettype function, regardless of the actual type of the link and page URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, "uplevel")
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument "uplevel" would always be passed to the gettype function, regardless of the actual type of the link and page URLs.

DONE.
