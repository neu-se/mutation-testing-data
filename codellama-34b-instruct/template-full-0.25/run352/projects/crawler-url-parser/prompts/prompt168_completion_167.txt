  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path includes the page URL path, which is the opposite of what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path starts with the page URL path, which is a different condition than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path ends with the page URL path, which is a different condition than the original code.

DONE.
