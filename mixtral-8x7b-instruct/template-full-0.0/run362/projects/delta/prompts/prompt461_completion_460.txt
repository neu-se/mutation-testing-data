 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[next].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, while `concat` returns a new array containing the joined arrays. In this case, the `rest` method should return an array, so using `slice` instead of `concat` would change the behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[next].push
