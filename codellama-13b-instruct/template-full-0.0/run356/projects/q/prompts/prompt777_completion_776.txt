  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `Promise` prototype, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
