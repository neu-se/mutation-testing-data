This change will cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return an array of key-value pairs from the `timezones` object, rather than an object with the keys. This will likely cause the `buildCountry` function to fail, as it relies on the keys of the `timezones` object to determine the country names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This change will cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return an array of the
