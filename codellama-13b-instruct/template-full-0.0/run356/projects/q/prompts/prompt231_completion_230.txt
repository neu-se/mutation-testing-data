  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.push(operands[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the progress listener to the `progressListeners` array, whereas the original code fragment does not add anything to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.unshift(operands[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the progress listener to the beginning of the `progressListeners` array, whereas the original code fragment adds it to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.splice(0, 0, operands[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the progress listener to the beginning of the `progressListeners` array, whereas the original code fragment adds it to the end of the array.

DONE.
