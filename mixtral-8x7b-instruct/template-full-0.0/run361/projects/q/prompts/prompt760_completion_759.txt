 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].map.bind(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native `Array.prototype.map` instead of the `Q.array_map` function, which may not handle promises correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.all(promises.map(function(promise) { return Q(promise); }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps every promise in a new promise using `Q`, which may change the settling behavior of the promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice(0).map(function(promise) { return Q(promise); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array and wraps every promise in a new promise using `Q`, which may change the settling behavior of the promises and also may not handle the original array correctly if
