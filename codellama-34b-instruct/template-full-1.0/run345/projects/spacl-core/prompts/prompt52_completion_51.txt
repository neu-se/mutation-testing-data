  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.pop` would remove the last element from the `parts` array, while `parts.push` would add a new element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `part.slice(1)` onto the `props` array, rather than the value of `part`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}` onto the `parts` array, rather than the value of `part`.

DONE.
