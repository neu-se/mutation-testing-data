Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync.bind(null, srcFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.existsSync.bind(null, srcFile)` will always check for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the destination file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement will always return `false`, indicating that the destination file does not exist, even if it does, which could lead to overwriting existing files without warning when `clobber` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync.bind(null, destFile, 'r')
```
However, `fs.existsSync` does not take a mode as its second argument. A more suitable replacement could be:
```javascript
fs.accessSync.bind(null, destFile, fs.constants.F_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.accessSync` checks the accessibility of the file, not just its existence, which could lead to different outcomes based on the file's permissions rather than just its existence
