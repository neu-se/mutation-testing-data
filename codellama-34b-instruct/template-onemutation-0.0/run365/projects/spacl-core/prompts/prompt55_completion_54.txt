  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.replace(/^/, '\\')`
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `.replace(/^/, '\\')` would add an extra backslash to the beginning of the string, which would cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
