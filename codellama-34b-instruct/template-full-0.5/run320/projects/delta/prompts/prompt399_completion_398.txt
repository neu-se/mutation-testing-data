  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisData || !otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisData` or `otherData` is falsy, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if the types of `thisData` and `otherData` are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData === otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisData` and `otherData` are the same object, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if the types of `thisData` and `otherData` are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.constructor === otherData.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisData` and `otherData` are instances of the same class, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, even if the types of `thisData` and `otherData` are different.

DONE.
