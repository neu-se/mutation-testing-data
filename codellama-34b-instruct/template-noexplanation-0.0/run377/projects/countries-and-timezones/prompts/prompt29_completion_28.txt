  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This code fragment will cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a string that is always less than 60 minutes, regardless of the value of the `offset` parameter. This will result in incorrect offset values being returned for some time zones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This code fragment will cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a string that is always greater than 60 minutes, regardless of the value of the `offset` parameter. This will result in incorrect offset values being returned for some time zones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60 + 1
```
This code fragment will cause the `getOffsetStr` function to return a string that is always one hour greater than the actual offset value. This will result in incorrect offset values being returned for some time zones.

DONE.
