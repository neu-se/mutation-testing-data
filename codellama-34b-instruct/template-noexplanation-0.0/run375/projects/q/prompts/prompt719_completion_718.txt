  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This change will cause the `keys` method to return the values of the object instead of the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", []
```
This change will cause the `keys` method to return the length of the object instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString", []
```
This change will cause the `keys` method to return the string representation of the object instead of the keys.

DONE.
