 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object['keys']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the 'keys' property of the Object constructor as a regular property instead of using the dynamic property access provided by the square brackets. This could potentially lead to issues if the 'keys' property is ever changed or removed from the Object constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of all own property keys on the object, including non-enumerable properties, whereas `Object.keys` returns only the enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
JSON.parse('{"keys":1}').keys
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `JSON.parse` method to create an object with a 'keys' property, and then accesses that property. This is different from the original code, which accesses the 'keys' method
