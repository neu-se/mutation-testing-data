  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.source.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.source` is not defined, so it would return `undefined`, whereas the original code would return the stack trace of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` would create a copy of the stack trace array, whereas the original code would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` would reverse the order of the stack trace array, whereas the original code would return the original array.

DONE.
