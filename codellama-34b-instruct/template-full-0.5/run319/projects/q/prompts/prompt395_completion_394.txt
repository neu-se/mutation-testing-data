  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method immediately, rather than returning a function that would call the `then` method later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that would always return the same value, regardless of the input to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that would always return the same value, regardless of the input to the `then` method.

DONE.
