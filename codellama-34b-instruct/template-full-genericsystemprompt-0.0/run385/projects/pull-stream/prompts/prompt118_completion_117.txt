  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `acc` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `acc` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `sink` function with the `source` argument, while this new code fragment calls the `sink` function with no arguments.

DONE.
