  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to iterate over more or fewer elements than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 1, but the increment would be assigned back to `i` instead of being done in place. This would cause the loop to iterate over the same elements as the original code, but with an extra assignment operation on each iteration.

DONE.
