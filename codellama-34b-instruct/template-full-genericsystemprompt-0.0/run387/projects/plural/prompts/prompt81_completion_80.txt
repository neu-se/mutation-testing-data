  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a tuple of two strings, while the new code fragment is a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "geese" as the plural form of "goose", while the new code fragment has the word "gooses" as the plural form of "goose".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose', 'gese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has the word "geese" as the plural form of "goose", while the new code fragment has the word "gese" as the plural form of "goose".

DONE.
