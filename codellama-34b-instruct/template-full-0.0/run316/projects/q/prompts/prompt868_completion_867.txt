  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to be skipped and the `catch` method to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved, which would cause the `then` method to be called with a notification value instead of a resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a node-style callback instead of a promise, which would cause the `then` method to be called with a callback function instead of a resolved value.

DONE.
