  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be doubled, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
