 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` keyword is used to remove a property from an object, so `this.emit` would be undefined and any further attempts to call it as a function would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `emit` function with an empty function, so any calls to `this.emit` would not have any effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `emit` property to null, so any calls to `this.emit` would result in a "TypeError: this.emit is not a function" error.

DONE.
