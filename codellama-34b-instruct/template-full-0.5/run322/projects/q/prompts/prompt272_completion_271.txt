  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.bind(newPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, which would cause the `progressListener` to be called with a different context than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.apply(newPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided as an array, which would cause the `progressListener` to be called with a different context and arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.call(newPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually, which would cause the `progressListener` to be called with a different context and arguments than expected.

DONE.
