  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "logHypot(b, a)"
This would result in different behavior because "logHypot(a, b)" and "logHypot(b, a)" are different mathematical expressions returning different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "Math.log(a+b)"
This would result in different behavior because "Math.log(a)" and "Math.log(a+b)" are different mathematical expressions returning different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "Math.log(b)"
This would result in different behavior because "Math.log(a)" and "Math.log(b)" are different mathematical expressions returning different results.

DONE.
