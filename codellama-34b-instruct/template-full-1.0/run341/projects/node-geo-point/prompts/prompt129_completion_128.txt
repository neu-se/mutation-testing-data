  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.toTile(this, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would be called with a different zoom level, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.fromLngLatArray([this.longitude, this.latitude], zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromLngLatArray` method would be called with a different array of longitude and latitude values, which could result in a different `GeoPoint` being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.calculateDestination(distance / 2, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would be called with a different distance and bearing, which could result in a different destination point being returned.

DONE.
