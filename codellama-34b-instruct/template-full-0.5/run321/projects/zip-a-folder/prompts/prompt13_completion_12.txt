  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `src` string with the number `1`, resulting in a different file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of the `src` string starting from the second character, which could change the file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return the `src` string in uppercase, which could change the file path.

DONE.
