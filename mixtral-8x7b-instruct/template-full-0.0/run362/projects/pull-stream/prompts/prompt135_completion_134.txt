 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would immediately exit with a non-zero status code, rather than calling the callback function `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be printed to the console, rather than being passed to the callback function `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => cb(err), 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be passed to the callback function `cb` after a delay of 1 second, rather than being passed to it immediately.

DONE.
