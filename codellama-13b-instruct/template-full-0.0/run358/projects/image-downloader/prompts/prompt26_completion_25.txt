  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` module is being used to make a GET request instead of the `request` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` module is being used to make a POST request instead of the `request` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.put
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` module is being used to make a PUT request instead of the `request` function.

DONE.
