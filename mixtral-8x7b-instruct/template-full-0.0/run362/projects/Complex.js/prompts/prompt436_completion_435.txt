 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10 * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 10, instead of using the provided `places` argument or defaulting to 0. This could lead to unexpected results in the `floor`, `ceil`, and `round` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to 10 instead of 0 when the `places` argument is not provided. This could lead to unexpected results in the `floor`, `ceil`, and `round` methods, as the precision would be higher than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
places || this['re'].toString().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it defaults to the length of the real part of the complex number's string representation instead of 0 when the `places` argument is not
