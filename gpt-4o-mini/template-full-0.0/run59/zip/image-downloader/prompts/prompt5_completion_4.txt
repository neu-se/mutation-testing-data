Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(new Error('The options.dest is required'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with an error instead of rejecting it, meaning that the calling code would not handle the error as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('The options.dest is required');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error immediately, which would not return a promise at all, potentially causing unhandled exceptions in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('The options.dest is required');
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a string instead of an Error object, which may lead to different error handling behavior in the calling code that expects an Error instance.

DONE.
