  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty(error, "stack", {value: stack, configurable: false});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `configurable` property is set to `false`, which means that the property cannot be deleted or changed. In the original code, the `configurable` property is set to `true`, which means that the property can be deleted or changed.

DONE.
