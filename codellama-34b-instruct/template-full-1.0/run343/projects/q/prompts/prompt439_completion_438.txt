  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Null
```
This would result in different behavior because "Null" is not equal to "promise" and would therefore fail the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "promise" is not the same object as "promise" and would therefore fail the check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because NaN is never equal to itself and would therefore fail the check.

DONE.
