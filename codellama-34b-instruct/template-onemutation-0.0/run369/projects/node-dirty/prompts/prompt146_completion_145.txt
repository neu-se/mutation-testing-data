  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `Dirty` object to emit an `'error'` event instead of a `'drain'` event, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` object.

DONE.
