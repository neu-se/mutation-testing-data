Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the object is fulfilled when it is actually in a pending state, leading to false positives in the fulfillment check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the object is fulfilled when it is actually in a rejected state, causing the function to return true for rejected promises instead of false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled" === inspected.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the string "fulfilled" to the state directly, which could lead to unexpected results if the state is not exactly "fulfilled", potentially causing the function to return incorrect results based on type coercion.

DONE.
