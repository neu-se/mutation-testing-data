  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(offset < index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code ensures that the offset is always less than the index, whereas the replacement code only checks that the offset is less than the index if the priority is not set to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(offset < index && priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code ensures that the offset is always less than or equal to the index if the priority is set to true, whereas the replacement code only checks that the offset is less than the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(offset < index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks that the offset is less than or equal to the index, whereas the replacement code only checks that the offset is less than the index.

DONE.
