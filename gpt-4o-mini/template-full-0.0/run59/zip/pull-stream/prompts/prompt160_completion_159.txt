Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `null` may lead to different handling in the callback, as `undefined` is not strictly equal to `null`, which could affect how the receiving function interprets the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `false` instead of `null` changes the first argument of the callback, which may lead to different logic being executed in the callback function, potentially causing it to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because `_undefined` is an undeclared variable, which would result in a ReferenceError when the code is executed, thus altering the flow of the program and potentially causing it to crash.

DONE.
