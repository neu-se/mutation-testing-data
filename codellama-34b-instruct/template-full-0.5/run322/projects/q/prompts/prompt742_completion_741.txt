  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` if it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would be called for the `promise` if it is fulfilled or rejected, but the callback function would do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, function (progress) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would be called for the `promise` if it is fulfilled or rejected, but the callback function would not have any effect on the behavior of the `promise`.

DONE.
