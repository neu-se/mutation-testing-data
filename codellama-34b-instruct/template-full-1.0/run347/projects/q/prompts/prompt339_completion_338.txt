  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.value` is not a function and will not execute `inspected.value.call(promise)` when `inspected.value` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected[op]
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected[op]` is not a function and will not execute `inspected[op].apply(promise, args)` when `inspected[op]` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.rejected` is not a function and will not execute `inspected.rejected(exception)` when `inspected.rejected` is called.

DONE.
