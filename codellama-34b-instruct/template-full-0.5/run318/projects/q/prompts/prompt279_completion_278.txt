  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now 2, which would return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the third element instead of the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the second element, but it would not include the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `array_slice` is now 2, which would return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the second element and ending at the third element.

DONE.
