  Option 1: The buggy code fragment could be replaced with:
```
    b++)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `b` before multiplying it and `a`, whereas the original code fragment multiplies `a` and `b` and then adds `b` to the result.

Option 2: The buggy code fragment could be replaced with:
```
    b * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `b` and `c` instead of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code fragment multiplies `b` and `a`.

Option 3: The buggy code fragment could be replaced with:
```
    c * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `c` and `b` instead of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code fragment multiplies `b` and `a`.
