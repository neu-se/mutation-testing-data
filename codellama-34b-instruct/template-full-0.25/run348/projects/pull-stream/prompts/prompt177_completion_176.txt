  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `abortCb` function to be called when `abort` is `false`, rather than when it is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `abort` or `onAbort` is truthy, and if so, calls the `abortCb` function with the first truthy value. This could cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different value than the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `abort` and `onAbort` are truthy, and if so, calls the `abort
