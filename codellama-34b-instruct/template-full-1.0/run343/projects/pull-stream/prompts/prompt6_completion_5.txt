  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in throughs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would iterate over the properties of the `throughs` object rather than the `exports` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sinks) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would iterate over the properties of the `sinks` object rather than the `throughs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for(var k in sources) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the for loop would iterate over the properties of the `sources` object rather than the `throughs` object.

DONE.
