Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push an operation with a length of 0, effectively ignoring the actual length of the operation being processed, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push an operation with a length of 1, regardless of the actual length of the operation, potentially causing data loss or incorrect results in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an operation with a length that is one greater than the retain value of the other operation, which could lead to an incorrect representation of the composed operations and unintended modifications to the delta.

DONE.
