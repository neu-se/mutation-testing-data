  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.method.apply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method on the `Function` prototype, and `object.method` is a custom method, so `apply` may not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.method.call(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method on the `Function` prototype, and `object.method` is a custom method, so `call` may not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.method(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.method` is a custom method, and `nodeArgs` is an array, so the method may not handle the input correctly.

DONE.
