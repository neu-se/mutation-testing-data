  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value).then(callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used instead of `when`, which would cause the callback and errback functions to be called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value).catch(errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used instead of `when`, which would cause the errback function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value).finally(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used instead of `when`, which would cause the callback function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
