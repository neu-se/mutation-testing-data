  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the "!==" operator, which checks for inequality, while this new code fragment uses the "===" operator, which checks for equality. This small change could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherVariable !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment referred to a variable named "ReturnValue," while this new code fragment refers to a different variable named "otherVariable." This small change could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== typeof otherVariable
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the "!==" operator, which checks for inequality of types, while this new code fragment uses the "===" operator, which checks for equality of types. This small change could potentially cause the code to behave differently in
