  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `c`, and could potentially cause the code to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `c`, and could potentially cause the code to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a different variable than `c`, and could potentially cause the code to produce a different result.

DONE.
