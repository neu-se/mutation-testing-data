  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `dispatch` method with the `set` operation, which would set the property `key` to `value` on the object, rather than returning a promise for the property value.
