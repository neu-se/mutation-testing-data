  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `callback` function with the `object` as an argument, while the buggy code fragment would throw an error instead.
