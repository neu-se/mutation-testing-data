  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the argument at index 0 instead of index 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first two arguments instead of only the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` instead of the first argument.

DONE.
