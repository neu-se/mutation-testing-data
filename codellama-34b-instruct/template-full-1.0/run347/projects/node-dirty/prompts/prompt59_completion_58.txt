  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the dirty DB file streams immediately, rather than waiting for the writes to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'close' event immediately, rather than waiting for the writes to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `_inFlightWrites` to 0 immediately, rather than waiting for the writes to complete.

DONE.
