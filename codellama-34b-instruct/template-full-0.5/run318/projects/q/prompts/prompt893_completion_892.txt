  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid object reference in JavaScript, but it does not have a `fapply` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object reference in JavaScript, so the code would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `nfapply` method to be called with a rejected promise, rather than a resolved promise with the value `callback`.

DONE.
