  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.values` is a different property than `values`, and it may not be a function that can be called with the same arguments as `values`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.value` is a different property than `values`, and it may not be a function that can be called with the same arguments as `values`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(values)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.map(values)` is a different function than `values`, and it may not produce the same output as `values` when called with the same arguments.

DONE.
