  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct the `baseUrl` object, which is then used to parse the `currentUrl` string. By replacing `http://` with `https://`, we are effectively changing the protocol of the URL, which could potentially cause the parsing to fail or return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to construct the `baseUrl` object, which is then used to parse the `currentUrl` string. By removing the `www.` subdomain from the URL, we are potentially changing the domain of the URL, which could cause the parsing to fail or return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("stackoverflow.com", "example.com")
```
