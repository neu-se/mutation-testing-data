  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the object, whereas the original code fragment only creates a shallow copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas the original code fragment only creates a shallow copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(newOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` create a deep copy of the object, whereas the original code fragment only creates a shallow copy.

DONE.
