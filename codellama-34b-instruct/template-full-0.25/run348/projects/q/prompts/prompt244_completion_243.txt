  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.bind(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to `resolvedPromise`, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `inspect` method with a `this` context of `null`, which would cause the method to be called on a different object than the one it was originally called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `inspect` method with a `this` context of `undefined`, which would cause the method to be called on a different object than the one
