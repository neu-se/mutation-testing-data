  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse a null value, while the original code would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse an undefined value, while the original code would not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse()` method would throw an error when trying to parse an empty object, while the original code would not throw an error.

DONE.
