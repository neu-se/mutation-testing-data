 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_fulfilled(value) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always resolve to a value greater than the original resolved value, which could cause issues if the consumer of the promise expects the resolved value to be unmodified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would resolve to a random value, which is not the same as the original resolved value. This could cause issues if the consumer of the promise relies on the resolved value being the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be a new promise that wraps the original resolved value, rather than the original resolved value itself. This could cause issues if the consumer of the promise expects to work directly with the resolved value, rather than a promise that resolves to the value.
