  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the error object as an argument, whereas the original code fragment would not call the function at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment would call the function with the error object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be called at all, whereas the original code fragment would call the function with the error object as an argument.

DONE.
