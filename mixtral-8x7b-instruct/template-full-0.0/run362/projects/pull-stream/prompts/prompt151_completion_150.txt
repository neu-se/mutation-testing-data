 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't save and set `value` to `null` after using it, potentially causing the same `value` to be returned in subsequent calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls `abortCb` with `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` as arguments, instead of returning it as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abortCb(value, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `value` as the first argument to `abortCb`, instead of `cb`.

DONE.
