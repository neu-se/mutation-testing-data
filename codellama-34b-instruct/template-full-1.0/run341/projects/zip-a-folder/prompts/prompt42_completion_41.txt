  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method would cause the `zipArchiver` to write to the `output` stream, rather than the `glob` method which determines which files to include in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.archive(output, { glob: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archive` method would include all files in the archive, rather than the `glob` method which allows for glob pattern matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would include all files in the directory, rather than the `glob` method which allows for glob pattern matching.

DONE.
