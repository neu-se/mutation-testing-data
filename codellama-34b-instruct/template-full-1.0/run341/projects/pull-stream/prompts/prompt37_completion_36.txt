  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the array, rather than the third, which was the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the array, rather than the third, which was the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the array, rather than the third, which was the original code fragment.

DONE.
