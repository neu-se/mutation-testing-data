  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with the index `1` instead of the index `0`, which would insert the new element at a different position in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with the index `-1` instead of the index `0`, which would insert the new element at the end of the array instead of at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with the index `this.ops.length` instead of the index `0`, which would insert the new element at the end of the array instead of at the beginning.

DONE.
