  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the result of the ternary operator, while this code fragment is adding 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the result of the ternary operator, while this code fragment is adding 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '3'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the result of the ternary operator, while this code fragment is adding 3.

DONE.
