  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`, which would cause the `become` function to be called even if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false` or `hasStacks` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `hasStacks`, which would cause the `become` function to be called only if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true` and `hasStacks` is `false`.
