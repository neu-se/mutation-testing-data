  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used in the original code fragment is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable used in the original code fragment is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression used in the original code fragment is different.

DONE.
