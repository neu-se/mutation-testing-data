 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.slice` method instead of the `array_slice` function, which might have different behavior or not be defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `array_slice` function with `null`, causing a `TypeError` when the `fcall` method is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
  throw new Error('Deliberate error in array_slice');
}
