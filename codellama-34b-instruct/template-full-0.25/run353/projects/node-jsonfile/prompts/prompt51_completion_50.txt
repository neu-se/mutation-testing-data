  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` function with the `replacer` and `spaces` arguments, which are not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` function with a `null` replacer function, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` function with a `spaces` argument of 0, which would result in a different output than the original code.

DONE.
