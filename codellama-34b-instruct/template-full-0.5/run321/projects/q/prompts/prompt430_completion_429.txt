  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(true).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(false).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of the state of the promise.

DONE.
