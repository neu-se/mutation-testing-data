  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the code would not consider `null` or `undefined` values as equal. In the original code, `a[key] === undefined` checks for both `null` and `undefined` values, so this replacement would cause the code to behave differently in those cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the code would only consider `null` values as equal.
