  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a function that returns a new promise, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that is already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise that is already resolved, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that is not yet resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that returns a new promise, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that is already resolved.

DONE.
