  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to use a different delimiter, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to use a different delimiter, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `split()` method to use a different delimiter, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
