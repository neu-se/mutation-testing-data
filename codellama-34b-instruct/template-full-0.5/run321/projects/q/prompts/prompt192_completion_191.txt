  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first line of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second line of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("\n").slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last line of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

DONE.
