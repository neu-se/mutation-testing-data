Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `aborted` would cause the callback to be invoked with `null`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the aborted state in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `aborted` would indicate that the operation was successful, which contradicts the intended behavior of signaling that the operation was aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `end` instead of `aborted` would pass the `end` value to the callback, which may not represent an error or aborted state, leading to confusion in the handling of the data flow.

DONE.
