  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is the angle component of the complex number, while `a['abs']` is the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(a['arg'])` is the absolute value of the angle component, while `a['abs']` is the absolute value of the real and imaginary components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 3.14
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg'] + 3.14` is the angle component plus pi, while `a['abs']` is the absolute value of the real and imaginary components.

DONE.
