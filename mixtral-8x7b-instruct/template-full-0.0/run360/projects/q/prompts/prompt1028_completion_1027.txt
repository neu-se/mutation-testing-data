 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeback` is a function argument, while `true` is a boolean literal. This change would cause the `nodeback` function to not be called in the success case, breaking the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeback` is a function argument, while `null` is an object. This change would cause a TypeError, as the `nodeback` function is expected to be called, but instead, a `null` value is being passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `nodeback` is a specific function provided as an argument, while `function () {}` creates a new, empty function. This change would cause the provided function to not be called in the success case, breaking the
