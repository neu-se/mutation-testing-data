  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the promise to be rejected with the thrown error, whereas `reject` will explicitly reject the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given value, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.

DONE.
