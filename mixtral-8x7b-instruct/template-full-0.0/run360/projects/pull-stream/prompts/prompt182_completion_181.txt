 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the correct arguments to `abortCb`, causing unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to `abortCb`, causing unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, true, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of arguments in `abortCb`, causing unexpected behavior in the `abort` scenario.

These changes would not be caught by the current test suite, providing a starting point for improving the test suite's effectiveness in catching potential issues.

DONE.
