 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a function as an argument, and `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a function as an argument, and an integer would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
