  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to `Math.cosh` is flipped, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Math.exp` computes the exponential function, which has a different range and values than the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.sinh()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex.sinh` method computes the hyperbolic sine of the complex number, which is different from the `Math.sinh` function used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
