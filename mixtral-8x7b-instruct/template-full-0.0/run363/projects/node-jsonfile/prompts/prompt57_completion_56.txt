 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash before the 'n' would be treated as a literal backslash, not an escape character. The regular expression would then look for a single 'n' character instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[\n]` would match either a newline character or a literal 'n' character. This would cause the replace function to replace any occurrence of 'n' with the EOL, not just newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\r\n|\n)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match both newline characters (`\n`) and carriage return + newline characters (`\r\n`). This could cause issues if the input string uses a different newline convention than the one expected
