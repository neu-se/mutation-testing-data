  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "*"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, whereas the original code only included files in the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "**"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, as well as any files in subdirectories of those subdirectories, whereas the original code only included files in the current directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + "?"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include only files in the current directory that match the given pattern, whereas the original code included all files in the current directory.

DONE.
