  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the `diff()` method to consider the next operation in the `other` Delta, which could lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `diff()` method to consider the previous operation in the `other` Delta, which could lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding the length of the current operation in the `other
