  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisIter.peek() === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation in the iteration is an object, which is not equivalent to checking if it is a deletion operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation in the iteration is a retain operation, which is not equivalent to checking if it is a deletion operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekAction() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current operation in the iteration has a retain action, which is not equivalent to checking if it is a deletion operation.

DONE.
