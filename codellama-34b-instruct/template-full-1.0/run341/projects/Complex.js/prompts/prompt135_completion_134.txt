  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() || !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return Infinity when one or both of the operands are not Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && z['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return Finite when both operands are Finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']() && !z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return NaN when one or both of the operands are NaN.

DONE.
