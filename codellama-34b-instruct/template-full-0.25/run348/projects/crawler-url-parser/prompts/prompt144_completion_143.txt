  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a global search and replace all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a case-insensitive search, so the pattern would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex engine to perform a multi-line search, so the pattern would match the end of each line in the input string, rather than just
