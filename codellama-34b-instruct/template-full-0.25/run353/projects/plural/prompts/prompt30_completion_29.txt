  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches the string "thesis" twice, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches the string "crisis" twice, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|somethingelse/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches a different string, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
