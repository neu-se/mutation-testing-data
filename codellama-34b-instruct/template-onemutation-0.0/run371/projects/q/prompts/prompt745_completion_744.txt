  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is fulfilled, whereas `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected. Using `onFulfilled` instead of `onRejected` would cause the promise to be fulfilled even if the promise is rejected, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
