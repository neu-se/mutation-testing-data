  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the strict equality operator `===` which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code uses the abstract equality operator `==` which only checks for value equality. This means that the new code would return `true` for `b` being `0` or any other falsy value, while the original code would only return `true` for `b` being `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the strict equality operator `===` which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code uses the abstract equality operator `!=` which only checks for value inequality. This means that the new code would return `true` for `b` being any value other than `0`, while the original code would only return `true` for `b` being `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
