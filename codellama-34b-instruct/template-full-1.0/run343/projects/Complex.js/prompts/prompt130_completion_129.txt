  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `div` method will return `Complex['INFINITY']` even if only one of the operands is infinite, instead of only when both operands are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `div` method will return `Complex['INFINITY']` only when the dividend is infinite and the divisor is not, instead of only when both operands are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() || !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `div` method will return `Complex['INFINITY']` only when neither operand is infinite, instead of only when both operands are infinite
