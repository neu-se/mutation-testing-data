  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the larger of two numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smaller.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.push(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation onto the `a` array, whereas the original code fragment pushed the next operation onto the `retDelta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(otherIter.next()) + '\n' * retDelta.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would stringify the next operation and concatenate it with a newline character for each operation in `retDelta`, whereas the original code fragment only pushed the stringified operation onto the `retDelta` array.

DONE.
