  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let variable = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because `variable` would be assigned the value of `otherIter.peek()`, which is the next Op in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the current length of the Op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let variable = thisIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because `variable` would be assigned the length of the current Op in the `thisIter` iterator, rather than the length of the Op in the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let variable = otherIter.peek().length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `variable` would be assigned the length of the current Op in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the length of the Op in the `thisIter` iterator.

DONE.
