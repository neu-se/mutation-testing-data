  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function that is called with the `abort` argument, while `null` is a constant that does not have a `abort` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function that is called with the `abort` argument, while `undefined` is a constant that does not have a `abort` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function that is called with the `abort` argument, while `0` is a constant that does not have a `abort` method.

DONE.
