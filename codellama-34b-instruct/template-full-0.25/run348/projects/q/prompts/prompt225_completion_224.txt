  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, whereas `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)` would return a shallow copy of the `
