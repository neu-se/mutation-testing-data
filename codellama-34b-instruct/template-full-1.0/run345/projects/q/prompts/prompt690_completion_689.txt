  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function is called with a different set of arguments, which would change the resulting slice of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` pointer is passed as the first argument to `array_slice`, which would change the resulting slice of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function is called with a different set of arguments, which would change the resulting slice of the array.

DONE.
