 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'id'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `buildCountry` from the `id` variable to a string literal. This could cause issues if the `buildCountry` function expects a dynamic value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `buildCountry` from the `id` variable to a hardcoded number. This could cause issues if the `buildCountry` function expects a string or a different numeric value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `buildCountry` from the `id` variable to a random number. This could cause issues if the `buildCountry` function expects a specific, consistent value.

DONE.
