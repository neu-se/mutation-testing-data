  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('/').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` and `join` methods are being called on a non-string value, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.slice(0, -10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is being called on a non-string value, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\W/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern `\W` does not match any characters that would be found in a valid URL string.

DONE.
