  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value 42, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.throw(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
