  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is the opposite of `isEqual`, and would cause the `diff()` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isLessThan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isLessThan` would cause the `diff()` function to return a different result if the length of the two strings being compared is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGreaterThan
```
This would result in different behavior because `isGreaterThan` would cause the `diff()` function to return a different result if the length of the two strings being compared is different.

DONE.
