  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.map(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
