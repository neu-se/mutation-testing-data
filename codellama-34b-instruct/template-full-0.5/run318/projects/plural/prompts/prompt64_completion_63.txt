  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacteria', which is the correct plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacterium', which is the singular form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'bacteria', which is the correct plural form of the word.

DONE.
