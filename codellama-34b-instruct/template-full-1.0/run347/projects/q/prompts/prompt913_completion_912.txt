  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a promise library, and using it as a duplicate parameter in the `nfapply` function would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a promise, and using it as a duplicate parameter in the `nfapply` function would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would reverse the order of the arguments passed to the `nfapply` function, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
