  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π
```
This would result in different behavior because π (Pi) is a mathematical 
constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its 
diameter, and it is approximately equal to 3.14159. In the context of the 
code, using π instead of φ2 (the latitude) would cause the destination point
to be calculated using a different latitude value, which would result in a 
different location on the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because using λ1 (the longitude)
instead of φ2 (the latitude) would cause the destination point to be 
calculated using a different latitude value, which would result in a 
different location on the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because using φ1 (the starting 
point'
