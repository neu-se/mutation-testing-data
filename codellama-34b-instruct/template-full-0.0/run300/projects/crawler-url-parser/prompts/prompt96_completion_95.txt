  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is modified, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is modified, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is modified, which could affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
