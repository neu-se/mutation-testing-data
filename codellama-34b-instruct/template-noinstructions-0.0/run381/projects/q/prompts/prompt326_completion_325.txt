  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"when"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the string "when" as the first argument, which would not be a valid operation name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"then"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the string "then" as the first argument, which would not be a valid operation name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"catch"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with the string "catch" as the first argument, which would not be a valid operation name.

DONE.
