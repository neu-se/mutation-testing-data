  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is not being set to `true` in the original code, which means that the `sink.abort` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is being set to `false` in the original code, which means that the `sink.abort` function will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is being set to `null` in the original code, which means that the `sink.abort` function will not be called.

DONE.
