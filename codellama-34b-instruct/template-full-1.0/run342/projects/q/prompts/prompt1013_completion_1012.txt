  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = ['foo', 'bar']
```
This would result in different behavior because `['foo', 'bar']` is a literal array with two elements, rather than a variable that contains the node args.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(['foo', 'bar'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array that is the result of merging two or more existing arrays, rather than adding an element to an existing array.

DONE.
