  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is a negation of the original `prop` value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, and the `read` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` would add 1 to the original `prop` value, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, and the `read` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop * 2` would multiply the original `prop` value by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, and the `read` function would not be called.

DONE.
