  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array with the elements of the original array repeated, whereas the original code would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would return a new array with the elements of the original array in reverse order, whereas the original code would return the original array.

DONE.
