  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Dummy error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, instead of being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value + 1; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value.toUpperCase(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code, specifically a transformation of the original value to uppercase.

DONE.
