  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called with a different key, potentially retrieving a different property or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called with a different key, potentially retrieving a different property or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would be called with a different key, potentially retrieving a different property or value.

DONE.
