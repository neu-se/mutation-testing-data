  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `NaN` is not. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with the parameter `null`, which is a valid value. However, if `NaN` is passed to the function instead, the outcome will be different.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not the same as `null`. The function call will return a different string than if `null` was passed. This can break any code that relies on the idea that passing `null` to this function will return a certain string value.  

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var PLACEHOLDER = null;
```
This is the exact opposite of the original code and is not useful
