  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand. In this case, the first operand `href` is a string, and the second operand `baseUrlStr` is also a string. When concatenated, the two strings are combined into a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand. In this case, the first operand `href` is a string, and the second operand `baseUrlStr` is also a string. When used with the logical OR operator `||`, the two strings are compared, and the result is a boolean value indicating whether either string is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr + '?'
```
