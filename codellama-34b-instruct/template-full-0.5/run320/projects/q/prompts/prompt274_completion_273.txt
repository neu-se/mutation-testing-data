  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error instanceof Error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a certain class, while the `typeof` operator checks the type of a value. In this case, the `typeof` operator would return "object" for an Error object, while the `instanceof` operator would return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.name === "Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of an Error object contains the name of the error, which is not necessarily the same as the type of the error. For example, an error with the name "TypeError" would return "TypeError" for the `name` property, while the `typeof` operator would return "object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.constructor === Error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an Error object contains a reference
