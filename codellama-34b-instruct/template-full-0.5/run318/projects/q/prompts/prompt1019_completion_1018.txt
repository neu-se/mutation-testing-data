  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` would be bound to the current object, whereas the original code fragment would call `dispatch` on the `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` would be called with `null` as the `this` object, whereas the original code fragment would call `dispatch` on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` would be called with `undefined` as the `this` object, whereas the original code fragment would call `dispatch` on the `this` object.

DONE.
