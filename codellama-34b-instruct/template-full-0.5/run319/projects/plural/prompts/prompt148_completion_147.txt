  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, w.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two characters of the word, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(1, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the word, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
