Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the character being represented from a null character (0) to a start of heading character (1), which may affect how diffs are processed or displayed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an invalid character code, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when attempting to create a string from it, potentially breaking the functionality that relies on a valid null character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(255)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the null character to a character with the maximum value for a byte (255), which may not be handled correctly in the diffing process, leading to incorrect comparisons or outputs.

DONE.
