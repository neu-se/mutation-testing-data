  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would not be able to properly cancel the timeout and the promise would resolve, if it was resolved before the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timeoutId"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would not be able to properly cancel the timeout and the promise would resolve or reject according to the result of the `Q()` promise, if it was resolved before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would not be able to properly cancel the timeout and the promise would resolve, if it was resolved before the timeout, with a result of `0`.

DONE.
