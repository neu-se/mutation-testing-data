  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` would not match the string `w`, so the replacement would not occur.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/e/, 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e/` would match the string `w`, so the replacement would occur, but the resulting string would be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/a/, 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` would match the string `w`, so the replacement would occur, but the resulting string would be different from the original.

DONE.
