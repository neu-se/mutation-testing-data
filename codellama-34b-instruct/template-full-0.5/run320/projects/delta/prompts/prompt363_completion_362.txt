  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the iterator has a next element, while `hasNext` is a property that returns the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` advances the iterator to the next element and returns that element, while `hasNext` only returns the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, while `hasNext` returns the next element without returning it.

DONE.
