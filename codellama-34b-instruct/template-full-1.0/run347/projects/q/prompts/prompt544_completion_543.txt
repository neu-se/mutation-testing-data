  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `StopIteration` object, while this replacement checks for its nullity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `StopIteration` object, while this replacement checks for its nullity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `StopIteration` object, while this replacement checks for its undefinedness.

DONE.
