  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` negates the error value, which could cause the program to pass an error that would have been caught in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err = new Error('Some error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `err = new Error('Some error')` assigns a new error object to the `err` variable, which could cause the program to behave differently when encountering an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.message` retrieves the error message from the error object, which could cause the program to behave differently when encountering an error.

DONE.
