  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, regardless of the value of the `minus` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add 0 to the imaginary part of the complex number, regardless of the value of the `minus` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always add the variable `a` to the imaginary part of the complex number, regardless of the value of the `minus` variable.

DONE.
