  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` arrays would be initialized with the `id` of the current country, rather than being empty as in the original code. This could cause issues if the `id` is not a valid country code, or if the `id` is not the same as the `country` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` arrays would be initialized with empty arrays, rather than being initialized with the `id` of the current country as in the original code. This could cause issues if the `id` is not a valid country code, or if the `id` is not the same as the `country` variable.
