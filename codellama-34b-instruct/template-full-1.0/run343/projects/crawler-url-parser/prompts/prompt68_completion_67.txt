  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because `sourceUrl` is a different variable than `baseUrl`, and it may contain a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it will not have the properties or methods that the `baseUrl` object is expected to have.

DONE.
