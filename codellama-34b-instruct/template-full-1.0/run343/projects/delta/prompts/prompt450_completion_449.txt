  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && typeof op.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional && operator would cause the expression to evaluate to false if either the retain or delete property is not a number, which could cause the function to return different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional && operator would cause the expression to evaluate to true only if the retain property is an object and not null, which could cause the function to return different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' || op.retain === 'Infinity'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional || operator would cause the expression to evaluate to true if the retain property is either a number or the Infinity constant, which could cause the function to return different results.
