  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` function would return a resolved promise, whereas the original code fragment `Q.reject` would return a rejected promise. This could cause the `get` method to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function would create a new deferred object, whereas the original code fragment `Q.reject` would return a rejected promise. This could cause the `get` method to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q.reject())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function would return a promise that is resolved with the value
