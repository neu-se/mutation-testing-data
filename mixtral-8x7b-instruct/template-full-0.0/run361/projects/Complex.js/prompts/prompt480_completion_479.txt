 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement always evaluates to `true`, while the original expression depends on the properties of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement checks if the number is finite, while the original expression checks if the number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) > Complex['EPSILON'] || Math.abs(this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement checks if either the real or imaginary part of the number is greater than the epsilon value, while the original expression checks if the absolute value of both parts is greater than the epsilon value.

DONE.
