  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function returns `true` if the input is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment checks for the opposite condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `src` is a glob pattern, while the new code fragment checks if `src` has multiple parts separated by commas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src) && src.split(',').length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `src` is a glob pattern, while the new code fragment checks if `src` is not a glob pattern and has multiple parts separated by commas.

DONE.
