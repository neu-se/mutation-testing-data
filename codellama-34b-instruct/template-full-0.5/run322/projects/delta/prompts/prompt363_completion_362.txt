  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext()` calls the method and returns the result of the method call, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherIter.hasNext()` is a negation of the boolean value returned by `otherIter.hasNext()`, which would invert the meaning of the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, while `otherIter.hasNext()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements.

DONE.
