  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the original value of `b`, which could cause the calculation to be off by one unit in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the original value of `b`, which could cause the calculation to be off by one unit in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the original value of `b`, which could cause the calculation to have a different result in certain cases.

DONE.
