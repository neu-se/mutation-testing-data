  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 10);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice the first 10 elements of the `ops` array, whereas the original code slices the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(10);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `ops` array starting from the 11th element, whereas the original code slices the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -10);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `ops` array starting from the beginning and ending 10 elements from the end, whereas the original code slices the entire array.

DONE.
