  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the variable `i` instead of incrementing it, leading to a different iteration of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would add 1 to the variable `i` instead of incrementing it, leading to a different iteration of the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would divide the variable `i` by 2 instead of incrementing it, leading to a different iteration of the loop.

DONE.
