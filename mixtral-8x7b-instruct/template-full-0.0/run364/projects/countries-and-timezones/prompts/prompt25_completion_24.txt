 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffsetStr` property of the result object would always be set to the string '0', regardless of the actual dstOffset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffsetStr` property of the result object would always be set to the string '+00:00', regardless of the actual dstOffset value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffsetStr` property of the result object would be set to a random number as a string, instead of the formatted UTC offset string.

DONE.
