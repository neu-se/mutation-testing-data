  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b + 1` would be different from the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a * 2` would be different from the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a + b` would be different from the value of `a`.

DONE.
