  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`. This will prevent the current stream from being aborted, which may cause issues with the stream of streams.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`. This will prevent the current stream from being aborted, which may cause issues with the stream of streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `false`. This will cause the current stream to be aborted, which may cause issues with the stream of streams.

DONE.
