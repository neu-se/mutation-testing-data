  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 instead of 0 when `places` is undefined or null, which would cause the `round` method to always round up to the nearest integer instead of rounding to the nearest decimal place.

DONE.
