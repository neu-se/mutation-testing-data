  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only exits with an error if `a` or `b` is undefined or null, but this new code fragment would exit with an error if `a + b` is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only exits with an error if `a` or `b` is undefined or null, but this new code fragment would exit with an error if `a - b` is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a * b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only exits with an error if `a` or `b` is undefined or null, but this new code fragment would exit with an error if `a * b` is undefined or null.

DONE.
