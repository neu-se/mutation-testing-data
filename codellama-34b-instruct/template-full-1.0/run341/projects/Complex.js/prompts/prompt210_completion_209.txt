  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be dividing the `arg` variable by `b`, which is a different value than the original code that divided it by `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be dividing the `arg` variable by `a+b`, which is a different value than the original code that divided it by `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be dividing the `arg` variable by `2*a`, which is a different value than the original code that divided it by `a`.

DONE.
