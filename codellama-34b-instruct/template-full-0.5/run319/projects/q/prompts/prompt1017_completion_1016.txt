  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, whereas `then` is a method that handles resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, whereas `catch` is a method that handles rejection and returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, whereas `finally` is a method that handles both resolution and rejection.

DONE.
