  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and use the second argument as the first argument for the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first argument as the first argument for the `nodeArgs` array, instead of skipping it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the last argument as the first argument for the `nodeArgs` array, instead of skipping it.

DONE.
