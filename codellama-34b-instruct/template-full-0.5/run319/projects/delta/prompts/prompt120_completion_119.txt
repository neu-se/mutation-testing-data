  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.delete` is a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be used instead of `delete`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `elem.delete` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `elem.delete` is a truthy value.

DONE.
