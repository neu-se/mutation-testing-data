  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(<some other object>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` creates a new function that is bound to a specific `this` context, which may not be the same as the context that `Q(object).dispatch` would be called with.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(<some other object>).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be dispatching a different object than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be calling `dispatch()` immediately, rather than returning a function that can be called later.

DONE.
