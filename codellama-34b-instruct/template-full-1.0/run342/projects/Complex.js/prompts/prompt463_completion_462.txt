  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.abs(b - Complex['EPSILON']) < Complex['EPSILON']```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses '<' instead of '<='.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.abs(b) > Complex['EPSILON']```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses '<' instead of '>'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```j$f(b) < Complex['EPSILON']```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'Math.abs' instead of a function that can be defined as variable.

DONE.
