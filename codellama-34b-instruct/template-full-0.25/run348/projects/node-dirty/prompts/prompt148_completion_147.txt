  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the callbacks to be called in a different order than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array containing the first element of the original array, which would cause only one callback to be called instead of all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb !== cbs[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing all elements of the original array that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would cause all callbacks except the first one to be called.

DONE.
