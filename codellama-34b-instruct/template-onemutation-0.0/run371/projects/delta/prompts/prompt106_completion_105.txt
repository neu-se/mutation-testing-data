  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (op.retain && op.attributes) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the `op` object has an `attributes` property, but the new code fragment also checks if the `op` object has a `retain` property. This means that if an `op` object has a `retain` property but no `attributes` property, it will be filtered out by the new code fragment, whereas it would have been included by the original code fragment.
