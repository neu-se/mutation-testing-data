  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the third "thesis" would match the regex, causing the function to return the wrong plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth "crisis" would match the regex, causing the function to return the wrong plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the fifth "thesis" would match the regex, causing the function to return the wrong plural form.

DONE.
