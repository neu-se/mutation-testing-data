  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `null` as the `this` context, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `undefined` as the `this` context, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(void 0, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would be called with `void 0` as the `this` context, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
