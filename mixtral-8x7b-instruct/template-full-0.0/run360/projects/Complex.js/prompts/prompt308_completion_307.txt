 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of multiplication, which can affect the result due to non-commutativity of multiplication in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(4 * b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of 4 times the square of b, instead of simply multiplying by 2. This can lead to different results due to floating-point precision errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly refers to the 'im' property of the current object, instead of using the variable 'b'. This can lead to different results if the 'im' property is changed or reassigned after the initial declaration.

DONE.
