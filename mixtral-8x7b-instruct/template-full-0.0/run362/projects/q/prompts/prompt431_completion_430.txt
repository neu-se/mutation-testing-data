 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `"rejected"`, even if the promise is fulfilled, since it's accessing the `state` property of an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.constructor.prototype.inspect().state
