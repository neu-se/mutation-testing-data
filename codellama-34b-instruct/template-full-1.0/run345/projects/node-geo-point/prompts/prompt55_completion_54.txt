  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, whereas `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. By using `φ1` instead of `φ2`, the calculation for the bearing would use the latitude of the first point, which could result in a different bearing than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the second point, whereas `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. By using `λ2` instead of `φ2`, the calculation for the bearing would use the longitude of the second point, which could result in a different bearing than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(λ2, φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(λ2, φ1)` is the same as `Math.atan2(
