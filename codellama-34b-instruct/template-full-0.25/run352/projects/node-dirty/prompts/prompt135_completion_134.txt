  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only stringifies the `key` and `val` properties of the object, while this new code fragment stringifies the entire object, which could include additional properties that are not intended to be serialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment stringifies the `key` property of the object, while this new code fragment stringifies the entire object, which could include additional properties that are not intended to be serialized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(val)

DONE.
