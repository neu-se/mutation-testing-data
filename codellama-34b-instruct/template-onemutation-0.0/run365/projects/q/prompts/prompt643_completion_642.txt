  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of passing the entire `args` array as in the original code. This would cause the `dispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the method's implementation.

DONE.
