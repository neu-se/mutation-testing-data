  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a string as its first argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the `clone` method to throw an error, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a string as its first argument, but `undefined` is being passed instead. This would cause the `clone` method to throw an error, which would likely cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method expects a string as its first argument, but a placeholder is being passed instead. This would cause the `clone` method to throw an error, which would likely cause the test to fail.

DONE.
