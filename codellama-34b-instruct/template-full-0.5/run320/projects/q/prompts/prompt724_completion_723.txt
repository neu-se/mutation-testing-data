  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Injected error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, which would trigger the rejection handler in the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a null value, which would not match the expected type of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "injected value"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a different value than the expected one, which could cause the rest of the code to behave differently.

DONE.
