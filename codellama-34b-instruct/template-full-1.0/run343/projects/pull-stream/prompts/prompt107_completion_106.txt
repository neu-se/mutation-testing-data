  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(null, done)` would call the `done` function with `null` as the first argument, while the replacement code fragment would call `done` with `null` as both arguments. This could cause the function to behave differently depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(undefined, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(null, done)` would call the `done` function with `null` as the first argument, while the replacement code fragment would call `done` with `undefined` as the first argument. This could cause the function to behave differently depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(null, console.log)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `(null, done)` would call the `done` function with `null` as the first argument, while the
