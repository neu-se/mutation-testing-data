  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different ranges and properties. In the original code, `cos` is used to calculate the bearing between two points, and replacing it with `sin` would result in a different bearing value, which could lead to incorrect navigation or mapping applications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different ranges and properties. In the original code, `cos` is used to calculate the bearing between two points, and replacing it with `tan` would result in a different bearing value, which could lead to incorrect navigation or mapping applications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different ranges and properties. In the original code, `cos` is used to calculate the
