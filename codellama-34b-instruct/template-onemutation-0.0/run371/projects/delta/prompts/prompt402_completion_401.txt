  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the embed type in the `Object.keys` array is different, which would cause the `handler.transform` method to be called with different arguments, leading to a different result.

DONE.
