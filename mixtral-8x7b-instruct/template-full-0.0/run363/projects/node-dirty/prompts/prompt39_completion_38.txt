 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn(key, val) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality with `true`, which is not the same as checking if the function returns a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the function, meaning that if the function returns a truthy value, it will behave as if the function returned a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn.call(null, key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` value to `null`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the `this` value.

DONE.
