  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 'CORRUPTED_ROW' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would have a different code property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 'CORRUPTED_ROW', rowStr });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would have a different code property and a different rowStr property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 'CORRUPTED_ROW', rowStr, data: this._data });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would have a different code property, a different rowStr property, and a different data property.

DONE.
