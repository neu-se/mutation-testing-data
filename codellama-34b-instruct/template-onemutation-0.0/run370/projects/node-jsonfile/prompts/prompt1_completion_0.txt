  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a string. The original code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check if `options` is a string, which would return `true` if `options` is a string.

DONE.
