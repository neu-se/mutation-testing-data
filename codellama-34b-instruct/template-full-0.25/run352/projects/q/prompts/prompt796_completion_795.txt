  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of `progressed` instead of being resolved with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `progressed` instead of being resolved with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, function () { return progressed; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `progressed` instead of being resolved with the value of `promise`.

DONE.
