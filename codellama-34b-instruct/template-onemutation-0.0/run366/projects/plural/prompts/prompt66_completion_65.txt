  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "memo" to the list of rules, while the modified code fragment adds the singular form of the word "memo" to the list of rules.

DONE.
