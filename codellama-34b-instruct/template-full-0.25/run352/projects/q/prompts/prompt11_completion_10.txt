  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the module would not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the module would not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the module would not be defined.

DONE.
