  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the not operator `!` will invert the boolean value of `done`, so if `done` is originally `true`, it will become `false`, and if it is originally `false`, it will become `true`. This could cause the code that depends on `done` to behave differently, potentially causing unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `done` to `true`, regardless of its original value. This could cause the code that depends on `done` to behave differently, potentially causing unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will evaluate to `true` if `done` is originally `true`, but it will evaluate to `false` if `done` is originally `false`. This could cause the code that depends on `done` to
