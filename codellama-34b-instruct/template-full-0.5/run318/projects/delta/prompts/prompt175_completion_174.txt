  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the next operation in the other Delta, rather than the length of the current operation in the current Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the current operation in the current Delta, plus one, rather than the length of the next operation in the other Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the next operation in the other Delta, minus one, rather than the length of the current operation in the current Delta.

DONE.
