  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present in the URL, while this new code fragment would always replace the protocol with "https://", potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with "http://" if it is not already present in the URL, while this new code fragment would always remove the protocol from the URL, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://www.');
```
This would result in different behavior
