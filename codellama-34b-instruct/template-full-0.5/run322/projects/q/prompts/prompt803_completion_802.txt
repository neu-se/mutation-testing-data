  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a local variable in the `progress` function, and it may not be the same as the `promise` object that the `progress` function is called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Promise` object that the `progress` function is called on, and it may not be the same as the `promise` object that the `progress` function is called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a new `Promise` object that is resolved with the value of the `promise` object, and it may not be the same as the `promise` object that the `progress` function is called on.

DONE.
