  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not a `GeoPoint` object, and would thus cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point.longitude` is the longitude of the `point` object, which is different from `this.longitude`, which is the longitude of the object that the method is being called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `point.latitude` is the latitude of the `point` object, which is different from `this.latitude`, which is the latitude of the object that the method is being called on.

DONE.
