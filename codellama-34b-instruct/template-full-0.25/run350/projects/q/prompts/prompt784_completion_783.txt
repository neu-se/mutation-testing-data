  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause the `then` method to throw an error when it tries to call the `rejected` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, and it would cause the `then` method to throw an error when it tries to call the `rejected` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function is not the same as the original `rejected` callback, and it would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is not rejected.

DONE.
