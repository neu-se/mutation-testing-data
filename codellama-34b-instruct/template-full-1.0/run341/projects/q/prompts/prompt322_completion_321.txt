  Sure, here are my three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the given code fragment with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would be passed as the argument to `descriptor[op].apply()`, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would be passed as the argument to `descriptor[op].apply()`, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Hello, world!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the `descriptor[op]` method as the context and the `args` object as the argument, which could cause the function to throw an error unexpectedly.

DONE.
