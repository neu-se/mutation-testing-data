  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, instead of the original `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.nonExistentProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`, because the property `nonExistentProperty` does not exist on the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`, instead of the original `object`.

DONE.
