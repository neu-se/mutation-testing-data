  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the input string starting from the second character, rather than the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the input string starting from the first character until the last character, rather than the input string starting from the first character until the character before the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the input string starting from the second character until the last character, rather than the input string starting from the first character until the last character.

DONE.
