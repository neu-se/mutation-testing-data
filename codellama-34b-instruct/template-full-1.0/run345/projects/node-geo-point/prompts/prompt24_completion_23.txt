  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['longitude'] !== 'undefined')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `hasOwnProperty` check with a check for undefined, which would result in the code assuming that the `longitude` property is defined on the `object`, even if it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for the `longitude` property altogether. The code would no longer check if the `longitude` property is defined on the `object`, and would instead attempt to read its value, which could result in errors if the property is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `longitude` property with `latitude`. The code would now check if the `latitude` property is defined on the `object`, and would read its value if it is defined.
