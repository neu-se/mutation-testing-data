  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("YES, I AM A BUG!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to log the message "YES, I AM A BUG!" to the console, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let a = 1, b = 2;
console.log(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to log the sum of a and b to the console, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("I am an error!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an Error with the message "I am an error!", whereas the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
