  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with the `final` parameter set to `true`, which would cause the function to return a regex that matches the entire path, instead of just the last segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts` array would be modified, causing the `flatten` function to return a different regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts` array would be modified, causing the `flatten` function to return a different regex.

DONE.
