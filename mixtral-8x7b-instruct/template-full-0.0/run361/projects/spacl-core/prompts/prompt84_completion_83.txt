 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. In this case, the mutated code might not behave as expected because it would not return a cloned array of rules but an array of truthy values instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value. In this case, the mutated code might not behave as expected because it would not return a cloned array of rules but a single value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow
