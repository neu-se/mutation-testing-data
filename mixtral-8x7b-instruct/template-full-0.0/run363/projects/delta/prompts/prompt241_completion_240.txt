 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a fixed length of 1 instead of the length of the next operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use twice the length of the next operation in the iteration, which could cause the deletion of more characters than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.max(length, thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the maximum length between the current length and the length of the next operation in the iteration, which could cause skipping some characters or deleting more characters than intended.

DONE.
