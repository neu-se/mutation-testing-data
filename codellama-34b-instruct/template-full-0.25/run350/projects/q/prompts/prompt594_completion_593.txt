  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, unlike `self` which is a `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, unlike `self` which is a `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, unlike `self` which is a `Promise` object.

DONE.
