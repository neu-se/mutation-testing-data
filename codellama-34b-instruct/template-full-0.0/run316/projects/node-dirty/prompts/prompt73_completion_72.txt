  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for the `ENOENT` error code, while this replacement checks for both `ENOENT` and `EACCES`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the `ENOENT` error code, while this replacement checks for any error code other than `ENOENT`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for the `ENOENT` error code, while this replacement checks for the `EACCES` error code.

DONE.
