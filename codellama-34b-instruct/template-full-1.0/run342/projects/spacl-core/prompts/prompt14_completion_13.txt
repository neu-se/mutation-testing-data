  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error if the spec does not end with a slash, regardless of whether it is a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/(?!$)/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error if the spec ends with a slash, regardless of whether it is a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/(?!\/)/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error if the spec ends with a slash followed by a non-slash character, regardless of whether it is a valid URL.

DONE.
