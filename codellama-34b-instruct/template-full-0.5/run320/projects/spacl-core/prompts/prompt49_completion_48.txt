  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method takes a start and end index, and in the original code, the start index is 1, which means the first character is excluded from the slice. By changing the start index to 0, the first character will be included in the slice, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method takes a start and end index, and in the original code, the start index is 1, which means the first character is excluded from the slice. By changing the start index to 2, the first two characters will be included in the slice, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method takes a start and end index, and in the original code
