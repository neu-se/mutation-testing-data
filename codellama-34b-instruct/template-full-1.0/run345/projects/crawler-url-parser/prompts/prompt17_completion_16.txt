  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
#.*(?:^|/).*$
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a regular expression that matches any character (including line breaks) between "#" and the end of the string, while the original regular expression only matches characters before the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
#.*/#.*$
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a regular expression that matches any character between "#" and the next "/", while the original regular expression only matches characters before the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
#.*?/#.*$
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a non-greedy regular expression that matches any character between "#" and the next "/", while the original regular expression only matches characters before the end of the string.

DONE.
