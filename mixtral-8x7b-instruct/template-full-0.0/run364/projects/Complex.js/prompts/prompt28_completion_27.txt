 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the sign of the input value, which can lead to incorrect results in further calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of the input value, which can lead to incorrect results in further calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential of the input value, which can lead to incorrect results in further calculations.

DONE.
