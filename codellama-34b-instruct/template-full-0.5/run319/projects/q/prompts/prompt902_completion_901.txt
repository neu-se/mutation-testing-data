  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would not be called with the correct error argument, potentially causing the promise to be resolved when it should have been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called with the correct error argument, potentially causing the promise to be rejected when it should have been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function() {
    deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called with a custom error message, potentially causing the promise to be rejected with a different error than the one intended.

DONE.
