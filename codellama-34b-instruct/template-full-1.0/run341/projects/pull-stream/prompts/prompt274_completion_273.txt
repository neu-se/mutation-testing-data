  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the <PLACEHOLDER> should be a function that returns a stream, but replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the <PLACEHOLDER> should be a function that returns a stream, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the <PLACEHOLDER> should be a function that returns a stream, but replacing it with a function that returns `null` would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
