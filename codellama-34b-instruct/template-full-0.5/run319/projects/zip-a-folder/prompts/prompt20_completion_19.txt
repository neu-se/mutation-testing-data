  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream()` creates a new write stream, whereas the original code uses an existing write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not specify any flags, whereas this code specifies the `'w'` flag, which overwrites any existing file with the same name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not specify any flags, whereas this code specifies the `'a'` flag, which appends to an existing file with the same name instead of overwriting it.

DONE.
