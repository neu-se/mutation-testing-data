  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` for all cases, regardless of the value of `op.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisOp[1].length` comparison to always be `true`, regardless of the value of `op.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === thisOp[1].length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisOp[1].length` comparison to always be `false`, regardless of the value of `op.retain`.

DONE.
