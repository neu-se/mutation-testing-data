 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of immediately calling the callback, it wraps the callback in a setTimeout function, which would delay its execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.nextTick.bind(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because process.nextTick schedules the callback to be run immediately after the current operation completes, but by using bind, you are creating a new function that, when called, will return the result of process.nextTick, which is undefined, instead of executing the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit.bind(this, 'drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because bind creates a new function that, when called, will return the result of this.emit('drain'), which is undefined, instead of executing the callback.

DONE.
