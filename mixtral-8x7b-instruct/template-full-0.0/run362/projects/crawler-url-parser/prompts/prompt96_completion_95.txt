 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{href: baseUrlStr}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the href value to the baseUrlStr, instead of parsing the href attribute of the <a> element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[$(this).attr('data-href')]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'data-href' attribute instead of the 'href' attribute of the <a> element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[document.location.href]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the current page's URL as the href value, instead of the href attribute of the <a> element.

DONE.
