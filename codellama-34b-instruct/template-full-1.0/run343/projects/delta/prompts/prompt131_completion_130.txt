  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an empty array onto the `ops` array, rather than the `nextOp` value, which may cause errors or unintended consequences in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops = []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the `ops` array to an empty array, rather than pushing values onto it, which may cause errors or unintended consequences in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[index] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `index`th element of the `ops` array to `null`, rather than pushing a value onto it, which may cause errors or unintended consequences in the code.

DONE.
