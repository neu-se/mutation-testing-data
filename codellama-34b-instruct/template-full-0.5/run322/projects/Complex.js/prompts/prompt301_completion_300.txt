  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(1 - a^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sqrt(1 - a^2)` is the square root of the difference between 1 and the square of the real part of the complex number, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
