  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function than `AttributeMap.invert`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `true` would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `false` would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
