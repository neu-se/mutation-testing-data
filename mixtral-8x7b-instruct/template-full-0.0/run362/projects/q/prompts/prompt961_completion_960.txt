 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an invalid argument, causing unexpected behavior or errors in the `Q.nbind` and `Promise.prototype.nbind` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would treat the `null` value as the starting index, and return the rest of the arguments array, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `Q.nbind` and `Promise.prototype.nbind` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a string with 'use strict' mode would cause a SyntaxError in the `Q.nbind` and `Promise.prototype.nbind` methods, as they are not defined within a strict mode context.

DONE.
