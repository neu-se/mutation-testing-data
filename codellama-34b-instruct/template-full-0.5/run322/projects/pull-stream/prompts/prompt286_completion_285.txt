  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, so the resulting code would always return `null`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate `mapper(data)` if `end` is truthy, so the resulting code would only return `null` if `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would only evaluate `mapper(data)` if `end` is falsy, so the resulting code would only return `null` if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
