  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is strictly equal to `null`. If `done` is a function, for example, this new code fragment would evaluate to `false`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done` is not strictly equal to `undefined`. If `done` is a function, for example, this new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done || done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `done
