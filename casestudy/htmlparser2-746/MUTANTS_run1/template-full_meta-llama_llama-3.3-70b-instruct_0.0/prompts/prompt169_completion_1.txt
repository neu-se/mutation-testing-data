Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.special !== Special.Title && (c === "x" || c === "X")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for a different character ("x" or "X" instead of "t" or "T") and also inverts the check for the `Special.Title` state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.special === Special.Script && (c === "t" || c === "T")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the state being checked from `Special.Title` to `Special.Script`, which could lead to incorrect handling of certain XML/HTML tags.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.special === Special.Title && (c === "s" || c === "S")
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the characters being checked ("s" or "S" instead of "t" or "T"), potentially leading to incorrect handling of title tags.

DONE.
