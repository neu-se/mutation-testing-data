  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `_read` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `_read` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `_read` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is not null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `_read` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `_read` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `_read` is undefined.

DONE.
