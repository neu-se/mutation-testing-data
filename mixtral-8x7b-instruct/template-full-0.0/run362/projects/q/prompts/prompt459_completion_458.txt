 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new empty array and ignores the unhandledRejections array, which could lead to unhandled rejections not being tracked correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections, 'constant'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the promise with a string 'constant', which would cause the untrackRejection function to not find the promise in the unhandledRejections array, and the rejection might not be removed from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections, function() { return promise; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the promise in an anonymous function, which would cause the untrackRejection function to not find the promise in the unhandledRejections array, and the rejection might not be removed from the array.

DONE.
