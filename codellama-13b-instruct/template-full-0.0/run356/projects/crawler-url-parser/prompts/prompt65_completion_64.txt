  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the hostname to lowercase, which could affect the comparison with the `domain` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the hostname to uppercase, which could affect the comparison with the `domain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the hostname into an array of substrings, and the `[0]` index would return the first substring, which could affect the comparison with the `domain` property.

DONE.
