 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffsetStr` property will always be a string with the value '0', regardless of the actual UTC offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(utcOffset)
