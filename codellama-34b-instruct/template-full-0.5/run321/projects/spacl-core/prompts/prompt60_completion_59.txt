  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function would be called with an additional argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function would be called with a different argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function would be called with a different argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
