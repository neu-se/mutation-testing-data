 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be changed to a rejected value, potentially causing the promise chain to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be sent as a progress notification instead of a resolved value, potentially causing the promise chain to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { /* empty function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would not be passed down the promise chain, potentially causing the chain to be broken and not produce the expected results.

DONE.
