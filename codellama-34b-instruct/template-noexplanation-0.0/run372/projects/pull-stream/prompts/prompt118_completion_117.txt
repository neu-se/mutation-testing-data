  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is not equal to `true`. This will result in the `cb` function being called with `null` as the first argument, even if `end` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `end` is equal to `true`. This will result in the `cb` function being called with `end` as the first argument, even if `end` is not `null`.
