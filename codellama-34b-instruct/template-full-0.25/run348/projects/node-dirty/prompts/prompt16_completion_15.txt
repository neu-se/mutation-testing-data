  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` would remove all the items from the queue, whereas the original code only removes the item associated with the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` would remove the item associated with the given key from the queue, whereas the original code only removes the item from the queue if it is the last item in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove the last item from the queue, whereas the original code only removes the item associated with the given key from the queue.

DONE.
