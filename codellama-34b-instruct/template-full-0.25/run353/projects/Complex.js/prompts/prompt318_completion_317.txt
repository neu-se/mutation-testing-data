  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the original code, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the original code, and adding 1 to it would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the original code, and negating it would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
