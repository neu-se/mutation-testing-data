  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "ie"
```
let resArr = Array.from(urlMap.values(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because in this case "<PLACEHOLDER>" is not a valid type for converting to an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "null"
```
let resArr = Array.from(urlMap.values(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because in this case "null" is not an iterable object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "1"
```
let resArr = Array.from(urlMap.values(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because in this case "1" is not an iterable object
DONE.
