 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * field
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the field by 1, which does not change its value but introduces unnecessary complexity. This could potentially cause issues if the `field` value is a number and a multiplication operation is not expected in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof field
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the type of the `field` as a string instead of the `field` value itself. This would cause the `seen` object to store string representations of field types instead of the actual field values, potentially leading to incorrect deduplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field || 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `field` with the string 'default' if `field` is falsy. This could lead to incorrect deduplication if the 'default' string is used as a field value in the input data.
