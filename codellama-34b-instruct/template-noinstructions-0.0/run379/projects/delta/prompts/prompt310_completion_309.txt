  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object, while the replaced code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the inverted operations, while the replaced code fragment returns a new empty Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the inverted operations, while the replaced code fragment returns the original Delta object.

DONE.
