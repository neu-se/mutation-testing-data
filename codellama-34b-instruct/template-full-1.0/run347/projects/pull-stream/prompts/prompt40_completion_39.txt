  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause a SyntaxError, as the `read` argument is not enclosed in parentheses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it will access the `length` property of the `read` object, which may yield a different value than simply using the `read` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will pass `null` as the first argument to `pull()`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
