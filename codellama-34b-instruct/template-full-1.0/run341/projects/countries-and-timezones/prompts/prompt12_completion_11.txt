  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `null`, regardless of the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, regardless of the input data.

DONE.
