  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2`, which calculates the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`, while `x + y` would simply add the two values together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2`, which calculates the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`, while `x - y` would simply subtract the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2`, which calculates the arctangent of `y` divided by `x`, while `y - x` would simply subtract the two values in the opposite order.

DONE.
