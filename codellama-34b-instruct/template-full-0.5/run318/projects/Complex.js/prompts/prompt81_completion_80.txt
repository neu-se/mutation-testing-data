  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the character is a minus sign, while this replacement would check if it is a plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the character is a minus sign, while this replacement would check if it is a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the character is a minus sign, while this replacement would check if it is the letter "i".

DONE.
