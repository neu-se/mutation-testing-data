  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete` only removes the specified element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds a new element to the map, while `delete` only removes the specified element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(baseUrlStr).clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` returns the value associated with the specified key, and `clear()` removes all elements from the map.

DONE.
