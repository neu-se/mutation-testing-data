  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in the passed arguments being replaced with an array containing only the first argument, causing the resulting behavior to differ from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(0, args.length)
```
This would result in the passed arguments being replaced with an array containing all arguments, causing the resulting behavior to differ from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(1, args.length)
```
This would result in the passed arguments being replaced with an array containing all arguments except for the first, causing the resulting behavior to differ from the original code.

DONE.
