  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because `3` is a non-zero number, and `changeLength` will include the value 3 in its calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a non-empty value, and `changeLength` will include the value `null` in its calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a non-empty string, and `changeLength` will include the value `"foo"` in its calculation.

DONE.
