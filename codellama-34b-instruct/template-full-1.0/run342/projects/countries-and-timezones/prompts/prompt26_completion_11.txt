  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the "dstOffset" variable always being set to 0, regardless of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-dstOffset
```
This would result in the "dstOffset" variable being inverted, so a positive value would become negative, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in the "dstOffset" variable being set to null, causing an error if it is used later in the program.

DONE.
