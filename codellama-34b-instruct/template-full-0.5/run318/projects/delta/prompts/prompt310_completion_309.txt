  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return line.length() > 0;`, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the line is non-empty. Replacing it with `return line;` would return the line itself, which is a Delta object, and would likely cause the `eachLine` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line.length() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return line.length() > 0;`, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the line is non-empty. Replacing it with `return line.length() - 1;` would return a different number, which could cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return line.length() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return line.length()
