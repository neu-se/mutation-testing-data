  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^/]+)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a non-capturing group `(?:/[^/]+)` to match a single path segment, while the new code fragment uses a capturing group `([^/]+)` to match the same path segment. The capturing group will create a new entry in the match array, which may cause the test to fail if it is not expecting this additional entry.
