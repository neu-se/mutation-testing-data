  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` would return `e` to the power of the argument, whereas `Math.pow` would return the argument raised to the power of `e`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.map` is a method that creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `Math.pow` is a method that returns the value of a base expression raised to a specified power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a method that returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, whereas `Math.pow` is a method that returns a number representing the value of a base expression raised to a specified power.

DONE.
