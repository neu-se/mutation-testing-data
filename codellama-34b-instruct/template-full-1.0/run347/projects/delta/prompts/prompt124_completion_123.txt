  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to terminate before the end of the `other` delta, potentially resulting in a smaller delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek() == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to terminate when the iterator has been exhausted, potentially resulting in a smaller delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to terminate when the length of the peeked element is 0, potentially resulting in a smaller delta.

DONE.
