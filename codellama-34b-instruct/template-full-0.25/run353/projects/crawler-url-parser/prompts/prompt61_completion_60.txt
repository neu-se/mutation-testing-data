  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object with the parsed URL components, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.normalize` returns a normalized URL string, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

DONE.
