Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `retain` property of the operation instead of calculating the length of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation's length during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(0, Op.length(op) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reduce the length by 1 (unless the length is 0), which could lead to incorrect deletions or retains being applied during the inversion, thus altering the intended structure of the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `insert` property of the operation instead of the length of the operation itself, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about how many characters or elements are being deleted or retained.

DONE.
