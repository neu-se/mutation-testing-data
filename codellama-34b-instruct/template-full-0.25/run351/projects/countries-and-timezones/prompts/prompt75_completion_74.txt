  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `name` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `name` string to uppercase, which could potentially cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `name` string, which could potentially cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

DONE.
