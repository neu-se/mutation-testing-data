Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <Delta>(thisIter.rest());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remaining operations without calling the `chop()` method, potentially leaving the Delta in an unprocessed state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <Delta>(thisIter.rest()).concat(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate an empty Delta to the result, which may alter the expected output by adding unnecessary operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <Delta>(thisIter.rest()).slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first operation from the remaining operations instead of all of them, leading to a loss of data in the resulting Delta.

DONE.
