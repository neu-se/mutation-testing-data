  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the timezone name, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the timezone name starting from the second character, which could cause the `getTimezone()` function to return a different timezone than expected.

DONE.
