  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) || Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` if either `a['abs']` is not finite or `a['arg']` is finite, rather than only if both conditions are met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of the `||` operator, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `true` only if both `a['abs']` is finite and `a['arg']` is finite, rather than if either condition is met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite
