  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null, data)
```
This code fragment uses the `call` method to invoke the `test` function with the `data` argument, but with a `null` context. This can cause the function to behave differently than expected, especially if it relies on the `this` keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null, data)
```
This code fragment uses the `bind` method to create a new function that is bound to the `null` context and has the `data` argument as its first argument. This can also cause the function to behave differently than expected, especially if it relies on the `this` keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.apply(null, [data])
```
This code fragment uses the `apply` method to invoke the `test` function with the `data` argument as an array of arguments. This can also cause the function to behave differently than
