  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` would return both the `end` and `data` values, while the new code fragment `end, null` would only return the `end` value and ignore the `data` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` would return both the `end` and `data` values, while the new code fragment `end, 0` would return the `end` value and a constant value of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` would return both the `end` and `data` values, while the new code fragment `end, function() {}` would return the `end` value and a function that does not return any value.
