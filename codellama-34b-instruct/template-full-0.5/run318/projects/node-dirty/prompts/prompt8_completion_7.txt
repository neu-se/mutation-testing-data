  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `val` is a JSON object, and replacing it with `null` would cause the `set` method to store a null value in the database, rather than the JSON object that was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `val` is a JSON object, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `set` method to store an undefined value in the database, rather than the JSON object that was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `val` is a JSON object, and replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the `set` method to store an empty object in the database, rather than the JSON object that was intended.

DONE.
