  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of φ2 is used in the calculation of the bearing, but φ1 is used in the calculation of the latitude. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of cos(φ1) is used in the calculation of the bearing, but the value of cos(φ2) is used in the calculation of the latitude. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of sin(φ1) is used in the calculation of the bearing, but the value of sin(φ2) is used in the calculation of the latitude. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
