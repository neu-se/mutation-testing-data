  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[args.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the last argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `args` array to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes the `args` array itself.

DONE.
