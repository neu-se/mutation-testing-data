  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `data` argument, while the new code fragment `null` calls the callback function with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `data` argument, while the new code fragment `undefined` calls the callback function with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with the `data` argument, while the new code fragment `"foo"` calls the callback function with the string `"foo"`.

DONE.
