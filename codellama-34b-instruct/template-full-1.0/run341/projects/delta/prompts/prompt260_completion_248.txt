  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the object being mutated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation being performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval(thisOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new, unintended operation.

DONE.
