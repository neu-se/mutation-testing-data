  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the original code fragment checks for `undefined` specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the original code fragment checks for `undefined` specifically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a distinct value from `undefined`, and the original code fragment checks for `undefined` specifically.

DONE.
