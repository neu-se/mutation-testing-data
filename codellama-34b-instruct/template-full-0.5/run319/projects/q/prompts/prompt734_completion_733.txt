  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promises array without the first element, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise that is not fulfilled with the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promises array without the last element, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise that is not fulfilled with the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the promises array, which could cause the `all` function to return a promise that is not fulfilled with the expected value.

DONE.
