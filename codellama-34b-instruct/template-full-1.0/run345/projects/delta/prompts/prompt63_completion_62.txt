  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `attributes` object instead of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the length of the `attributes` object instead of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the length of the `attributes` object minus one instead of the object itself.

DONE.
