  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be incremented by 1, which would change the calculated destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be doubled, which would change the calculated destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude value to be decremented by 1, which would change the calculated destination.

DONE.
