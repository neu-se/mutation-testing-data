  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file directly. Using `fs.readFile` in the `readFileSync` function would cause the function to return a promise instead of the file contents, which would result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
