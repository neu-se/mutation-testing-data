  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character, whereas the `*` operator matches zero or more occurrences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/*/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?:.+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `(?:)` non-capturing group is used to group the `.+` pattern, which matches any character one or more times. This would cause the regex to match any string that ends with a forward slash followed by one or more characters, whereas the original regex only matches strings that end with a forward slash.

DONE.
