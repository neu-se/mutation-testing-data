 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next operation in the array instead of the current one, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous operation in the array instead of the current one, potentially causing incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op.type === 'retain')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the operations to only retain operations and then select the first one, potentially causing incorrect behavior or an error if there are no retain operations.

DONE.
