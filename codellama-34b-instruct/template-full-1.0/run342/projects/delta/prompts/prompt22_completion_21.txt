  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` returns `true` when the two values are not equal, while `isEqual` returns `true` when they are equal. This would cause the `invert` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!((a[key] == b[key]) && (b[key] == a[key]))
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether both the `a` and `b` values are equal to each other, while the original code only checks whether `a` is equal to `b`. This would cause the `transform` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a[key] === b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the two values are not strictly equal, while the original code checks whether they are strictly equal. This would cause the `compose` function to return incorrect
