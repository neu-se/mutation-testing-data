  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation is incorrect, as it is missing the `sinθ` term.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation includes an extra term, which would change the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation includes an extra term, which would change the final result.

DONE.
