  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the array is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, that, that]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra element is added to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra element is added to the array and the order of the elements is changed.

DONE.
