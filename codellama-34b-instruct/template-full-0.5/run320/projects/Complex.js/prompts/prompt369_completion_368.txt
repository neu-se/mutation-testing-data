  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is a different function than `sinh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a different function than `sinh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is a different function than `sinh`.

DONE.
