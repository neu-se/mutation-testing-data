  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` calculation to use the wrong value for `φ1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + π
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` calculation to use a different value for `φ1` that would impact the calculation of `φ2` and the other variables used in the formula.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * π
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` calculation to use a different value for `φ1` that would impact the calculation of `φ2` and the other variables used in the formula.

DONE.
