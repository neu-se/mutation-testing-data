  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable 'a' is not defined or has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable 'b' is not defined or has a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable 'c' is not defined or has a different value.

DONE.
