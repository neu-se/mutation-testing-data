  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`

This would result in different behavior because `null` is a defined value, whereas `args` is a reference to the arguments object of the function that invoked the current function. Using `null` would not give the same result as the original code, which is to forward the arguments of the current function to the `fallback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined`

This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a defined value, whereas `args` is a reference to the arguments object of the function that invoked the current function. Using `undefined` would not give the same result as the original code, which is to forward the arguments of the current function to the `fallback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `args.length`

This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would give the number of arguments passed to the current function, whereas `args` is a reference to the arguments object of the function that invoked the current function. Using `args.length
