  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this new code fragment checks if the `ops` property of `ops` is an array and has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this new code fragment checks if the `ops` property of `ops` is an array and has a length equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && ops.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this new code fragment checks if the `ops` property of `ops` is an array and has a length greater than 1
