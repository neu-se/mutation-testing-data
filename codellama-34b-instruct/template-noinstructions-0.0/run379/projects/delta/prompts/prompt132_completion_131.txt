  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the nextOp onto the ops array, but replacing it with null would push null onto the ops array, which would change the behavior of the slice method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the nextOp onto the ops array, but replacing it with undefined would push undefined onto the ops array, which would change the behavior of the slice method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the nextOp onto the ops array, but replacing it with an empty object would push an empty object onto the ops array, which would change the behavior of the slice method.

DONE.
