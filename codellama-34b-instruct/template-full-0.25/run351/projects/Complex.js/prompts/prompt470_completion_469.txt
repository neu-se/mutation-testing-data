  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `!=` operator checks for non-strict inequality. In this case, the `!==` operator would return `true` if `b` is not equal to `1`, while the `!=` operator would return `true` if `b` is not equal to `1` or if `b` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `!=` operator checks for non-strict inequality. In this case, the `!==` operator would return `true` if `b` is not equal to `0`, while the `!=` operator would return `true` if `b` is not equal to `0` or if `b` is not a number.
