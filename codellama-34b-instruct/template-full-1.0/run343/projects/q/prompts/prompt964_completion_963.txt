  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` usually refers to the current object, while `null` refers to nothing. The method might return a promise that resolves as soon as the continuation is called, without waiting for the given promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` usually refers to the current object, while `undefined` refers to the absence of any value. The method might return a promise that never resolves or rejects if the given promise is never resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` usually refers to the current object, while `true` is a literal Boolean value. The method might return a promise that always resolves with `true`, without waiting for the given promise to resolve.

DONE.
