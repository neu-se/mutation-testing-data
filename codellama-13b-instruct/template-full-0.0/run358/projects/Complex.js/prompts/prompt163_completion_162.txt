  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and therefore the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
