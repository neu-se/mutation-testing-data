  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be false, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be false, causing the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true, causing the function to return the expected value.

DONE.
