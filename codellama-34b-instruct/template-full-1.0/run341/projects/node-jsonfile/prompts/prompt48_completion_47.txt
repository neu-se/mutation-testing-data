  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string, but will now receive null, which could cause an error or lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string, but will now receive undefined, which could cause an error or lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string, but will now receive an empty string, which could cause an error or lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
