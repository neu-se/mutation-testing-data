  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `undefined` is a value that is not a string. In the original code, `match` is compared to `null`, which is a value that is not a string, but `undefined` is a different value that is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `null` is a value that is not a string. In the original code, `match` is compared to `null`, which is a value that is not a string, but `match !== null` would return `true` if `match` is not `null`, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `undefined` is a value that is not a string.
