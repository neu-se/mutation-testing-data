  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `resolvedPromise` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `resolvedPromise` by 2 would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the resolved value of `resolvedPromise` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

DONE.
