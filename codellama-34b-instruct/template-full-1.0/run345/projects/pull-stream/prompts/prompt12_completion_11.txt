  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the loop condition to iterate one more time than the original code, leading to an off-by-one error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the loop condition to iterate one less time than the original code, leading to an off-by-one error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the loop condition to only iterate once, regardless of the value of `length`, leading to a logical error.

DONE.
