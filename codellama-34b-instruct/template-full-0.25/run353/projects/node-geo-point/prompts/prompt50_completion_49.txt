  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the two points using the latitude of the second point instead of the longitude, which would give a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the two points using the longitude of the first point instead of the latitude, which would give a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)

This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the two points using the longitude of the second point instead of the latitude, which would give a different result.

DONE.
