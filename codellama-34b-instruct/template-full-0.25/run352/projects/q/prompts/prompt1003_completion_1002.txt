  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `nodeArgs` array would be removed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive an incorrect argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the `nodeArgs` array would be reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive the arguments in a different order than expected.

DONE.
