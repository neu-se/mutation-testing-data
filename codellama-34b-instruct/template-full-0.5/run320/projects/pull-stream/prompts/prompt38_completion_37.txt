  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the value of `ref[3]` by 1, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the value of `ref[3]`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the value of `ref[3]` by 1, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
