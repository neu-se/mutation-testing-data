  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = tzs[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` object would be mutated, which could cause unintended side effects in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = { ...tzs[key] };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` object would be mutated, but the `tzs[key]` object would be cloned before being assigned to `prev[key]`, which could help prevent unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = Object.assign({}, tzs[key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prev` object would be mutated, but the `tzs[key]` object would be cloned before being assigned to `prev[key]`, which could help prevent unintended side effects.

DONE.
