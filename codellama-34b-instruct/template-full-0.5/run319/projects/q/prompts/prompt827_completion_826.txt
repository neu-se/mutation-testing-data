  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an unhandled error occurs, and setting it to `void 0` would prevent it from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Unhandled error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when an unhandled error occurs, which would be caught by the `onUnhandledError` function and passed to `Q.onerror`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Unhandled error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console when an unhandled error occurs, which would be caught by the `onUnhandledError` function and passed to `Q.onerror`.

DONE.
