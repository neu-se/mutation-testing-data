  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function on `sourceUrl` instead of `embedBaseUrlStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `baseUrl` to the `url` property of `parse(embedBaseUrlStr)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would format the `baseUrl` object into a URL string before passing it to `parse`.

DONE.
