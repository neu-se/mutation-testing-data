  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a different function than `rejected`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("rejected")` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas `rejected` would only reject the promise with no error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `rejected`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved with no value instead of rejected.

DONE.
