  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function throws an error, while this new code fragment would always reject the promise with the `deferred.reject` function itself, regardless of whether an error was thrown or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function does not throw an error, while this new code fragment would always resolve the promise with the `deferred.reject` function itself, regardless of whether an error was thrown or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

deferred.reject(new Error("Error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the `de
