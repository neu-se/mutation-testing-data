  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current op is an insert and has a length less than or equal to the first left, while the new code fragment checks if the current op is an insert and has a length less than the first left.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the current op is a delete and has a length less than or equal to the first left, while the new code fragment checks if the current op is a delete and has a length less than the first left.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' && thisIter.peekLength() <=
