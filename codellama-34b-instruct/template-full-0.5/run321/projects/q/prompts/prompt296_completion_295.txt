  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join `y` with the resolved value of `x`, rather than joining `x` with `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(Q.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise returned by `Q(x)` and return a new promise that is resolved with the value of `x`, rather than joining `x` with `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return Q.reject(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise returned by `Q(x)` with the value of `x`, rather than joining `x` with `y`.

DONE.
