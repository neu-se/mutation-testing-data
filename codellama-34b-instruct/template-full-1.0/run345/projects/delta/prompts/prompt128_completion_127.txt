  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was meant to calculate the distance between the start of the array and the current element, but instead, `start + index` would calculate the distance between the start of the array and the end of the element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was meant to calculate the distance between the end of the array and the current element, but instead, `end - index` would calculate the distance between the start of the array and the end of the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was meant to calculate the distance between the start of the array and the current element, but instead, `index * 2` would calculate the distance between the start of the array and twice the current element.

DONE.
