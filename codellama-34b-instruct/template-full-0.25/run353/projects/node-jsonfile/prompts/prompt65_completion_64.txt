  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the search value, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\uFEFF/g` matches the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, whereas the original code fragment only matches the BOM if it is the first character in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a space character, whereas the original code fragment replaces the BOM with an empty string.

DONE.
