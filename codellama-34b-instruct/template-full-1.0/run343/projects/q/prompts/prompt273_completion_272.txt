  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress(null)` is a function call, while `progress` by itself is a reference to a variable or object property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.progress` is a reference to a property of an object, while `progress` by itself is a reference to a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress++
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress++` is an incrementing operation, while `progress` by itself is a reference to a variable.

DONE.
