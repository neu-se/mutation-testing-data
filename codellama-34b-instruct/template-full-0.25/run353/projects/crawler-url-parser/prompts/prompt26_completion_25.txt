  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence with a space. This could potentially change the behavior of the `URL.parse()` method, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the first occurrence with an ampersand. This could potentially change the behavior of the `URL.parse()` method, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces the first
