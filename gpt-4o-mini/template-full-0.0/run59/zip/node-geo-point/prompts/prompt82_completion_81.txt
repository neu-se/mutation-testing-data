Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the cosine of the latitude instead of the sine, leading to an incorrect calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the sine of the latitude, which would distort the calculation of the destination point, potentially resulting in an invalid geographical location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the sine of the latitude, which would alter the angular distance calculation and lead to an incorrect destination point.

DONE.
