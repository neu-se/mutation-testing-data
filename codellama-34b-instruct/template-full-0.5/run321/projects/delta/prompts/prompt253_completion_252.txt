  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be incremented by 1, which would cause the iteration to skip over the last operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be decremented by 1, which would cause the iteration to skip over the first operation in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the operation would be doubled, which would cause the iteration to visit each operation twice in the delta.

DONE.
