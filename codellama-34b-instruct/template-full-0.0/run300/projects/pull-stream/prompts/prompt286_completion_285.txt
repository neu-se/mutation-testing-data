  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `data` variable to be set to `null` even if `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `mapper(data)` function to be called only if `end` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `mapper(data)` function to be called only if `end` is `false`.

DONE.
