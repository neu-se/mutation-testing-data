  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than 0, while the new code fragment is checking if the length is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than 0, while the new code fragment is checking if the length is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the length of the string is greater than 0, while the new code fragment is checking if the length is null.

DONE.
