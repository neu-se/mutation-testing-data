  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because `!mapper` is a boolean value, while `mapper` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper(data)` is a function call, while `mapper` is a function reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper.call(null, data)` is a method call, while `mapper` is a function reference.

DONE.
