 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[row.key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly deletes the key from the `_data` object, bypassing the built-in `Map.prototype.delete` method. This could potentially cause issues if the `_data` object has any custom behavior for the `delete` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all key-value pairs from the `_data` object, not just the single key specified by `row.key`. This would cause unintended data loss and is unlikely to be the desired behavior in most cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data = new Map()
```
This would result in different behavior because it completely replaces the `_data` object with a new, empty `Map` instance. This would cause unintended data loss and is unlikely to be
