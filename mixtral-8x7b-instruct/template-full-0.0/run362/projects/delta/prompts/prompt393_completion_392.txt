 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next.bind(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound function, which, when called, will not have the correct `this` context. The original code fragment uses the `next` method directly, which ensures that the correct `this` context is used when calling the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an arrow function, which, when called, will not have the correct `this` context. The original code fragment uses the `next` method directly, which ensures that the correct `this` context is used when calling the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next.call(thisIter)
