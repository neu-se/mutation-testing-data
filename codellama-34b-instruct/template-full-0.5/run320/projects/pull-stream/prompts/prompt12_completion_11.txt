  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially leading to a bug if the loop is expected to execute at least once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute at least once, potentially leading to an infinite loop if the loop is expected to execute at most once.

DONE.
