  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to iterate over the `other` delta's operations instead of the `this` delta's operations, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to peek at the next operation in the `this` delta instead of advancing to the next operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to peek at the next operation in the `other` delta instead of advancing to the next operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
