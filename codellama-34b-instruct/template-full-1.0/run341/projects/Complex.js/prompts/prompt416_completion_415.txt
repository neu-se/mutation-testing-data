  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the result of the expression to always be positive, whereas the original expression would be positive when a and b are the same sign and negative when a and b are different signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the signs of the result of the expression, so the result would be opposite to the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the +1 constant, so the result would be different.

DONE.
