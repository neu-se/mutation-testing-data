  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the callback is in the list, while the original code simply appends the callback to the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code appends the callback to the list, while this code checks if the list is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.some(cb => cb !== cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `some` method checks if any element in the list is not equal to the callback, while the original code simply appends the callback to the list.

DONE.
