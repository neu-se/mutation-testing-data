  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise, while this new code fragment rejects it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with no arguments, while this new code fragment resolves it with an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve('Hello, world!')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with no arguments, while this new code fragment resolves it with a string.

DONE.
