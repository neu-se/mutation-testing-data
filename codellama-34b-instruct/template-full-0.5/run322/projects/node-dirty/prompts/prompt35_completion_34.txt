  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `undefined` are not the same in JavaScript. While `undefined` means that a value has not been assigned to a variable, `null` is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'undefined', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'undefined'` is not the same as the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 0, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number value and not a `undefined` value.

DONE.
