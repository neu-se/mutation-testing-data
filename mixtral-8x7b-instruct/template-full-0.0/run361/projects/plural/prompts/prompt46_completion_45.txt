 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiou]o/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of a vowel before "o" instead of checking if "o" is at the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o/
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't consider case-insensitive matching, which was present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[aeiouy]o/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the pattern matches, but doesn't perform the replacement as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
