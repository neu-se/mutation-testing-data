  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is the opposite of `isEqual`, and would return `true` if the two values are not equal, whereas `isEqual` would return `true` if the two values are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNot` is a negation of `is`, and would return `true` if the two values are not the same, whereas `isEqual` would return `true` if the two values are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotSame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotSame` is a negation of `isSame`, and would return `true` if the two values are not the same, whereas `isEqual` would return `true` if the two values are the same.

DONE.
