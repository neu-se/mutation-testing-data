 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data[field]
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes `field` is a string and tries to access it as a property of the `data` object, whereas the original `prop` function correctly handles both string and function `field` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => field
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the `field` function itself instead of calling it to get the value to use as the key for the `seen` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => seen.length++ % data.length === 0 ? data[field] : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a complex condition to determine the key, which is unlikely to match the original behavior of the `prop` function.

DONE.
