  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isNaN` function, causing the `toString` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks whether the number is finite, whereas the `isNaN` function checks whether the number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the real and imaginary parts of the number are both zero, whereas the `isNaN` function checks whether the number is not a number.

DONE.
