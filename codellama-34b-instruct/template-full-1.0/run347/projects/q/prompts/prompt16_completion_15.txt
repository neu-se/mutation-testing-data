  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" && typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the original condition, causing the script to be executed in the browser, even if the `window` or `self` objects are not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require both the `window` and `self` objects to be defined, making the script incompatible with Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only require the `self` object to be defined, making the script incompatible with the browser.

DONE.
