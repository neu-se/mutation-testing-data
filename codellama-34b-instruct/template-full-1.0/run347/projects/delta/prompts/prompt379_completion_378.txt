  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(OtherIterator.next(length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `OtherIterator` into the `delta` array, rather than the next operation from the `thisIter` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next().reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `thisIter` array into the `delta` array, but in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the `otherIter` array into the `delta` array, rather than the next operation from the `thisIter` array.

DONE.
