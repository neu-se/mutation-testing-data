  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the parent context of the current context, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.child
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the child context of the current context, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.sibling
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the sibling context of the current context, which may not be intended.

DONE.
