Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the length of the operation, potentially causing an off-by-one error in the retention of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `next()` to retrieve the operation and then calculates its length, which may lead to unintended side effects by advancing the iterator before the length is determined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always retains a length of 0, effectively ignoring the actual length of the operation and potentially leading to loss of data during the transformation process.

DONE.
