  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size()` method returns the number of entries in the map, whereas the `get()` method returns the value for the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.containsKey( embeddingBaseUrlStr )
```
This would result in different behavior because the `containsKey()` method checks if the given key exists in the map, whereas the `get()` method returns the value for the given key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().size()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns a Collection view of the values contained in the map, whereas the `get()` method returns the value for the given key.

DONE.
