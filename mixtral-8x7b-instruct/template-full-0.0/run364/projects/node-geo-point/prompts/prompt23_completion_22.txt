 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint.fromObject` method would expect an object with a `longitude` property twice, instead of `latitude` and `longitude`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `GeoPoint.fromObject` method would sometimes receive a random number instead of a valid `latitude` value, causing the constructor to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'invalid'
