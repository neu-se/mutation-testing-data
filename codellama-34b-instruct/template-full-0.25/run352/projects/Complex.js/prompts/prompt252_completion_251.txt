  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosm1(b)` is not a valid function in JavaScript, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.cosm1(b)` is a typo and should be `Math.cos(b) - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Math.cosm1(b)` is a typo and should be `Math.cos(b) - 1`.

DONE.
