  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"longitudee"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a property `longitudee` that does not exist, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitudee
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a property `longitudee` that does not exist on the `coordinate` object, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate[longitudee]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a property `longitudee` that does not exist on the `coordinate` object, causing an error.

DONE.
