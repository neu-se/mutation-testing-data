Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the substring from index 1 instead of 0, effectively omitting the first character of the word before appending 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the entire word in the substring, resulting in 'es' being appended to the original word instead of the modified version.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last three characters of the word instead of the last two, which could lead to incorrect pluralization for words that do not conform to this rule.

DONE.
