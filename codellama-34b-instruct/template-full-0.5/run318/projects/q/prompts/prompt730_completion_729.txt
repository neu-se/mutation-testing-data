  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("progress")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the deferred object with the string "progress", which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the deferred object with the promise object itself, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(index, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the deferred object with the index and value of the progress, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
