  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` expects a string as input, but `tokens[i + 1]` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` expects a string as input, but `tokens[i + 1]` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and multiplying it by a number would change the value of the expression.

DONE.
