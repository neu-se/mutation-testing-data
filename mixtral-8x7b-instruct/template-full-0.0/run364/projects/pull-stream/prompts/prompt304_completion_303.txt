 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes only two arguments (error and data) to the callback, while the modified one passes three arguments (error, data, and an extra boolean value).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object as the first argument to the callback, while the modified one passes a boolean value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(ended, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment calls the `read` function again instead of calling the callback, which may cause an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
