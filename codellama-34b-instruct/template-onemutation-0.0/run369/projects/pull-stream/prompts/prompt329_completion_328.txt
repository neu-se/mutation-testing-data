  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which means that the `op` function will not be called if `op` is truthy. In the original code, `op` is called if `op` is truthy, which means that the code will behave differently if `op` is not called.

DONE.
