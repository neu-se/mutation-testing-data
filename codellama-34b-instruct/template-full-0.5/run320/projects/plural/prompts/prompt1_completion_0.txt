  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called with the arguments 8 and -1, which would return a different substring of the object's string representation than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called with the argument -1, which would return the last character of the object's string representation, rather than the first 8 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).substring(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with the arguments 8 and -1, which would return a different substring of the object's string representation than the original code fragment.

DONE.
