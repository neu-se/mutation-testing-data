  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "functionfoo" instead of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof(rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "function" instead of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the function instead of the original string.

DONE.
