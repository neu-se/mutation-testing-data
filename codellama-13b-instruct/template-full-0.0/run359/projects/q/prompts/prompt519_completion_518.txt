  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is used to notify the promise that a change has occurred, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is used to resolve the promise, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
