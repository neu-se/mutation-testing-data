 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof object === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider `null` as not a promise, while the original code considers it as a pending promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object && typeof object.then === 'function'
