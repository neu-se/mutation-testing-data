  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means there is no '\n' character in the chunk. However, this new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is greater than -1, which means there is at least one '\n' character in the chunk. This change would cause the code to enter the `if` block even if there is no '\n' character in the chunk, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means there is no '\n' character in the chunk. However, this new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is 0, which means there is at least one '\n' character at the beginning of the chunk. This change would cause
