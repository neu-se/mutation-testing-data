  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, onAbort)` would pass the `onAbort` function as the second argument to `cb`, whereas the modified code fragment `cb(null, abort)` would pass the `abort` variable as the second argument to `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, onAbort)` would pass `null` as the first argument to `cb`, whereas the modified code fragment `cb(abort, null)` would pass the `abort` variable as the first argument to `cb`.
