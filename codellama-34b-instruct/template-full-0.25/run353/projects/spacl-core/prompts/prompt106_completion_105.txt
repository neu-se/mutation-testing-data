  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is not being called with the correct arguments. The `matches` method expects two arguments, `path` and `ctx`, but the code fragment only passes one argument, `path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is being called with an additional argument, `true`, which is not expected. This could cause the method to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is being called with an additional argument, `false`, which is not expected. This could cause the method to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
