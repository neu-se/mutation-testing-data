  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks the type of the `stack` property, while the new code fragment checks the truthiness of the `stack` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` check is different from the `undefined` check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"undefined"` is not the same as the `undefined` value.

DONE.
