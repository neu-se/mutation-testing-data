 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` refers to the value of `this` in the context where the function is called, while the original code uses `void 0` (which is equivalent to `undefined`) as the default value for `this`. This change may cause issues if the function being applied is not called with the correct `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `name` is `null` or `undefined`, the function will attempt to call `value.apply(null, args)` instead of `value.apply(void 0, args)`. This may cause issues if the function being applied relies on the value of `this` being `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global
```
This would result in different behavior because `global` is a variable that refers to the global object (`window` in a browser environment
