  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.trim()` would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the data, while `data` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.toUpperCase()` would convert the data to uppercase, while `data` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split(',').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.split(',').join('')` would split the data on commas and then join it back together with no delimiter, while `data` would not.

DONE.
