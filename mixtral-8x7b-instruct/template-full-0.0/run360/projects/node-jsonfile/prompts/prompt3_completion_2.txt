 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read a file from a relative path, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior if the file is not located in the correct directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the file to be read with the 'utf8' encoding, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior if the file is not encoded in 'utf8'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the synchronous version of the `readFile` function, potentially causing performance issues or blocking the event loop if the file is large or takes a long time to read.

DONE.
