  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a different function than `requestPortTick`, and it would cause the code to execute a different action.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the code to terminate and not execute the rest of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (arg) {
    return arg + 1;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code, which would cause the rest of the program to execute with a different input.

DONE.
