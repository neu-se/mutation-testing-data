  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to a potential error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would be called with a `null` value for the `rhs` argument, which might cause an error if the method is not designed to handle `null` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method would be called with an `undefined` value for the `rhs` argument, which might cause an error if the method is not designed to handle `undefined` values.

DONE.
