  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, without waiting for the write stream to drain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called immediately, without waiting for the write stream to drain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called immediately, without waiting for the write stream to drain.

DONE.
