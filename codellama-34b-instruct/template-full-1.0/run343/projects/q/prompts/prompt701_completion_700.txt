  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it may not contain the same values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first element of the `arguments` array, whereas the original code takes all of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first two elements of the `arguments` array, whereas the original code takes all of the elements.

DONE.
