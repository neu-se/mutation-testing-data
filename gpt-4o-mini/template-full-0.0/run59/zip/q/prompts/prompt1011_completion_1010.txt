Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = function() { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `defer` function to return an empty object instead of a deferred object, which would break the promise resolution mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `defer` to `null` would cause a runtime error when trying to call `defer.makeNodeResolver()`, as `null` does not have the method `makeNodeResolver`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer = function() { return { makeNodeResolver: function() { return "error"; } }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `makeNodeResolver` method to return a string "error" instead of a function, which would lead to incorrect handling of the callback in the promise chain.

DONE.
