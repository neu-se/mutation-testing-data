  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the cosine.

DONE.
