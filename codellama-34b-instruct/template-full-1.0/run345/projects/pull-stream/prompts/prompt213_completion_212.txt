  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is not defined and would return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is null and would return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `aborted` variable is an empty object and would return an error.

DONE.
