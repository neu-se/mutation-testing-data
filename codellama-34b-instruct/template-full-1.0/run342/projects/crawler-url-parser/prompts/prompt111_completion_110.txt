  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Not a base URL"
```
This would result in different behavior because the Placeholder represents the base URL, and if it is replaced with a different value, it will no longer represent the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the Placeholder is a non-empty string, but the replaced code fragment is an empty string, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"example"
```
This would result in different behavior because the Placeholder represents the base URL, which may have a specific format or structure, but the replaced code fragment is a simple string that does not have the same structure or format.
DONE.
