  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the wrong index in the array, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the wrong index in the array, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a random index in the array, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
