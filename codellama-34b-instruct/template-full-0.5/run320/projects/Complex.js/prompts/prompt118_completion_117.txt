  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method would return a different value, and the `+ 1` would cause the result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method would return a different value, and the `* 2` would cause the result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` method would return a different value, and the `- 1` would cause the result to be different.

DONE.
