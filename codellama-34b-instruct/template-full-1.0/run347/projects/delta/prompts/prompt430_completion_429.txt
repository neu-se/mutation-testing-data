  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `peekLength` method with the current `offset` value, but passing 0 as the argument would always return 0, regardless of the actual offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
peekLength(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `peekLength` method with the current `offset` value, but passing -1 as the argument would always return -1, regardless of the actual offset value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
peekLength(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `peekLength` method with the current `offset` value, but passing Infinity as the argument would always return Infinity, regardless of the actual offset value.

DONE.
