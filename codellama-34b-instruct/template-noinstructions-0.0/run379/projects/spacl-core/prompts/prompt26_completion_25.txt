  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `min` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `min` is less than 0. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `min` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `min` is equal to 0. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `min` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `min` is not equal to 0. This would cause the regex to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
