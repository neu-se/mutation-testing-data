  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality between the `rule[0]` and `word` variables, while the buggy code fragment uses the `==` operator to check for loose equality. This could result in different behavior if the `rule[0]` and `word` variables are not of the same type or if they have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] === word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to check for strict equality between the `rule[0]` and `word` variables, while the buggy code fragment uses the `==` operator to check for loose equality.
