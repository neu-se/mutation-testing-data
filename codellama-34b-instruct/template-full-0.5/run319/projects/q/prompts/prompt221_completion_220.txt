  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object with a different prototype, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a different value, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different reason, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
