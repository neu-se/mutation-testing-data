  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it accesses the second-to-last element in the `ops` array instead of the last element. This could potentially cause the `compose` method to produce different results than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This code fragment accesses the first element in the `ops` array, which could potentially cause the `compose` method to produce different results than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1] + 1
```
This code fragment adds 1 to the length of the `ops` array, which could potentially cause the `compose` method to produce different results than expected.

DONE.
