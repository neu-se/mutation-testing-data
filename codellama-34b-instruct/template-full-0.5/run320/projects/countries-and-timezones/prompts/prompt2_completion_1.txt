  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(data.timezones[id] || {}).current || []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `current` property of the timezone object, rather than the `all` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(data.timezones[id] || {}).all || []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `all` property of the timezone object, rather than the `current` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(data.timezones[id] || {}).all.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a shallow copy of the `all` property of the timezone object, rather than the original array.

DONE.
