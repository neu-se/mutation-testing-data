  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` variable, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property is not defined on the `object` variable, so it would return `undefined` instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` variable, so it would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a string.

DONE.
