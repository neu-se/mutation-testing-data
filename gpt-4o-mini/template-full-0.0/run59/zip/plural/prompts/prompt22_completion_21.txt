Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllab|foc|fung|cact/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is missing the correct endings for "syllabus," "focus," "fungus," and "cactus," which would cause the pluralization rules for these words to not be applied correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactuses/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex incorrectly includes "cactuses" instead of "cactus," which would lead to incorrect pluralization for the word "cactus" as it would not match the intended rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus|cactus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex includes "cactus" twice, which is redundant and could lead to unexpected behavior in the matching process, potentially causing the rule to be applied incorrectly or not at all.

DONE.
