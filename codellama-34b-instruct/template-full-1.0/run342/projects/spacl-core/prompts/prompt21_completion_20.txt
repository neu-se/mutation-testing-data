  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment performs a check to ensure that the path does not end with a slash, but `undefined` would evaluate to false in this context, allowing a path that ends with a slash to pass the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the existence of a slash in the path, but `''` is an empty string, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `parts` array to construct the regular expression for matching the path, but `parts[0]` would be the first part of the path, not the full path, and could potentially match a different set of paths.

DONE.
