  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `abort` function to be called even if the `abort` argument is `false`. This could cause the stream to be aborted prematurely, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `abort` function to be called only if the `abort` argument is `true`. This could cause the stream to be aborted too late, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would cause the `abort` function to be called only if the `abort` argument is `true`, and would cause the stream to be aborted too late if the `abort` argument is `false`. This could cause the stream to
