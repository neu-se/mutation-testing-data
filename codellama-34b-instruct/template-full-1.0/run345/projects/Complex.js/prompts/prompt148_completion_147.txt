  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] * z['re'] + this['im'] * z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` is used instead of the division operator `/` in the original code fragment. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] / z['re'], this['im'] / z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator `/` is used instead of the multiplication operator `*` in the original code fragment. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
