  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop()` method is called on the concatenated delta, which would remove any trailing newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop()` method is not called on the concatenated delta, which would preserve any trailing newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called on the concatenated delta, which would remove the last element of the delta, which is a newline character.

DONE.
