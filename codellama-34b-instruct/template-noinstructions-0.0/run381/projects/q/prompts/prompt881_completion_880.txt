  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `deferred.reject(exception)`, which would reject the promise with the error object, whereas the new code fragment would reject the promise with the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `deferred.resolve(value)`, which would resolve the promise with the value, whereas the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had `deferred.notify(value)`, which would notify the promise with the value, whereas the new code fragment would notify the promise with the error message.

DONE.
