  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` would be considered falsy if it is an empty object or any other object with no own enumerable properties. In the original code, `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object, which is different from checking if it's falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` would be evaluated first, and if it's falsy, the expression would immediately evaluate to `false`. In the original code, `a` and `b` are evaluated separately, and the result of the entire expression depends on both values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ? b : !b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is truthy, and if so, return `b`. Otherwise, it would return the negation of `b`. In the original code,
