  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator to return both `null` and `array[i++]`, while this code fragment only returns `array[i++]`. This could cause issues if the code relies on the return value of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` after returning the value, while this code fragment does not. This could cause issues if the code relies on the side effects of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the current value of `i` to access the array, while this code fragment uses the next value of `i` to access the array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the current value of `i` to access the array.
