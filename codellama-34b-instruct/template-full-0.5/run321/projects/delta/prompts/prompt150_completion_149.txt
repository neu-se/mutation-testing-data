  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` returns the next operation in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `otherIter.next` advances the iterator and returns the next operation. If the code fragment is replaced with `otherIter.peek`, the `while` loop will never terminate, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are any more operations in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` advances the iterator and returns the next operation. If the code fragment is replaced with `otherIter.hasNext`, the `while` loop will never terminate, causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(1)` advances the iterator by one
