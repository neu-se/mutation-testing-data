  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = asin(sinφ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `φ2 = asin(sinφ2)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x)`.

DONE.
