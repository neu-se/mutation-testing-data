  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "es" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it ends in a consonant or a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "is" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it ends in a consonant or a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "ies" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it ends in a consonant or a vowel
