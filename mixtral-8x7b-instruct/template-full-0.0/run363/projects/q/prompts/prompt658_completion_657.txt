 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `PLACEHOLDER` value would be incremented by 1, changing the number of arguments passed to the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` expects an array-like object as its first argument, and `null` would not meet this requirement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which may not be the intended behavior. The original code fragment uses `<PLACEHOLDER>` to skip the argument, while still passing the correct number of arguments to `array_slice`.

DONE.
