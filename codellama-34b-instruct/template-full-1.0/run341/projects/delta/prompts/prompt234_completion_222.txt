  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and they have different purposes. `insert` is used to insert a new operation into the delta, while `push` is used to append an operation to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(length, { color: 'red' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a `retain` operation with a `{ color: 'red' }` attribute to the end of the delta, which would have different effects on the document than the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lowerDelta.concat(retDelta)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `lowerDelta` and `retDelta` deltas, which would have different effects on the document than the original behavior.

DONE.
