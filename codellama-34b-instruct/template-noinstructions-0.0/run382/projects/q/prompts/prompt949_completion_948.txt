  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behaviors when it comes to handling the `this` context and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that is bound to the specified `this` context and arguments, whereas `call` and `apply` invoke the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` returns a new function that is bound to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) as the `this` context, whereas `call` and `apply` use the original `this` context.

DONE.
