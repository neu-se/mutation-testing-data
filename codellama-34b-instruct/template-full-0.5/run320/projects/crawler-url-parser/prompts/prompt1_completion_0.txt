  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-sensitive, meaning it would match uppercase letters as well as lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive, meaning it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
