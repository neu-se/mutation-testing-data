  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL is properly formatted, while 'https://' would result in a different protocol being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include the 'www.' subdomain, while this replacement would include it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a placeholder to indicate that the base URL should be used, while this replacement would use a specific URL.

DONE.
