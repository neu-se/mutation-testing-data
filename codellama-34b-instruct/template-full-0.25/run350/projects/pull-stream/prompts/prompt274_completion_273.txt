  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `values` function to be called on the `stream` object, which is not what the original code intended. The `values` function is used to extract the values from an object, but in this case, `stream` is not an object, it's a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = stream.once()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called on the `stream` object, which is not what the original code intended. The `once` function is used to ensure that a function is only called once, but in this case, `stream` is not a function, it's an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = stream.pipe()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pipe` function to be called on the `stream` object, which
