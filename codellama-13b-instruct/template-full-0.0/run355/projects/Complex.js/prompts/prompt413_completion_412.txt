  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` calculates the logarithm of a number to the base 10, while `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` calculates the logarithm of a number to the base 2, while `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log1p
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log1p` calculates the natural logarithm of a number plus 1, while `Math.log` calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

DONE.
