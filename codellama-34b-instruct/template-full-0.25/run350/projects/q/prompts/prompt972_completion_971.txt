  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array starting from the second element, instead of the original `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which would change the number of arguments passed to the `name` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a new array to the `name` function, where each element is the original element plus 1.

DONE.
