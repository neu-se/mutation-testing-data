  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `for` loop to never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `for` loop to execute indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `for` loop to never execute.

DONE.
