  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is shifted to the left by 1 element before passing it as an argument to the `Q.nbind` function, while in the modified code, the `arguments` object would be passed as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `arguments` is shifted to the left by 1 element before passing it as an argument to the `Q.nbind` function, while in the modified code, the `arguments` object would be shifted to the right by 1 element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `arguments` object is passed as is to the `Q.nbind` function, while in the modified code, the `arguments` object is converted
