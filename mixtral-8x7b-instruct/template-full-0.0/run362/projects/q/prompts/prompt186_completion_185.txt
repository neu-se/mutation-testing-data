 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the negated character class `[^ ]` matches any character except a space, but the original fragment matches any character including a space. This change may cause the regular expression to fail to match some stack lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at (.+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.+` matches one or more of any character, whereas the original fragment matches one or more non-space characters. This change may cause the regular expression to match more stack lines than intended, including those with spaces in the function name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at ([^)]+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
