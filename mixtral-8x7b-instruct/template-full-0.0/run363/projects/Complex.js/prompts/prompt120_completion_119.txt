 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the modified condition checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() * z['isInfinite']()
