  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the cosine of the input value, while the new code fragment computes the negative sine of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the cosine of the input value, while the new code fragment computes the tangent of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment computes the cosine of the input value, while the new code fragment computes the inverse cosine of the input value.

DONE.
