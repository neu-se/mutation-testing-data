  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` is a promise object, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a new rejected promise object, whereas `Q.defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

DONE.
