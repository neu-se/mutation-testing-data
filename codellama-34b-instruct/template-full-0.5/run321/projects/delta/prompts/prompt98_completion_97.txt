  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have a `retain` property, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `retain` property, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `retain` property, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
