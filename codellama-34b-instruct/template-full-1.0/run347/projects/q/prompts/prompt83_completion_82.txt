  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be negating the `flushing` variable, causing the `if` statement to always execute, regardless of the value of `flushing`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!laterQueue.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be negating the `laterQueue.length` property, causing the `if` statement to always execute, regardless of the length of the `laterQueue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing || laterQueue.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would be combining two conditions, causing the `if` statement to execute if either `flushing` is truthy or `laterQueue.length` is greater than zero.

DONE.
