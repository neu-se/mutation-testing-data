  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This code fragment is a correct implementation of the original code, but it is not a mutation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This code fragment is a mutation that changes the behavior of the original code. The original code checks if the `embedType` is not equal to the first key in the `b` object, while this mutation checks if the `embedType` is equal to the first key in the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This code fragment is a mutation that changes the behavior of the original code. The original code checks if the `embedType` is not equal to any of the keys in the `b` object, while this mutation checks if the `embedType` is included in the `b` object.
