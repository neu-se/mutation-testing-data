  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line !== "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out lines that contain the string "foo", while the new code fragment filters out lines that are equal to the string "foo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!line.startsWith("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out lines that contain the string "foo" anywhere in the line, while the new code fragment filters out lines that start with the string "foo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.indexOf("foo") !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out lines that contain the string "foo" anywhere in the line, while the new code fragment filters out lines that contain the string "foo" only at the beginning of the line.

DONE.
