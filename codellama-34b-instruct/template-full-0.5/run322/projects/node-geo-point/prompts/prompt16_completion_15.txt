  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[1], point.coordinates[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the calculated distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0], point.coordinates[1] + 10);
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value is increased by 10 degrees, which would cause the calculated distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] + 5, point.coordinates[1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value is increased by 5 degrees, which would cause the calculated distance and bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
