Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the path contains a slash anywhere in the string, rather than ensuring that the path starts with a slash, which could allow invalid paths to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[^/]/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first character of the path is not a slash, which would incorrectly allow paths that start with any character other than a slash, thus failing to enforce the requirement that paths must begin with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the match result is not `undefined`, which would incorrectly allow the code to proceed even if the path does not start with a slash, as it would not throw an error for invalid paths.

DONE.
