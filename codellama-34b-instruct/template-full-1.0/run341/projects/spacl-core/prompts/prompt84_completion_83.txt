  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array, whereas `map` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, whereas `map` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.

DONE.
