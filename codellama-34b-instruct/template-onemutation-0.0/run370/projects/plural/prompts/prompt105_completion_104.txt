  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the word unchanged, while the new code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word.

DONE.
