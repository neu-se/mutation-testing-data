  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.key` would return the value of the `key` property of the `object`, while `object` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[0]` would return the first element of the `object` array, while `object` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.property` would return the value of the `property` property of the `object`, while `object` would return the object itself.

DONE.
