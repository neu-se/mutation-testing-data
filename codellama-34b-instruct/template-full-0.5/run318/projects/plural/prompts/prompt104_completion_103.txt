  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment appends an 's' to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment removes the last character of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while this new code fragment removes any 's' characters from the end of the input word.

DONE.
