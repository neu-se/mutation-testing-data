  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a method that returns a new string from a specified start index to the end of the string, while `slice` is a method that returns a new string from a specified start index to a specified end index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split(':')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings, while `slice` is a method that returns a new string from a specified start index to a specified end index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches, while `slice` is a method that returns a new string from a specified start index to a specified end index.

DONE.
