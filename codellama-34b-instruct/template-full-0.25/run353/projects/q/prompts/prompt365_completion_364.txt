  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is always true, whereas `done` is true only when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done && false` is always false, whereas `done` is true only when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `done || true` is always true, whereas `done` is true only when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
