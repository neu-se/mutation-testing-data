  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, but `null` is a truthy value. The original code fragment `null, data` would return the value `data` in the callback, while the mutated code fragment `undefined, data` would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, but `null` is a falsy value. The original code fragment `null, data` would return the value `data` in the callback, while the mutated code fragment `true, data` would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'', data
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a falsy value, but `null` is a truthy value. The original code fragment `null, data` would return the value `data` in the callback,
