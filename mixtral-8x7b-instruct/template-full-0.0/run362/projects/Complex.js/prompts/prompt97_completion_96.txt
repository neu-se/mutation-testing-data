 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat('invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to parse an invalid string as a floating-point number, which would result in NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in a division by zero error, which would be represented as Infinity or -Infinity in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to calculate the natural logarithm of a negative number, which is undefined.

DONE.
