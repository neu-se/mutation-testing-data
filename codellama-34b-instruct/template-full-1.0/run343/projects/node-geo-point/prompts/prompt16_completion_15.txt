  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[1], point.coordinates[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the coordinates are passed in reverse order, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to create a `GeoPoint` instance with unexpected values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] + 1, point.coordinates[1] + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the coordinates are incremented by 1, which would cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to create a `GeoPoint` instance with unexpected values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] * 2, point.coordinates[1] * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the coordinates are multiplied by 2, which would cause the `fromGeo
