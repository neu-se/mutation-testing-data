  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would change the behavior of the code that handles the result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments passed to the `nodeback` function, which could cause issues if the function expects a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it would change the behavior of the code that handles the result of the promise.

DONE.
