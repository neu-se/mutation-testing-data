  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp` and `otherOp` are different variables, and using `thisOp` instead of `otherOp` would cause the code to operate on the wrong data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different value than `otherOp`, and using `otherOp.insert` instead of `otherOp` would cause the code to operate on the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `otherOp`, and using `null` instead of `otherOp` would cause the code to operate on the wrong data.

DONE.
