  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This change will cause the iterator to always return the next op in the list, rather than the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This change will cause the iterator to always return the previous op in the list, rather than the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This change will cause the iterator to always return the op after the current op, rather than the current op.

DONE.
