  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Placeholder, null>
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `abort`, and it would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Placeholder, abort?true:false>
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional operator `?:` is being used to evaluate a different expression than the original code. The resulting value would be either `true` or `false`, depending on whether `abort` is truthy or not, and this would also cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<Placeholder, abort||true>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is being used to coerce the value of `abort` into a boolean, and this would cause the `read` function to be called with a
