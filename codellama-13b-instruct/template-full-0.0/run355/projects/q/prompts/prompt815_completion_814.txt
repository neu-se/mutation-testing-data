  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error object, which would trigger the rejection handler in the `finally` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(123)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `123`, which would trigger the fulfillment handler in the `finally` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q.resolve(123), function (value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `124`, which would trigger the fulfillment handler in the `finally` block.

DONE.
