  Welcome to Mutation Testing! I'll make sure to apply mutation testing to the code you provided and report the results.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not have the same base URL to work with, which could cause it to return a different URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(currentUrlStr === baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not have the same base URL to work with, which could cause it to return a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr !== baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would not have the same base URL to work with, which could cause it to return a different URL.

DONE.
