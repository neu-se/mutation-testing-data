  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys of the map, rather than the values. This would cause the `currentUrl` variable to hold a key from the map, rather than a value, which would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the map, rather than just the values. This would cause the `currentUrl` variable to hold a key-value pair from the map, rather than just a value, which would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the values in the
