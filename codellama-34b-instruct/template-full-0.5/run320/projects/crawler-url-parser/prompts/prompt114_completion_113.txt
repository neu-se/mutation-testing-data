  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const url of urlMap.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the keys of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const url of urlMap.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the entries of the `urlMap` object, which are arrays containing the key and value for each entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const url of urlMap.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the values of the `urlMap` object, rather than the keys.

DONE.
