 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules a callback to be run in the next iteration of the event loop, while `this.once` is used to add a one-time listener for the 'drain' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules a callback to be run after a minimum threshold in milliseconds, while `this.once` is used to add a one-time listener for the 'drain' event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.has('drain') ? this._queue.get('drain').shift()() : null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly gets and removes the first callback from the 'drain' queue, if it exists, and immediately invokes it without checking if there are any more items in the queue
