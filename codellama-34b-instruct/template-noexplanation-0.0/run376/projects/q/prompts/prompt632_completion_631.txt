  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This change will cause the `del` method to delete the property with the specified key and value, rather than just the property with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, true]
```
This change will cause the `del` method to delete the property with the specified key and value, and also return a promise that resolves to the deleted value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, false]
```
This change will cause the `del` method to delete the property with the specified key and value, but not return a promise that resolves to the deleted value.

DONE.
