  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument `1`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 'foo'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different value for the `drain` event, which would cause the event to be emitted with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', { foo: 'bar' }); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different value for the `drain` event, which would cause the event
