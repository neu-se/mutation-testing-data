 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the next operation as a delete, even if it's not. This could lead to unexpected results or test failures when the next operation should not be treated as a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call the `peekType` method, which could cause issues if the `OpIterator` is not properly initialized or if the `ops` array is empty. This could lead to test failures or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the next operation as an insert, even if it's not. This could lead to unexpected results or test failures when the next operation should not be treated as an insert.

DONE.
