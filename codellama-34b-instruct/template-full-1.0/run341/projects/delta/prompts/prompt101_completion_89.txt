  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element in the array instead of the first one, leading to a different array length and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element in the array instead of the last one, leading to a different array length and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an element to the beginning of the array instead of removing one, leading to a different array length and behavior.

DONE.
