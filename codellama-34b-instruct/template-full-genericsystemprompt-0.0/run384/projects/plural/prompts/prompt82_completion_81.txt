  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "mouse" as "mice", while this new code fragment adds it as "mouses".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "mouse" as "mouses", while this new code fragment adds it as "mice".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mous')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "mouse" as "mouses", while this new code fragment adds it as "mous".

DONE.
