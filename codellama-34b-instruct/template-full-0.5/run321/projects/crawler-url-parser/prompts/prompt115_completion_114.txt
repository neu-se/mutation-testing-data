  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, while `values` returns an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, while `values` returns an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` creates a new array from an iterable object, while `values` returns an iterator over the values in the map.

DONE.
