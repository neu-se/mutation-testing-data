  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` with the message `'Invalid Param'`, while the modified code fragment would throw a `SyntaxError` with the message `'Invalid Param1'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` with the message `'Invalid Param'`, while the modified code fragment would throw a `SyntaxError` with the message `'Invalid Param1'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` with the message `'Invalid Param'`, while the modified code fragment would throw a `SyntaxError` with the message `'Invalid Param1'`.

DONE.
