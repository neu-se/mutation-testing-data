  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
thisIter.next(Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), so sometimes the next operation will be skipped or only a partial operation will be retrieved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
thisIter.next(Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a numeric value that is greater than any other number, so `thisIter.next(Infinity)` would return all remaining operations in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
thisIter.next(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that is used to represent the absence of a value, so `thisIter.next(null)` would return the next operation with a null value, which may not exist in the iterator.

DONE.
