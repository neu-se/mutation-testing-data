  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function from the Pythagorean theorem to the arc tangent of the sum of the lengths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function from the Pythagorean theorem to a sum of the lengths with the absolute value of the second length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function(a + b, c + d)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function from the Pythagorean theorem to a function with different inputs and outputs.

DONE.
