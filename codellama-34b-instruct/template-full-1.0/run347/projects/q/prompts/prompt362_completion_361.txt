  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always lead to the rejected branch of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always lead to the progressed branch of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a value of `null`, instead of the expected value.

DONE.
