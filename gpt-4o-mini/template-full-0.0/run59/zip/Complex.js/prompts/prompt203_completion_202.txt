Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the square root of `b` instead of raising `b` to the power of `z['re']`, which would yield a fundamentally different result when `b` is negative or zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of `b` instead of raising `b` to the power of `z['re']`, which would ignore the sign of `b` and lead to incorrect results in the context of complex exponentiation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the natural logarithm of `b` instead of raising `b` to the power of `z['re']`, which would produce a complex number that does not represent the intended exponentiation of `b`.

DONE.
