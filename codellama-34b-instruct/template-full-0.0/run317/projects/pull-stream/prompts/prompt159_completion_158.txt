  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a variable, while `_value + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `_value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a variable, while `value` is a function parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `_value` is a variable, while `onAbort` is a function parameter.

DONE.
