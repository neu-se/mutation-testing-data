  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10()` returns the base-10 logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.log()` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.log()` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp()` returns the exponential function of a number, whereas `Math.log()` returns the natural logarithm.

DONE.
