  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, while the mutated code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, while the mutated code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, while the mutated code fragment returns the result of calling the `mapper` function with `data` as an argument.

DONE.
