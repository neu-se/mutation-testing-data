  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return "object" for any object, including non-promise objects, whereas `isPromiseAlike` would only return true for objects that have a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` would only return true for objects that are instances of the `Promise` class, whereas `isPromiseAlike` would return true for any object that has a `then` method, regardless of its class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `then` method is defined on the object, whereas `isPromiseAlike` would check if the object is a promise by calling the `then` method and checking if it returns a promise.

DONE.
