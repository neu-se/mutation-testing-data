  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable as the second argument to the `atan2` function, which is used to compute the arctangent of the complex number. Replacing `a` with `0` would cause the function to return a different value, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
