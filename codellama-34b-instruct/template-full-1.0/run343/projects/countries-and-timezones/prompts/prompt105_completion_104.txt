  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key + 1]: tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` adds an additional offset to the key, which would cause the function to return a different timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key.toUpperCase()]: tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.toUpperCase()` converts the key to uppercase, which would cause the function to return a different timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key + '_']: tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `' + '_'` adds an additional underscore to the key, which would cause the function to return a different timezone.

DONE.
