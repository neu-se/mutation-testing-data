  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `ctx`, and the `query` method expects to receive a query context object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `ctx`, and the `query` method expects to receive a query context object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and the `query` method expects to receive a query context object with specific properties and methods.

DONE.
