  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a non-`Exception` argument, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown when trying to access the `reason` property of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with no arguments, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown when trying to access the `exception` property of the rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a non-`Exception` argument, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown when trying to access the `reason` property of the argument.

DONE.
