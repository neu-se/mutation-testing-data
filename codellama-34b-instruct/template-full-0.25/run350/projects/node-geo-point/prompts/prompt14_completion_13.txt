  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the input is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not necessarily equal to 0, even if the array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the array contains a specific value, which may not be the case if the array is empty.

DONE.
