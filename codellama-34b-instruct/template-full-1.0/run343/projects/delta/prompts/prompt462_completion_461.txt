  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest` method returns an array of `Op` objects starting from the current index, and `slice(1)` would return the same array without the first element, which is the current `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index` would refer to the current index in the `rest` method, which would return an array of `Op` objects starting from the current index, and `slice(this.index)` would return the same array without the first element, which is the current `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` would return a new array with the `rest` array followed by the `this.ops` array starting from
