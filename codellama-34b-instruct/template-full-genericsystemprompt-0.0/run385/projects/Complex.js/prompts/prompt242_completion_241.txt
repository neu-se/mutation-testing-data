  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
