  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'!' + drain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator flips the truthiness of the result of `drain`, which could cause the callback to be called with an unexpected argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'undefined' + drain
```
This would result in different behavior because the string concatenation operator `+` will not throw an error if `drain` is undefined, but it will return `NaN` instead of a meaningful value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null + drain
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and when used as an operand in the `+` operator, it will be converted to a number (0), which could cause the callback to be called with an unexpected argument.

DONE.
