  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is replacing newline characters with tabs, which would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is replacing newline characters with spaces, which would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is replacing newline characters with a new line and a tab, which would produce a different output.

DONE.
