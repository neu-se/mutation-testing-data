  Here are three potential mutations for the PLACEHOLDER in the code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the acc variable to be a string concatenation of the previous value and the current data, rather than the intended behavior of reducing the data using the reducer function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the acc variable to be the subtraction of the current data from the previous value, rather than the intended behavior of reducing the data using the reducer function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the acc variable to be the multiplication of the current data with the previous value, rather than the intended behavior of reducing the data using the reducer function.

DONE.
