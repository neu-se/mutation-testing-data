  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of whether the key exists in the object or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `false`, regardless of whether the key exists in the object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of whether the key exists in the object or not, as long as the key is a property of the object.

DONE.
