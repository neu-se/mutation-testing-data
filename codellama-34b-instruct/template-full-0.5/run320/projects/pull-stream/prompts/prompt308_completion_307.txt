  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended` is a boolean value that determines whether the stream has ended, while `!ended` is the negation of that value, so it would cause the stream to continue even if it has already ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended` is a boolean value that determines whether the stream has ended, while `ended && false` is a boolean value that is always false, so it would cause the stream to never end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `ended` is a boolean value that determines whether the stream has ended, while `ended || true` is a boolean value that is always true, so it would cause the stream to always end.

DONE.
