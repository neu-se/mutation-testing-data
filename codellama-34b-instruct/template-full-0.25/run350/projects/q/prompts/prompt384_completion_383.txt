  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will reject the promise with the value returned by `callback.fcall(value)`, whereas `thenResolve` would resolve the promise with that value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` takes a function that returns a promise, whereas `thenResolve` takes a value that is used to resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function () { throw value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` takes a function that returns a promise, whereas `thenReject` takes a value that is used to reject the promise.

DONE.
