  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which will overwrite any existing file with the same name, whereas the original code used the default `flags` value of `'a'`, which will append to an existing file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'`, which will write the file as a UTF-8 encoded string, whereas the original code used the default `encoding` value of `'binary'`, which will write the file as a binary stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { mode: '0666' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is set to `'0666'`, which will set the
