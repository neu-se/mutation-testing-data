 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it may cause division by zero error when `θ` is 90 or 270 degrees, while the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(Math.abs(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a positive value, while the original code returns both positive and negative values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.cos(θ))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an exponential function, which can lead to much larger or smaller values than the original code.

DONE.
