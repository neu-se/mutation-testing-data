 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(x / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates `cosh(x)` using the Taylor series when `x` is small, while this replacement would calculate the square root of `exp(x)`, which is not equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates `cosh(x)` using the Taylor series or the definition of `cosh(x)` when `x` is not small, while this replacement would replace the base of the exponential function with a constant, which is not equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates `cosh(x)` using the Taylor series or the definition of `cosh(x)` when `x` is not small, while this replacement would
