  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"result"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a string with the value "result", regardless of the actual value of the `result` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `result` plus 1, regardless of the actual value of the `result` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of `result` multiplied by 2, regardless of the actual value of the `result` variable.

DONE.
