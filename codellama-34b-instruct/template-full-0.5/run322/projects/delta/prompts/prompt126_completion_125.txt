  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the index is less than the start index, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the index is greater than the start index, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the index is less than the start index, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
