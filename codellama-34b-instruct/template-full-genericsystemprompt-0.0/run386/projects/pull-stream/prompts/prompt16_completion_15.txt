  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object is one less than the actual number of arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments.length` property is one less than the actual number of arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments.length` property is two less than the actual number of arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
