  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would modify the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is used in the `parse` function to determine the base URL of the current page. By replacing "http://" with "https://", the `parse` function would interpret the URL as an HTTPS URL, which could cause it to behave differently.
