This would result in different behavior because the `become` function is called with a promise that is resolved with the value, rather than the value itself. This would cause the promise to be resolved with a promise that is resolved with the value, rather than the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.resolve(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` function is called with the value, rather than the promise that is resolved with the value. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the value, rather than a promise that is resolved with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.when(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is called with the value, rather than the promise that is resolved with the value. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the value, rather than a promise that
