 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
plural.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `plural` function, potentially causing issues if the function relies on `this` referring to a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
plural.call(null, this, num)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `plural` function to `null`, potentially causing issues if the function relies on `this` referring to a specific object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
plural.apply(null, [this, num])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` within the `plural` function to `null`, potentially causing issues if the function relies on `this` referring to a specific object.

DONE.
