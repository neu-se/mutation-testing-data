Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object, causing the function to return `undefined` regardless of the input, thus failing to preserve any attributes from `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.keys(b).reduce<AttributeMap>((copy, key) => { return copy; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an empty `attributes` object, effectively ignoring all properties from `b`, leading to a loss of data that should have been included in the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = Object.keys(b).reduce<AttributeMap>((copy, key) => { copy[key] = null; return copy; }, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set all attributes from `b` to `null`, which would change the intended functionality of preserving the values from `b` and could lead to incorrect results in the composed attributes.

DONE.
