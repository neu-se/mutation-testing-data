  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not the same as the `b` variable in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is multiplied by 2, which changes the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number, which changes the final result.

DONE.
