  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, while the mutated code fragment returns `null`. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, while the mutated code fragment returns `undefined`. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `data` variable, while the mutated code fragment returns the string `"hello"`. This could cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

DONE.
