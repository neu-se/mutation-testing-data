  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always start from the first property of the object, rather than the property at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would start from a random property of the object, rather than the property at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = this[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would start from the property at the current index, rather than the property at the first index.

DONE.
