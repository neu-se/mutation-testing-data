  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for a negative sign, while this code fragment would look for any character that is not a hyphen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for a hyphen, while this code fragment would look for any character that is not a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'z'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for a hyphen, while this code fragment would look for the letter "z".

DONE.
