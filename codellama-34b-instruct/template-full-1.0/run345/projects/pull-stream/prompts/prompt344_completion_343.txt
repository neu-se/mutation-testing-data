  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function with no arguments, whereas the original code calls it with the `abort` variable as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `onAbort` variable to `null`, whereas the original code leaves it as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort ||= null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `onAbort` variable to `null` only if it is falsy (i.e., `false`, `null`, `undefined`, etc.), whereas the original code always sets it to `null`.
