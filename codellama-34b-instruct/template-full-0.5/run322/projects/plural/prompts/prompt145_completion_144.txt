  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns a string indicating the type of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different way of getting the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different way of getting the type of an object.

DONE.
