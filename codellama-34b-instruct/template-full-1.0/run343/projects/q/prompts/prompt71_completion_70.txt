  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is used to call a function every specified number of milliseconds, whereas `setTimeout` is used to call a function once after a specified number of milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind(window, flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that, when called, has its `this` set to the first argument, and the first argument is the `flush` function. Therefore, `setTimeout.bind(window, flush)` would result in `flush` being called repeatedly every specified number of milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is used to cancel a previously set interval timer, whereas `setTimeout` is used to call a function once after a specified number of milliseconds.

DONE.
