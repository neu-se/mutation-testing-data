 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] instanceof RegExp && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `rule[0]` is an instance of RegExp instead of comparing the type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0] === 'object' && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `rule[0]` is an object and has a `test` method, which is true for other types of objects as well, not just RegExp.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor.name === 'RegExp' && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `rule[0]` is an instance of RegExp by comparing the `constructor.name` property, which can be manipulated or overwritten.

DONE.
