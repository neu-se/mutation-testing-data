  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the `bearing` variable, potentially causing the `calculateDestination` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would change the value of the `bearing` variable, potentially causing the `calculateDestination` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of the `bearing` variable, potentially causing the `calculateDestination` function to return a different result.

DONE.
