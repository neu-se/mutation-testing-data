  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(x).join(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).join(y)` is a promise that resolves to the result of joining `x` and `y`, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
