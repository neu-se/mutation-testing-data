  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.abs(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases, especially when dealing with negative numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(Math.abs(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases, especially when dealing with negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc(Math.abs(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` returns the integer part of a number, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number. This could cause the function to return incorrect
