Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the original value directly instead of an array, causing the `fulfilled` function to receive a single argument instead of an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would spread the `value` into a new array, which may not be the intended behavior if `value` is not iterable, potentially leading to a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `this.all` method to receive `null`, which would likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior when trying to resolve the promise.

DONE.
