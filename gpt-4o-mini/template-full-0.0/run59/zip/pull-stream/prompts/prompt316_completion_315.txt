Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with `null` for the data instead of terminating the read process, potentially leading to unexpected results in the consumer of this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of `ended` to the callback instead of terminating the read process, which could cause the consumer to receive an incorrect state of the reading process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Terminated'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the callback with an error object instead of terminating the read process normally, which could disrupt the expected flow of data handling in the consumer.

DONE.
