  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = (a - b) + (a - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform the subtraction twice, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = (a + b) - (a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform the addition twice, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = a * a - b * b;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square `a` and `b`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
