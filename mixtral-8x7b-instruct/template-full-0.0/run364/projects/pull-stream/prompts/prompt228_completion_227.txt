 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment attempts to access the property `prop` of the `data` object, which may not exist, causing a `TypeError`. The original code simply returns the `data` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment attempts to add 1 to the `data`, which may not be a number, causing a `TypeError`. The original code simply returns the `data` as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment uses the logical NOT operator `!` on the `data`, which may not be a boolean, causing unexpected results. The original code returns the opposite of the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
