  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid object, but `null` is not a valid object and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid object, but `undefined` is not a valid object and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid object, but `{}` is an empty object and would cause a different behavior in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
