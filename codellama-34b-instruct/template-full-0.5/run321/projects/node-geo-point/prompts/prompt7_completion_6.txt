  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with two elements, while the original code only checks if the `type` property is defined and the `coordinates` property is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with more than two elements, while the original code only checks if the `type` property is defined and the `coordinates` property is an array with two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point' && point.coordinates.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior
