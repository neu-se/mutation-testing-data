 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would return a promise that is always resolved with a value of `null`, instead of returning the original promise unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Replacement error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would always reject the returned promise with an error, instead of passing the original promise through unaffected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Replacement error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tap` method would throw an error instead of simply executing the provided callback function and passing the original promise through unaffected.

DONE.
