  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` returns an array of strings, whereas `match()` returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `match()` returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString().match('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` would convert the array to a string, and then `match()` would search for an empty string within the string, which would always return a truthy value.

DONE.
