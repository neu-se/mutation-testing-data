  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule` array contains pairs of regular expressions and replacement strings, and the first element of each pair is a regular expression that is used to match the input word. By replacing `rule[0]` with `rule[1]`, the regular expression is ignored and the replacement string is used as the match condition, which would result in a different set of rules being applied to the input word.
