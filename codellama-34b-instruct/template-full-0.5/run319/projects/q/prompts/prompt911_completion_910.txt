  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `baseArgs` array, while `concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `baseArgs` and the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the `baseArgs` array, while `concat()` concatenates the `baseArgs` and `nodeArgs` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the `baseArgs` array, while `concat()` concatenates the `baseArgs` and `nodeArgs` arrays.

DONE.
