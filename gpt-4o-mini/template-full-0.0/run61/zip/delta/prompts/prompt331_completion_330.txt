Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the entire operation object to just its attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling during the retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the inserted content instead of the base operation itself, which could lead to incorrect retention of operations based on their length rather than their actual content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the delete property of the base operation instead of the operation itself, which could cause the logic to incorrectly handle operations that should be retained or pushed based on their delete status.

DONE.
