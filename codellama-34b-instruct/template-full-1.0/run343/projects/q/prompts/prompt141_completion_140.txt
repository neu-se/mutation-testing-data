  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
p = Promise.resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve(undefined)` is a resolved promise, which would cause the loop to exit immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
p = Promise.reject(new Error());
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(new Error())` is a rejected promise, which would cause the loop to continue running forever.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
p = Promise.reject(new Error("mock error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(new Error("mock error"))` is a rejected promise with a specific error message, which would cause the loop to continue running forever and throw an error when the loop is exited.

DONE.
