  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a variable, while the replacement code fragment `"placeholder"` is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a variable, while the replacement code fragment `id + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `id` is a variable, while the replacement code fragment `data.timezones[id].name` is an expression that accesses the `name` property of the `data.timezones` object using the value of `id` as the key.

DONE.
