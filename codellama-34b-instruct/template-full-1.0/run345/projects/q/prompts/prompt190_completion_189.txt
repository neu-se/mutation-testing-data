  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the wrong index to access the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using an index that is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[Math.floor(Math.random() * attempt2.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using a random index to access the array.

DONE.
