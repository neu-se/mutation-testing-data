  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/([^/]+)` matches any character that is not a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment `parts.push` pushes a string literal to the `parts` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `([^/]+)` matches any character that is not a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment `parts.push` pushes a string literal to the `parts` array.

DONE.
