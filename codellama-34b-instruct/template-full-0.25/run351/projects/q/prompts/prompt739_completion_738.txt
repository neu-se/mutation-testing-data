  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` is a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`, which is a placeholder for a value that has not been provided yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("error message"))` is a rejected promise with an error message, whereas the original code fragment `Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)` is a resolved promise with a value of `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a deferred promise that has not yet been resolved
