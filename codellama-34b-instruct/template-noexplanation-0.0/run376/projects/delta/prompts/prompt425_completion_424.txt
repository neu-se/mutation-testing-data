  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'object'
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `module` is not an object, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'undefined'
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `module` is undefined, which is a different condition than the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'string'
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `if` block when `module` is a string, which is a different condition than the original behavior.

DONE.
