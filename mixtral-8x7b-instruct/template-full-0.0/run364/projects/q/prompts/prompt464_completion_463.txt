 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections.push(promise);` line would not add the promise to the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, since `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, null)` would always return -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, {})` would not match any elements in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, since `{}` creates a new empty object each time it is evaluated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, [])` would not match any elements in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, since `[]` creates a new empty
