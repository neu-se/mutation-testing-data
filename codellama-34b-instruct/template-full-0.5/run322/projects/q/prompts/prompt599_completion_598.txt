  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with a single element, which is the original `args` array, instead of passing the `args` array as a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as a single argument, instead of passing the entire `args` array as a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `args` array as a single argument, instead of passing the entire `args` array as a single argument.

DONE.
