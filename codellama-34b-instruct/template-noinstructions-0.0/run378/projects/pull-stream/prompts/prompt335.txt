Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

//a pass through stream that doesn't change the value.
module.exports = function through (op, onEnd) {
  var a = false

  function once (abort) {
    if(a || !onEnd) return
    a = true
    onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
  }

  return function (read) {
    return function (end, cb) {
      if(end) once(end)
      return read(end, function (end, data) {
        if(!end) op && op(data)
        else once(end)
        cb(end, <PLACEHOLDER>)
      })
    }
  }
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
data
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
