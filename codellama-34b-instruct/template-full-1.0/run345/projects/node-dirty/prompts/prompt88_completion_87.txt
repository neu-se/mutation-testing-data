  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would return and remove the first element of the array, while `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return and remove the last element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return and remove the element at the index specified by `<PLACEHOLDER>`, while `arr.pop()` would return and remove the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return and remove the element at the index specified by `<PLACEHOLDER>`, while `arr.shift()` would return
