  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to return all elements except the last one, rather than the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to return all elements except the first and last, rather than just the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to return all elements, including the first one, rather than just the first.

DONE.
