  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deferred"
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be a deferred object, rather than a promise, which could cause unexpected behavior when using the returned value in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be undefined, rather than a promise, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior when using the returned value in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be null, rather than a promise, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior when using the returned value in the test suite.

DONE.
