  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 3)` to remove the last three characters. This would cause the plural form of words ending in "thesis" or "crisis" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es'` to add the "es" suffix to the plural form of words ending in "thesis" or "crisis", while this new
