  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `read_close` event with a value of `0`, which is not the same as the original code that emits the event without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `read_close` event with the size of the `_data` object, which is not the same as the original code that emits the event without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `read_close` event with the size of the `_data` object plus one, which is not the same as the original code that emits the event without any arguments.

DONE.
