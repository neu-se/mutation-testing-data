  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 && b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checked if both `a` and `b` were less than 3000, but this new condition checks if both are greater than 3000, which would reverse the logic and potentially cause the function to return different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 3000 || b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checked if both `a` and `b` were less than 3000, but this new condition checks if either `a` or `b` is less than 3000, which would change the logic and potentially cause the function to return different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 4000 && b < 4000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition
