  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that reads the contents of a file and returns the contents as a string, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file and returns the contents as a string in a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null)` is a bound function that returns a new function with the `fs.readFile` function as its `this` value and the `null` value as its `this` value, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file and returns the contents as a string in a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.read
