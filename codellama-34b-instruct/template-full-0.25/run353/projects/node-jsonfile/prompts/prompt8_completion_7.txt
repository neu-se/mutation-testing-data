  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = JSON.parse(data)

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stripBom` is a function that removes the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of a string, while `JSON.parse` is a function that parses a JSON string and returns a JavaScript object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stripBom` is a function that removes the BOM (
