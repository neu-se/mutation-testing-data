  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/\w+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a more general regular expression to match any character, while the new code fragment only matches word characters (letters, digits, and underscores). This change would cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression for the `Matcher` class, which could potentially cause the `Matcher` class to produce different results for certain inputs.

DONE.
