  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `0` if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `1` instead of `10`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10` instead of `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `Math.PI` if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, which would cause the `Math.pow
