  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is not called with the correct argument, which is the new value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called with the wrong argument, which is the original value instead of the new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is called with a null value instead of the new value.

DONE.
