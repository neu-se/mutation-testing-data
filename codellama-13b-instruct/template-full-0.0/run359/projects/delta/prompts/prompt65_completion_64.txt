  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the `newOp` object, which is a new instance of the `Op` class, rather than the `this` object, which is the current instance of the `Delta` class. This would cause the `insert` method to be called on a different object, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called on the `this.ops` array, which is a different object than the `newOp` object. This would cause the `push` method to be called on a different object, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the `this.ops[index -
