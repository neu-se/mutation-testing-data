  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.then(function() { throw error; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only throw the error if the promise is rejected, while the modified code fragment would throw the error regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw error; }).catch(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only throw the error if the promise is rejected, while the modified code fragment would throw the error if the promise is rejected and then catch the error and return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw error; }).then(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only throw the error if the promise is rejected, while the modified code fragment would throw the error if the promise is rejected and then return a resolved promise.
