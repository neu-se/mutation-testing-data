  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate until the length of the array is not equal to the current index, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
