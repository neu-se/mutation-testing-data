  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword is not used in the original code fragment, which means that the `verbs` variable is not being accessed from the correct context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method is not used in the original code fragment, which means that the `verbs` variable is not being iterated over correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method is not used in the original code fragment, which means that the `verbs` variable is not being accessed correctly.

DONE.
