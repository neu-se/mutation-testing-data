  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the exception object, while this replacement throws the exception message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the exception object, while this replacement throws the exception stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the exception object, while this replacement does not throw anything.

DONE.
