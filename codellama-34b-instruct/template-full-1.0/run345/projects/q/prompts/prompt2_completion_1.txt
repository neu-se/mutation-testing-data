  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "foo" is not a function and would throw an error when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns undefined instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would throw an error if the variables a and b are not functions.

DONE.
