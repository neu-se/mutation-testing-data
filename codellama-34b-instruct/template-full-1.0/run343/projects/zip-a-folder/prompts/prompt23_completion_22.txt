  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Archiver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Archiver instance, which may have different configuration and behavior than the original instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Archiver.create()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Archiver instance using the default configuration, which may be different from the configuration used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Archiver.create(compression: Compression.Store)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Archiver instance with a different compression algorithm, which may result in different compressed data.

DONE.
