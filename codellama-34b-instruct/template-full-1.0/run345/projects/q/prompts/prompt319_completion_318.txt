  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
descriptor[op]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the function stored in the `descriptor[op]` property, which may be different from the `descriptor[op]` property itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
descriptor[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the `descriptor[op]` property with the `args` arguments, which may produce different results than returning the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
op(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function stored in the `op` property with the `args` arguments, which may produce different results than returning the function stored in the `descriptor[op]` property.

DONE.
