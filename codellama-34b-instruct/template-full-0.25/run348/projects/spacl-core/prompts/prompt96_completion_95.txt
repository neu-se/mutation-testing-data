  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used as the policy instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for all policies, even if they have a matching path and verb.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the policy instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for all policies, even if they have a matching path and verb.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new policy object would be created and used as the policy, which would cause the `query` method to return a different result than the original code, even if the policy name and path match.

DONE.
