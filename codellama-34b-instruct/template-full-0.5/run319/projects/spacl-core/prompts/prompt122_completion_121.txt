  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would be called on the `path` variable, but the return value would be `null` instead of a `Matcher` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would be called on the `path` variable with the string argument `'foo'`, but the return value would be `null` instead of a `Matcher` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(new RegExp('foo'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would be called on the `path` variable with a new `RegExp` object as an argument, but the return value would be `null` instead of a `Matcher` object.

DONE.
