  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while this code only checks if `this` is infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` even if `z` is not infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this code only checks if `this` is infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` even if `z` is not infinite, which is not the intended behavior.
