  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false && opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `final` variable is now always false, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to true. This would cause the program to enter the `if` block and execute the `throw` statement, regardless of the value of the `opt` and `min` variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true || opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` constant is now always true, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to true. This would cause the program to enter the `if` block and execute the `throw` statement, regardless of the value of the `opt` and `min` variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(opt < 1) ? (min < 1) : (false && opt && min < 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opt
