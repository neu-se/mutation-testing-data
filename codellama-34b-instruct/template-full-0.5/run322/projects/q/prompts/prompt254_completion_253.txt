  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `message[0]` is the first element of the `message` array, while `message` is the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(1)` returns a new array with all elements except the first one, while `message` is the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `message` array, while `message` is the entire array.

DONE.
