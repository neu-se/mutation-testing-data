  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called instead of `fulfill`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called with a different value than the original code, which would cause the promise to be resolved to a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called with the same value as the original code, but it is called twice, which would cause the promise to be resolved twice, which is not allowed.

DONE.
