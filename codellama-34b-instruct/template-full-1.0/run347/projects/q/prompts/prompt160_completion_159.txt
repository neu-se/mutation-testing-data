  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: null, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `stack` property to the `stack` property of the error object, while this fragment sets it to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: undefined, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `stack` property to the `stack` property of the error object, while this fragment sets it to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: promise.stack, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the `stack` property to the concatenation of the `stack` property of the error object and the `stack` property of the promise, while this fragment sets it to only the `stack` property of the promise.

DONE.
