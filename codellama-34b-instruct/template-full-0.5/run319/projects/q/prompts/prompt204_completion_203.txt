  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would return a different value than the original code fragment, which was:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1].split(":")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would return a different string value than the original code fragment, which was:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substr(stackLine.indexOf("@") + 1).split(":")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would return a different string value than the original code fragment, which was:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```

DONE.
