  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones.bind(null, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return all timezones, including deprecated ones, regardless of the `deprecated` option passed to the `getAllTimezones` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones.bind(null, { deprecated: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return only non-deprecated timezones, regardless of the `deprecated` option passed to the `getAllTimezones` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones.bind(null, { deprecated: !options.deprecated })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return timezones with the opposite `deprecated` status of what was passed to the `getAllTimezones` function.

DONE.
