  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first 10 characters of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first line of the stack trace, rather than the entire stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace(/^.*\n/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first line of the stack trace, rather than returning the entire stack trace.

DONE.
