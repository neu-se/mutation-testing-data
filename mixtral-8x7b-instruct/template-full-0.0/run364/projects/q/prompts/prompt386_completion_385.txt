 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is not being called, and the callback function would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not passing the correct context (`this` value) to the callback function, which could cause issues if the callback function relies on the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being used to create a new function with a specific context, but it is not being passed any arguments, so if the callback function expects arguments, it would not receive them.

DONE.
