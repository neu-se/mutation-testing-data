  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the portion of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number information that is being searched for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack trace, which may not include the file name and line number information that is being searched for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first colon-separated field of the stack trace, which may not include the file name and line number information that is being searched for.

DONE.
