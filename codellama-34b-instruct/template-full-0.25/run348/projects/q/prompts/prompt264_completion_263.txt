  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` will cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(undefined)` will cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(value + 1)` will cause the promise to be resolved with the value `value + 1`, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value `value`.

DONE.
