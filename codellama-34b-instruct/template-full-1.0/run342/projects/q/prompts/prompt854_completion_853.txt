  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the clearTimeout function would be called with null as the first argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the clearTimeout function would not be able to clear the timeout, as the value of timeoutId is not a reference to a timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {}, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the clearTimeout function would not be able to clear the timeout, as the value of timeoutId is not a reference to a timeout.

DONE.
