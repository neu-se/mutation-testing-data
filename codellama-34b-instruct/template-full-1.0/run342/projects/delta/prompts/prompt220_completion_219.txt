  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `.insert` can be a non-null value that is not a string, resulting in a false positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `.insert` can be a non-null value that is not a string, resulting in a false positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined || typeof op.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for a `null` or `undefined` value in `.insert`, whereas the original code fragment does not.

DONE.
