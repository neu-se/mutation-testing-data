  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `aborted` value, which is a non-null value, while the new code fragment returns `null`, which is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `aborted` value, which is a non-null value, while the new code fragment returns `undefined`, which is a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `aborted` value, which is a non-null value, while the new code fragment returns the number `1`, which is a non-null value.

DONE.
