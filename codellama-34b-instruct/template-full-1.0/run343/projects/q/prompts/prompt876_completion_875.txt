  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` returns an array, but `array_slice()[0]` returns the first element of the array, which may not be the same as the original code's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice()[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` returns an array, but `array_slice()[1]` returns the second element of the array, which may not be the same as the original code's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice()[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice()` returns an array, but `array_slice()[2]` returns the third element of the array, which may not be the same as the original code's behavior.

DONE.
