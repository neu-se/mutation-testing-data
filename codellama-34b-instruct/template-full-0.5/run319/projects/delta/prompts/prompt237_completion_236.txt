  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the opLength, which would cause the code to retain one more character than it should, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the opLength, which would cause the code to retain one fewer character than it should, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be doubling the opLength, which would cause the code to retain twice as many characters as it should, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
