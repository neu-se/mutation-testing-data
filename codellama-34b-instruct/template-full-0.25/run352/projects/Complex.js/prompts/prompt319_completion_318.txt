  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not the same. In particular, `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, while `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, which is related to `sinh` and `cosh` but has a different shape.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sech
```
This would result in different behavior because `sech` is the hyperbolic secant function, which is related to `sinh` and `cosh` but has a different shape.

DONE.
