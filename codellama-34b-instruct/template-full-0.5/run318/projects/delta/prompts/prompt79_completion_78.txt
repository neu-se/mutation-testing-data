  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number, while this replacement only checks if it is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.insert` is not null, while this replacement only checks if it is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number, while this replacement only checks if it is less than 0.

DONE.
