  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the base URL string to lowercase, which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the URL contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the base URL string, which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the URL contains characters that are not valid in the reversed order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the `http://` protocol with `https://`, which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the URL does not support HTTPS.

DONE.
