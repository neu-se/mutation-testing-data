  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This change will cause the `sink` function to always return `true` when the `abort` variable is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This change will cause the `sink` function to always return `false` when the `abort` variable is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This change will cause the `sink` function to always return `true` when the `abort` variable is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
