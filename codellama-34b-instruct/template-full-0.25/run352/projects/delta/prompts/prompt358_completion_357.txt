  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which flips the boolean value of the `priority` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `priority` variable, which could change the behavior of the code that uses the `priority` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the `priority` variable by 2, which could change the behavior of the code that uses the `priority` variable.

DONE.
