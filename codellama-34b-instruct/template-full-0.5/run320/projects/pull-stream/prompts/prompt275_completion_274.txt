  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `stream`, which would likely cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `stream`, which would likely cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `stream` by 2, which would likely cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
