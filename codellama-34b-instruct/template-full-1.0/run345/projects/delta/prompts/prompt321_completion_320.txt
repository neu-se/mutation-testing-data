  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
op.delete !== true
```

This would result in different behavior because the original line `op.delete || typeof op.retain` is testing whether `op.delete` is a non-`null` value _or_ whether the value of `op.retain` is a number, while replacing it with `op.delete !== true` only tests whether `op.delete` is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
op.delete || (<PLACEHOLDER>)
```

This would result in different behavior because the original line `op.delete || typeof op.retain` is only testing `op.delete` for non-`null` values, while replacing it with `(<PLACEHOLDER>)` allows for the possibility of `op.delete` having a different type of value that could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
(op.delete + op.ret
