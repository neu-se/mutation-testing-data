  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the stack trace to be printed in reverse order, which could make it more difficult to understand the flow of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method would remove the first element of the array, which could cause the stack trace to be incomplete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").filter(function(line) { return line.indexOf("at ") === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would remove any lines that do not start with the string "at ", which could cause the stack trace to be incomplete.

DONE.
