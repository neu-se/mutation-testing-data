  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next element in the iterator, whereas `next` without parentheses returns a reference to the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
slice.ops.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice.ops` is an array, and `array.next()` is not a valid method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops` is a property of the `Delta` class, and `ops.next()` is not a valid method.

DONE.
