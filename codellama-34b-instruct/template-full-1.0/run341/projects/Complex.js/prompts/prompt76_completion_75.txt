  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition of the loop would be executed one more time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error on the `tokens` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition of the loop would never be met, and the loop would never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition of the loop would be met only if `i` is not equal to `tokens.length`, which is not the intended behavior of a loop that iterates over the entire `tokens` array.

DONE.
