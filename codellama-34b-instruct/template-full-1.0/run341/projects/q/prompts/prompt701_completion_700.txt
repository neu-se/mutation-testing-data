  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3-Math.abs(3/4)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an array of all arguments, while this replacement code fragment would return an array of the arguments from argument 3 onwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reverse()[promise].length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an array of all arguments, while this replacement code fragment would return an array of the arguments in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error &&error.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an array of all arguments, while this replacement code fragment would return an array of all arguments and errors.

DONE.
