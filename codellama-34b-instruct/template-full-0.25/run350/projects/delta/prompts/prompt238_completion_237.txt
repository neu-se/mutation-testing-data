  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of its arguments, while `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the string, which would cause the `indexOf` method to search for the newline character in the wrong position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `indexOf` method to search for the newline character starting from the beginning of the string, rather than starting from the current position.

DONE.
