  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `b`. This change would cause the `logHypot` function to receive a different input, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `a` is a different variable. This change would cause the `logHypot` function to receive a different input, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `Math.PI` is a constant. This change would cause the `logHypot` function to receive a different input, potentially resulting in a different output.

DONE.
