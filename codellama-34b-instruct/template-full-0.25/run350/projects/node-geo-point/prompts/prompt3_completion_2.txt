  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `longitude === 0` would cause the code to throw a `RangeError` if the `longitude` argument is 0, even if it is within the valid range of -180 to 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || longitude === 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `longitude === 180` would cause the code to throw a `RangeError` if the `longitude` argument is 180, even if it is within the valid range of -180 to 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || longitude === 90
```
