  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, but the original code does not use `bind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes a function with a specific context, but the original code does not use `call`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes a function with a specific context and arguments, but the original code does not use `apply`.

DONE.
