  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, and would iterate one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, and would not check the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i >= this.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, and would check the first element of the array instead of the last.

DONE.
