  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would remove the first element of the `args` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `callback.apply(self, args)` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([null])` would add a `null` value to the end of the `args` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `callback.apply(self, args)` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` would increment each element of the `args` array by 1, which could potentially change the behavior of the `callback.apply(self, args)` call.
