  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!href || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the "!" operator would negate the condition, causing the if statement to always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of href.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href != "undefined" || (href.length < 3 && !/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href))
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length < 4 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would
