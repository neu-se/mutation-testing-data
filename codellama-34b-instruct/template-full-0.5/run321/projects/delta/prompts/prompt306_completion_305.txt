  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would be incremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate one more time than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would be decremented by 1, which would cause the loop to iterate one less time than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would be doubled, which would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times as intended.

DONE.
