  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the original promise returned by `Q(object).npost(name, args)`, which could lead to unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise returned by `Q(object).npost(name, args)`, which could lead to unhandled errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost(name, args).then(function (result) {
    deferred.resolve(result);
}, function (error) {
    deferred.reject(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
