  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `Q(null)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, whereas `Q(value)` would return a promise that is pending until the value of `value` is known.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `Q(undefined)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, whereas `Q(value)` would return a promise that is pending until the value of `value` is known.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value, and `Q(0)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `0`, whereas `Q(value)` would return a promise that is pending until the value of `value` is known.

DONE.
