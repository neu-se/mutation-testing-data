  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this code fragment is subtracting 1. This would cause the generated plural form of words ending in "us" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting 2 from the length of the word, while this code fragment is subtracting 3. This would cause the generated plural form of words ending in "us" to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is starting from the beginning of the word and subtracting 2 from the length, while this code fragment is starting from the second character of the word and subtracting 1 from the length. This would cause the
