 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks for strict equality, whereas the original code uses the `isEqual` function which might handle type coercion or deep equality for complex objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert == otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for loose equality, which can lead to unexpected results due to type coercion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.is(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.is` checks for strict equality like the `===` operator, but also treats `-0` and `+0` as well as `NaN` as equal, unlike the `===` operator.

DONE.
