  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((accum, curr) => accum + curr.length, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the total length of the ops array by summing up the length of each op, rather than the original code which calculates the total length by summing up the retain and delete properties of each op.
