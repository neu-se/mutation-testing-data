  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method that returns a promise for an array of the resolved values of all the promises in the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anyResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `anyResolved` is a different method that returns a promise for the first resolved promise in the input array, or a rejected promise if all promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method that returns a promise for an array of the states (as returned by `inspect`) when all promises have settled.

DONE.
