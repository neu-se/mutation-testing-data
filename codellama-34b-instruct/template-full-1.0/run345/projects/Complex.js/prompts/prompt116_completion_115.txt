  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are not necessarily the same as the input values `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the addition operation is different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation is replaced with a subtraction operation.

DONE.
