  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is not used, which means that the code would not check if `a` is an object, but rather if `a` is equal to the string `'object'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object` constructor is used instead of the `typeof` operator, which means that the code would not check if `a` is an object, but rather if `a` is equal to the `Object` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object' && typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if `a` is not an object, but also checks if `a` is not a function. This would be different from the original code, which only checked if `a` is not an object.
