 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` takes two arguments (y, x) to calculate the angle in radians of the point (x, y) relative to the origin in a 2D plane, while `Math.atan` only takes one argument and calculates the angle in radians of a given y coordinate relative to the x-axis.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2.bind(null, 1)` always passes 1 as the first argument (y), regardless of the input value, while `Math.atan2` takes two arguments (y, x) to calculate the angle in radians of the point (x, y) relative to the origin in a 2D plane.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(this.
