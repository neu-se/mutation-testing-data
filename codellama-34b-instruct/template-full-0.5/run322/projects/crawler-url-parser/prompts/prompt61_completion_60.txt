  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object, whereas `URL.format` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL against a base URL, whereas `URL.format` returns a string representation of a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.searchParams
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.searchParams` returns a URLSearchParams object, whereas `URL.format` returns a string.

DONE.
