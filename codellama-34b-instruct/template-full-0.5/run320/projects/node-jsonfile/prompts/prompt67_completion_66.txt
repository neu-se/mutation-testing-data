  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string with a single space character, rather than an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string with a null value, rather than an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string with an undefined value, rather than an empty string.

DONE.
