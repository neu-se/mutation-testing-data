  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `domain` variable, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would short-circuit the evaluation of the expression and always return `false`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would short-circuit the evaluation of the expression and always return `true`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

DONE.
