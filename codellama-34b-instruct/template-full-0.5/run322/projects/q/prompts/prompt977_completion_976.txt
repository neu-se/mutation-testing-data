  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `function(){}` is an empty function that does not have the same behavior as the `defer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function(err){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `function(err){}` is a function that takes an error parameter, which is not the same as the `defer` function.

DONE.
