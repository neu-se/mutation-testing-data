  Sure, here are three possible code fragments that could be used as a buggy replacement for the `true` constant in the `once` function:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false`, even if `value` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if `value` is not null, regardless of whether `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` if `value` is falsy, regardless of whether `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
