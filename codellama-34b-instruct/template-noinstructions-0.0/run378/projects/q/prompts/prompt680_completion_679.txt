  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would skip the first argument to `Q.try` and return an array of only the remaining arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `0`, which would return an empty array, and the third argument is `1`, which would limit the number of elements returned to only the first argument to `Q.try`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `1`, which would skip the first argument to `Q.try`, and the third
