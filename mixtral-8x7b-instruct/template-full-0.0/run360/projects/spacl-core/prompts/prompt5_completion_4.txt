 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `spec` starts with a valid character, instead of checking if the entire `spec` contains only valid characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `spec` does not start with a slash, instead of checking if it starts with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `spec` contains two forward slashes next to each other, instead of checking if it contains empty segments.

DONE.
