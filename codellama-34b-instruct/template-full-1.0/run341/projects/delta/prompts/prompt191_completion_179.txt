  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The resulting code would throw an error if `delta.push(newOp)` was called, as `newOp` would no longer be valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The resulting code would throw an error if `delta.push(newOp)` was called, as `newOp` would no longer be valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp` is an object, but `0` is a number. The resulting code would throw an error if `delta.push(newOp)` was called, as `newOp` would no longer be valid.

DONE.
