  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different group in the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the entire regex, not just a group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$3'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different group in the regex.

DONE.
