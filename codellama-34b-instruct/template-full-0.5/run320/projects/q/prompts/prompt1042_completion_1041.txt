  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise for a value, whereas `get` is a method that returns a promise for an object with a `head` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a promise for a value, whereas `get` is a method that returns a promise for an object with a `head` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that returns a promise for a value, whereas `get` is a method that returns a promise for an object with a `head` property.

DONE.
