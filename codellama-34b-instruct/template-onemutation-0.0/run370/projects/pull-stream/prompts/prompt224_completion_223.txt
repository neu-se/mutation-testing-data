  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would invert the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should.

DONE.
