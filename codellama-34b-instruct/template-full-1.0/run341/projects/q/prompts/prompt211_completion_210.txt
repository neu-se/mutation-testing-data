  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arguments` object as a single argument, instead of passing each argument separately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `callback` function to `null` and pass in the `arguments` object as a single argument, instead of passing each argument separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return callback.apply(null, arguments) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new function that applies the `callback` function to `null` and passes in the `arguments` object as a single argument, instead of passing each argument separately.

DONE.
