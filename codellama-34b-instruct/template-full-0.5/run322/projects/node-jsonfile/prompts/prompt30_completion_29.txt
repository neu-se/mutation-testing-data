  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"obj"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but the replacement code fragment `"obj"` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but the replacement code fragment `obj.length` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but the replacement code fragment `obj[0]` is a string.

DONE.
