  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `a` is a given constant or variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is a different constant or variable than `a`, and could potentially result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different constant or variable than `a`, and could potentially result in a different output.

DONE.
