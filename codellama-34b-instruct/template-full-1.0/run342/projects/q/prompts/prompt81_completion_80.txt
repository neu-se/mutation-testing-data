  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `laterQueue` will always have a length of at least 1, which could cause the `flush` function to be called more frequently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `laterQueue` will always have a length of at least 1, which could cause the `flush` function to be called more frequently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `laterQueue` will always be empty, which could cause the `flush` function to never be called.

DONE.
