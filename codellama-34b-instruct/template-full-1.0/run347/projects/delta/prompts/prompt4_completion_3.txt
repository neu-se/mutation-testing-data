  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` refers to the first argument passed to the `compose` function, while `b` refers to the second argument. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the `compose` function to always return the first argument, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `compose` function's second argument, and it would throw a type error when attempting to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `compose` function's second argument, and it would throw a type error when attempting to access it.

DONE.
