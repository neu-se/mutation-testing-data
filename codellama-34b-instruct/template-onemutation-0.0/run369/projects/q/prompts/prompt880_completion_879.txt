  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to a function, while the replaced code fragment is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a callback.
