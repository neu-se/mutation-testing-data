Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would return `null` instead of an object containing the state and reason, leading to a loss of information about the promise's rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would return `undefined`, which is not a valid return type for the inspection of a promise, potentially causing errors in any code that expects an object with state and reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function would return a string instead of an object, which would not provide the necessary details about the promise's state and reason, leading to incorrect handling of the promise's rejection.

DONE.
