  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but `read + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but `read.source` is a property of the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function, but `read.source()` is the result of calling the `source` method on the `read` function.

DONE.
