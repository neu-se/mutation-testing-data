  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, "unknown"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter would be replaced with the string "unknown", which would cause the `getCountry` function to return null instead of a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter would be incremented by 100, which could cause the `getCountry` function to return a country that is not in the `data` object.

DONE.
