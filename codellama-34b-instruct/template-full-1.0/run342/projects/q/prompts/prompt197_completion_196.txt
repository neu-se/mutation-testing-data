  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the string at the first colon, which could cause issues if there are multiple colons in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(0, stackLine.lastIndexOf(":"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the substring up to the last colon, which could cause issues if there are other colons in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/^.*?:/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the portion of the string up to and including the first colon, which could cause issues if there are other colons in the string.

DONE.
