  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `tap` method to be called with a `null` value, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `tap` method to be called with an `undefined` value, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `tap` method to be called with a value of `0`, which would likely cause the `tap` method to behave differently than it would with the original value.

DONE.
