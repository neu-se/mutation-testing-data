  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the third operand instead of the second, which could lead to unexpected results if the operands are not what was expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second operand is falsy instead of truthy, which could lead to unexpected results if the operands are not what was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[1] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second operand is 0 instead of truthy, which could lead to unexpected results if the operands are not what was expected.

DONE.
