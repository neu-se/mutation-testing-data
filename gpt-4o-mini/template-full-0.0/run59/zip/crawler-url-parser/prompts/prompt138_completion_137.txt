Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the global flag `g` would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the first one, potentially leading to unexpected results when processing URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the case-insensitive flag `i` would allow the regex to match "default" regardless of its case (e.g., "Default", "DEFAULT"), which could lead to incorrect URL processing if the casing is inconsistent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiline flag `m` would change how the `^` and `$` anchors work, allowing them to match the start and end of each line within a string, which could lead to incorrect matches if the input string contains newline characters.

DONE.
