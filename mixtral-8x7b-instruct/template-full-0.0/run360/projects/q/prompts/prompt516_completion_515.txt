 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promise['then']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the bracket notation instead of the dot notation, which might not work as expected if the `promise` object has a property with the name "then" but not the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.prototype.then.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls the `then` method from the prototype of the Promise object, which might not work as expected if the `promise` object is not an instance of Promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 0, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `deferred.resolve` call in a `setTimeout` function with a delay of 0, which might not work as expected because it schedules the `deferred.resolve` call to be executed in the next
