  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create()
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create()` creates a new archiver instance, while `archiver` is a reference to the existing archiver instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.finalize()
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.finalize()` finalizes the archiver instance, while `archiver` is a reference to the existing archiver instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.pipe()
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.pipe()` pipes the archiver instance to a writable stream, while `archiver` is a reference to the existing archiver instance.

DONE.
