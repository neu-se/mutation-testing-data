  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `op` function to return a truthy value, but `null` is falsy, so the `op` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `op` function to return a truthy value, but `undefined` is falsy, so the `op` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `op` function to return a truthy value, but `NaN` is falsy, so the `op` function would not be called.

DONE.
