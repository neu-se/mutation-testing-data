  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insertion, while this code fragment checks if it is a deletion. This could cause the algorithm to produce a different output, as the behavior of the algorithm would be different when handling insertions and deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insertion, while this code fragment checks if it is a retention. This could cause the algorithm to produce a different output, as the behavior of the algorithm would be different when handling insertions and retentions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior
