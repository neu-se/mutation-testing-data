  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of the expected `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` if the URL has a protocol, instead of the expected `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` if the URL has a host, instead of the expected `true`.

DONE.
