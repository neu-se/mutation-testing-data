  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert()` would invert the `base` object, whereas `base` itself is not inverted in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(attr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(attr)` would invert the `base` object with respect to the `attr` object, whereas `base` itself is not inverted in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(attr, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(attr, priority)` would invert the `base` object with respect to the `attr` object and the `priority` flag, whereas `base` itself is not inverted in the original code fragment.

DONE.
