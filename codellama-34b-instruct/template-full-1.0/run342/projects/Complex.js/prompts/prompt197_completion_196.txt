  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number, which would cause the computed result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would cause the computed result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] / z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the real part, which would cause the computed result to be incorrect.

DONE.
