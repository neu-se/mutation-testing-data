  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This change will cause the `get` method to always return the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object, rather than the `tail` property as intended. This will result in the `get` method always returning the same value, rather than the next value in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" + "1"
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, but with a `1` appended to the end. This will result in the `get` method returning a different value than intended, and may cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail" - 1
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, but with a `-1` subtracted from the end. This will result in
