  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` and `fulfill` are different functions that handle the resolution of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are different functions that handle the resolution of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is used to create a new promise and `reject` is used to reject a promise.

DONE.
