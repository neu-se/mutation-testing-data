 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'persons', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would incorrectly treat the singular form "person" as the plural form "persons".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would incorrectly treat the plural form "people" as a different singular form "peoples".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'person', function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always append "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a singular or plural form.

DONE.
