  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the length of the peeked operation by 1, potentially causing the loop to overshoot the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the length of the peeked operation by 1, potentially causing the loop to undershoot the length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing the loop to jump over the entire operation.

DONE.
