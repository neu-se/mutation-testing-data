  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `post` method to dispatch the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments, while the modified code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to dispatch the `name` and `nodeArgs` arguments. The `post` method is a method of the `Q` object, while the `dispatch` method is a method of the `Promise.prototype` object.

DONE.
