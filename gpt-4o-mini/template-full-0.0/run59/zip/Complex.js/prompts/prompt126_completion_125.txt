Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which could lead to incorrect results when adding an infinite complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass if the number is not infinite, potentially allowing for incorrect handling of infinite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the second complex number `z` is infinite instead of the current instance, which could lead to incorrect results when the first complex number is infinite but the second is not.

DONE.
