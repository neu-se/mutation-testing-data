  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for the `ENOENT` error code, while this replacement checks for both `ENOENT` and `EACCES`. If the error code is `EACCES`, the original code would not have caught it, but this replacement would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' && err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for either `ENOENT` or `EACCES`, while this replacement checks for both. If the error code is `ENOENT`, the original code would catch it, but this replacement would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'EACCES' || err.code === 'EPERM'
