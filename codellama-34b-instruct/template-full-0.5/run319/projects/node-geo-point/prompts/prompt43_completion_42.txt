  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which could result in a different distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude of the second point, which could result in a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude of the second point by 2, which could result in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
