  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This change will cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
