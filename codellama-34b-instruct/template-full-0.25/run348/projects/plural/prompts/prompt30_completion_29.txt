  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the third "thesis" would match the regular expression, causing the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the third "crisis" would match the regular expression, causing the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the third and fourth "thesis" and "crisis" would match the regular expression, causing the function to return a different result.

DONE.
