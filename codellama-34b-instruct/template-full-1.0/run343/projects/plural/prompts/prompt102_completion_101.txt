  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/gi.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gi` flag is not used in the original code fragment, and it would cause the regular expression to match case-insensitively and match all occurrences in the input string, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b\$\i/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$` character is not escaped in the original code fragment, and it would cause the regular expression to match the end of the input string, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b
