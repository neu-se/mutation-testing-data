  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` would consume the response data, freeing up memory, but it would also cause the request to be aborted, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy()` would destroy the response object, causing the request to fail and the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.socket.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.socket.destroy()` would destroy the underlying socket, causing the request to fail and the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
