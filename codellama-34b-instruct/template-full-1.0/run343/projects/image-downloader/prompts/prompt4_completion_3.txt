  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is checked for truthiness, whereas the original code fragment checked `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options.dest === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different type check, and would only evaluate to true if `options.dest` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to true if `options.dest` is falsy or missing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the `options.dest` string, whereas the original code fragment checked the truthiness of `options.dest`.

DONE.
