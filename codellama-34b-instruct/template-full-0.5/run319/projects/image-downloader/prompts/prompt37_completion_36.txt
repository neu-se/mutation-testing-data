  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'`, which appends to the file instead of overwriting it. This could cause the download to fail if the file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which overwrites the file if it already exists. This could cause the download to fail if the file is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'wx' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'wx'`, which creates a new file if it does not already exist. This could cause the download to fail if the file already exists.

DONE.
