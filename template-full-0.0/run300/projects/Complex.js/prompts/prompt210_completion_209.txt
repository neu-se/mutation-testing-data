  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to use the wrong value for the `y` coordinate, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to use the sum of the `x` and `y` coordinates as the `y` coordinate, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `atan2` function to use the difference of the `x` and `y` coordinates as the `y` coordinate, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's argument.

DONE.
