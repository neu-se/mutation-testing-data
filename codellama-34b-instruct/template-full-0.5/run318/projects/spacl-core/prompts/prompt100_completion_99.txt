  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `path` string to lowercase, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the number of characters in the `path` string, which may not be relevant to the logic of the `query` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace('/', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove any forward slashes from the `path` string, which may not be desirable in all cases.

DONE.
