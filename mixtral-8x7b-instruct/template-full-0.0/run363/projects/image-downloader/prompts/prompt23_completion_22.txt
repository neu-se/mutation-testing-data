 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the destination path relative to the current file instead of the module's root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the destination path relative to the current working directory, which might not be the same as the module's root directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { /* empty arrow function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `__dirname` value with an empty function, which would cause the `path.resolve()` method to throw an error.

By introducing these changes, you can test the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior caused by changes in the destination path resolution. DONE.
