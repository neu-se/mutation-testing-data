  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `terminate` is a function that takes two arguments, but `cb` is only a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with the arguments `null` and `data`, but the original code calls `cb` with the arguments `ended` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with the arguments `null` and `data`, but the original code calls `cb` with the arguments `ended` and `data`.

DONE.
