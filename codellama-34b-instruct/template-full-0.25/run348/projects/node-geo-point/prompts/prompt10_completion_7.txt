  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `hasOwnProperty` method, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of whether the `point` object has the `coordinates` property or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called with the `coordinates` property name as an argument, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if the `point` object has the `coordinates` property and it is not inherited from its prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called with the `
