  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `true` as the argument would cause the function to be called with a different value than it was originally called with.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `false` as the argument would cause the function to be called with a different value than it was originally called with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes an argument, and passing `null` as the argument would cause the function to be called with a different value than it was originally called with.

DONE.
