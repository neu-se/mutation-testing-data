  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value stored at the key with an empty string instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the value stored at a different key than the one that was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the value stored at the key but would also return -1 instead of 0, which could cause problems in some edge cases.
