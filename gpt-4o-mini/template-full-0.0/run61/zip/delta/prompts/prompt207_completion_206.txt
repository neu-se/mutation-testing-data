Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation from `thisIter` instead of the operation from `otherIter`, potentially altering the composition of the delta and leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push an operation that has a retain value incremented by 1, which could lead to an incorrect representation of the operations in the delta, as it modifies the retain count unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a null value instead of a valid operation, which could cause the delta to be malformed or lead to runtime errors when processing the delta later on.

DONE.
