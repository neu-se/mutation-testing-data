  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push("(no stack) " + reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a string with the reason and the string "(no stack)" to the array, whereas the original code would push only the reason to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason + " (no stack)");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a string with the reason and the string "(no stack)" to the array, whereas the original code would push only the reason to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.push(reason.stack + " (no stack)");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a string with the reason's stack trace and the string "(no stack)" to the array, whereas the original code would push only the reason to the array.

DONE.
