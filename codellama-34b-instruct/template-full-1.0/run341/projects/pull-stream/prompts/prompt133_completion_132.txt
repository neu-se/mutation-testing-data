  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function would be called instead of the `cb` function, which could cause the stream to abort unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so calling it as a function would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a value that the `cb` function can handle, so it would cause an error.

DONE.
