  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the original `ends` deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given error, whereas `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` rejects the promise with the given error, whereas `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object.

DONE.
