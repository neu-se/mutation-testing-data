  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.path` is a string, while `linkurl` is an object with properties such as `url`, `text`, and `type`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.url` is a string, while `linkurl` is an object with properties such as `url`, `text`, and `type`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.text
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.text` is a string, while `linkurl` is an object with properties such as `url`, `text`, and `type`.

DONE.
