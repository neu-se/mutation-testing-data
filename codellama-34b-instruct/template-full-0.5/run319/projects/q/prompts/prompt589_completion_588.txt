  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function, and `Q.async.bind(this)` would return a bound function, which would not be equivalent to `Q.async`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function, and `Q.async.call(this)` would call the function with `this` as the context, which would not be equivalent to `Q.async`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function, and `Q.async.apply(this)` would call the function with `this` as the context and an empty argument list, which would not be equivalent to `Q.async`.

DONE.
