  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.concat(tzs[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev.concat(tzs[key])` would add the timezone to the end of the `prev` array, whereas `prev` would only add the timezone if it was not already present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.filter(tz => tz.name !== tzs[key].name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev.filter(tz => tz.name !== tzs[key].name)` would remove any timezones from the `prev` array that have the same name as the timezone being added, whereas `prev` would only add the timezone if it was not already present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.slice(0, tzs[key].length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prev.slice(0, tzs[key].length)` would only
