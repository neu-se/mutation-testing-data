  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` prototype, not the `Q` object, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the `object` as the `this` value, rather than the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method of the `Function` prototype, not the `Q` object, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the `object` as the `this` value, rather than the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method of the `Function` prototype, not the `Q` object, and it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the `object
