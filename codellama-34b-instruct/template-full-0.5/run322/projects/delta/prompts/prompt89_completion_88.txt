  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `newOp.attributes` is `null`, even though it is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `newOp.attributes` is `undefined`, even though it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `newOp.attributes` is an instance of `Object`, which is not necessarily the same as being an object.

DONE.
