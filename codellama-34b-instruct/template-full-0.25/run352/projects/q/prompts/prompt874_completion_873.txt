  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `function() {}` is not a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(Q.defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function expects a function as its argument, but `Q.defer()` is not a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
