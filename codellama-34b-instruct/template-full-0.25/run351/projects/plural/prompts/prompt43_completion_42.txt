  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always remove one character from the input word, regardless of whether it ends in "us" or "i".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always add one character to the input word, regardless of whether it ends in "us" or "i".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always double the length of the input word, regardless of whether it ends in "us" or "i".

DONE.
