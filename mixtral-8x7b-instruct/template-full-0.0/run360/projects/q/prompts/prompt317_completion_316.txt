 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable would be assigned the value `null` instead of an instance of `Promise.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(descriptor)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` and `inspect` arguments would not be passed to the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(descriptor, fallback, inspect).promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be assigned directly to `promise` instead of being a method of the `Promise.prototype`.

DONE.
