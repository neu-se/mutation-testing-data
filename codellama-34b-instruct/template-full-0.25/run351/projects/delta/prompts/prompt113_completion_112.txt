  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum the values of the `ops` array instead of reducing it to a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the values of the `ops` array instead of reducing it to a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of the `ops` array instead of reducing it to a single value.

DONE.
