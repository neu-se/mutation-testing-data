Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `null` instead of using the original condition that checks for falsiness, which would allow other falsy values (like `undefined` or `0`) to pass through incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an empty array, which would not account for the case where `fileNameAndLineNumber` is `undefined` or `null`, potentially leading to a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for `undefined`, which would allow `null` values to be treated as valid, thus bypassing the intended filtering logic.

DONE.
