  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a function that is called with the `progressed` argument, which is used to notify the progress of the promise. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to be called with `null` instead, which would likely result in an error.

This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a function that is called with the `progressed` argument, which is used to notify the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is a function that is called with the `progressed` argument, which is used to notify the progress of the promise. Replacing it with `Q.reject` would cause
