  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code to execute the `try` block when `hasStacks` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks && !isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `try` block when `hasStacks` is `false` and `isNodeFrame(stackLine)` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks || isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `try` block when `hasStacks` is `true` or `isNodeFrame(stackLine)` is `true`.

DONE.
