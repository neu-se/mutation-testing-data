  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise with the exception object, while this new code fragment rejects the promise with a new error object that includes the operation name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise with the exception object, while this new code fragment throws a new error object that includes the operation name.

DONE.
