  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called on the `writeStream` object, which would close the stream and emit an `error` event, rather than the expected `drain` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called on the `writeStream` object, which would close the stream and emit an `end` event, rather than the expected `drain` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called on the `writeStream` object, which would close the stream and emit a `finish` event, rather than the expected `drain` event.

DONE.
