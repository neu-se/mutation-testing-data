  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `attributes.length` would return the number of keys in the `attributes` object, while `attributes` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(attributes).length` would return the number of keys in the `attributes` object, while `attributes` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(attributes).length` would return the number of values in the `attributes` object, while `attributes` would return the object itself.

DONE.
