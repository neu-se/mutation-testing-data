  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback if it is defined, whereas this new code fragment would call the callback regardless of whether it is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Callback not defined'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback if it is defined, whereas this new code fragment would call the callback and pass an error message if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Callback not defined'), val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback if it is defined, whereas this new code fragment would call the callback and pass an error message and the value of the key if it is not defined.

DONE.
