  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection.stack` property is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection.message` property is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection.reason` property is not defined in the original code, but it is defined in the buggy code fragment.

DONE.
