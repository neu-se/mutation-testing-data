Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with the original exception, it would resolve with `null`, potentially masking the error and leading to incorrect program flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject with a string message instead of the original exception object, which could lead to loss of stack trace information and make debugging more difficult.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject with `undefined`, which may not provide any useful information about the error, making it harder for the calling code to handle the rejection appropriately.

DONE.
