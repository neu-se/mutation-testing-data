  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is pending until it is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise if the object is not a promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending until it is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a function that applies the provided function to the provided arguments in a future turn, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is pending until it is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
