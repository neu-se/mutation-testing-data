  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekLength < length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the loop and cause the loop to end earlier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekLength > length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the loop and cause the loop to end later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekLength != length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the loop and cause the loop to end at a different point.

DONE.
