  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the value of the `insert` property of `otherOp`, which may not be the same as the value of `otherOp` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the value of the `delete` property of `otherOp`, which may not be the same as the value of `otherOp` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the value of the `retain` property of `otherOp`, which may not be the same as the value of `otherOp` itself.

DONE.
