  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `field` variable, potentially causing the `filter` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would change the value of the `field` variable, potentially causing the `filter` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would change the value of the `field` variable, potentially causing the `filter` function to return a different result.

DONE.
