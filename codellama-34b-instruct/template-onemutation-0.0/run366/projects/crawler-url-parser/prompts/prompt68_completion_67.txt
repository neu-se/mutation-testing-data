  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` parameter as the base URL for parsing, while the modified code always uses "http://example.com" as the base URL. This could cause the extracted URLs to be different in some cases.

DONE.
