  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length >= 1 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `>` instead of `>=`, which would result in the regex matcher not matching a string that contains a single forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `>` instead of `>=` which would result in the regex matcher not matching a string that contains a empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also checks for the length of the string, and this modified code fragment would match strings of any length, not just those greater than 1.

DONE.
