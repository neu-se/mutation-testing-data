  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be increased by 1, which could cause the program to access an index out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be decreased by 1, which could cause the program to skip over a character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would be doubled, which could cause the program to access an index that is outside the bounds of the string.

DONE.
