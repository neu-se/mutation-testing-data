  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be set to `true`, causing the `while` loop to exit immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be set to `false`, causing the `while` loop to continue running indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be set to `null`, causing the `while` loop to continue running indefinitely.

DONE.
