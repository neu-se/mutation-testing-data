  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not exit the parser with an error code, while the mutated code would exit the parser with an error code of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would exit the parser with an error code of 1, while the mutated code would exit the parser with an error code of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would exit the parser with an error code of 1, while the mutated code would exit the parser with an error code of 2.

DONE.
