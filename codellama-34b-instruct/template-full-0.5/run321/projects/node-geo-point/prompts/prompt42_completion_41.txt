  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which would return a different value than `sin` for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 - sin` is the complement of the sine function, which would return a different value than `sin` for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(x + 1)` is the sine of a different angle than `sin(x)`, which would return a different value than `sin` for the same input.

DONE.
