  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current URL instead of the base URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the href property of the parsed base URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL string instead of the parsed base URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
