  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` and `Math.round` have different rounding mechanics, with the former returning the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, and the latter returning the integer closest to a given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` and `Math.round` have different rounding mechanics, with the former returning the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number, and the latter returning the integer closest to a given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(<expression>, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` converts a string to an integer, while `Math.round` rounds a number to the nearest integer.

DONE.
