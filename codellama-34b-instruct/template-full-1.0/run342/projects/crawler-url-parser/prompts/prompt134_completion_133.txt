  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default\.[a-z-]+$/,'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to include a hyphen in the character class, whereas the original pattern does not include a hyphen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default\.[a-z]+$/,' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to match a space character at the end of the string, whereas the original pattern does not match any space characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default\.[a-z-]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern has been modified to include a hyphen in the character class, whereas the original pattern does not include a hyphen. Additionally, the replacement string has been removed, so the matched substring will be replaced with an empty string.

DONE.
