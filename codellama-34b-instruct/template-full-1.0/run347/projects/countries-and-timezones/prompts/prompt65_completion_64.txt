  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country from the one intended, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country code, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] % 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country code, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Please note that the above code snippets are for illustration purposes only and may not be appropriate for the specific use case. It's important to test and analyze the impact of any changes made to the code in a controlled and thoughtful manner.

DONE.
