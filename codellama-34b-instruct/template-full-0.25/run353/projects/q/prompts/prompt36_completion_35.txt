  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a boolean variable that is true when the code is running in a Node.js environment, and false otherwise. By negating it, the code would behave as if it were running in a browser environment, even if it is actually running in Node.js.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a boolean variable that is true when the code is running in a Node.js environment, and false otherwise. By adding `&& false`, the code would behave as if it were running in a browser environment, even if it is actually running in Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeJS` is a boolean variable that is true when the code is running in a Node.js environment, and false otherwise. By adding
