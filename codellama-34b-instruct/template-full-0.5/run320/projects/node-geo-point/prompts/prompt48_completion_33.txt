  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `deg2rad` expects a value in degrees, but `φ2` is already in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `rad2deg` expects a value in radians, but `φ2` is already in degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is a value in degrees, and the multiplication by `Math.PI / 180` converts it to radians.

DONE.
