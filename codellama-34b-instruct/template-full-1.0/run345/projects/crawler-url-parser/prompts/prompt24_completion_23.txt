  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*\/#/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/i` modifier is removed, so the replacement pattern would match only at the beginning of the string, rather than anywhere in the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/i` modifier is added, so the replacement pattern would match case-insensitively, and the `^` anchor is removed, so the replacement pattern would match anywhere in the input rather than only at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[^#]+(?=#)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern uses a positive lookahead assertion to match any non-`#` characters followed by a `#`, rather than matching any characters and then matching the `#`.

DONE.
