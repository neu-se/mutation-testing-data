  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` object is not null and has at least one key, while the new code fragment only checks if the `attributes` object is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` object is not null and has at least one key, while the new code fragment only checks if the `attributes` object is not null and has no keys.
