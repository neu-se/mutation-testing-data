  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => console.log(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.forEach` would log each operation in the `ops` array to the console, while the original code fragment `this.ops.forEach` would iterate over each operation and apply the `predicate` function to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.delete > 0).forEach(op => console.log(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.filter(op => op.delete > 0)` would filter the `ops` array to only include operations with a non-zero `delete` property, while the original code fragment `this.ops.forEach` would iterate over all operations in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 10).forEach(op => console.log(op));
