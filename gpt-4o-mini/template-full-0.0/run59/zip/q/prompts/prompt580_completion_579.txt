Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to always treat the verb as "next", ignoring the actual verb passed to it, which would prevent the generator from handling exceptions correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `errback` function to be undefined, leading to a runtime error when an exception is thrown in the generator, as there would be no function to handle the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throwError"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the verb to a non-existent operation, causing the generator to fail to handle the thrown exceptions properly, resulting in unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
