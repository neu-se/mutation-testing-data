  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.fromCharCode()` method expects a Unicode code point as its argument, not a number. In this case, `String.fromCharCode(1)` would return the string "1", which is not the same as the string "0" that the original code fragment returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.fromCharCode()` method expects a Unicode code point as its argument, not a string. In this case, `String.fromCharCode("a")` would return the string "a", which is not the same as the string "0" that the original code fragment returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.fromCharCode()` method expects a Unicode code point as its argument, not a string. In this case, `String.fromCharCode("0
