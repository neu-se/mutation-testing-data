  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string 'type' with the string 'Point', resulting in the string 'typePoint', which is not a valid property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the string 'type' by 2, resulting in the string 'type type', which is not a valid property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string 'type' with the number 1, resulting in the string 'type1', which is not a valid property name.

DONE.
