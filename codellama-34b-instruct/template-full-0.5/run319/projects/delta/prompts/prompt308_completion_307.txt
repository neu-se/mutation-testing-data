  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with an empty attributes object, which may cause it to behave differently than when it was called with the original attributes object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with `null` as the attributes object, which may cause it to behave differently than when it was called with the original attributes object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { foo: 'bar' }, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with a different attributes object, which may cause it to behave differently than when it was called with the original attributes object.

DONE.
