  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would allow the loop to continue one extra iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end || iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the loop to continue as long as either condition is true, instead of requiring both conditions to be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < end && !iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used to negate the `hasNext()` method, which would cause the loop to continue as long as there are no more elements in the iterator.

DONE.
