  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + result
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result, which would change the final value returned by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "a" to the result, which would change the final value returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the result, which would change the final value returned by the function.

DONE.
