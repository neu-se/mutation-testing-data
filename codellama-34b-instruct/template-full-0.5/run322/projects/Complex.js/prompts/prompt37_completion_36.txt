  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function would return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `b`, instead of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function would return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `a + b`, instead of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function would return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `a * b`, instead of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `a`.

DONE.
