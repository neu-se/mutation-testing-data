  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and it may have a different value, leading to a different result in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + 1` is a different expression than `x`, and it may produce a different result in the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `x * 2` is a different expression than `x`, and it may produce a different result in the calculation.

DONE.
