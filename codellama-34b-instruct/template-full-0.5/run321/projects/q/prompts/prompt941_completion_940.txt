  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.call(arguments)` would create a shallow copy of the `arguments` object, which is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys of an object, while `arguments` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length` returns the number of arguments passed to a function, while `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
