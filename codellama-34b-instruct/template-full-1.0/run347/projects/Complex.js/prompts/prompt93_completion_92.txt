  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus == 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is 0 or `NaN`, but this replacement would check if it is 1. This small change would cause the function to behave differently when parsing certain input strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus + 1 == 0 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is 0 or `NaN`, but this replacement would check if it is 1 more than zero. This small change would cause the function to behave differently when parsing certain input strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus + 1 == 0 || c == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is `NaN`, but this replacement would
