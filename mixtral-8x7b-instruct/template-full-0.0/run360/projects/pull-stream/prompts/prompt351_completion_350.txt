 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `test` is a falsy value, it will return an empty object instead of the original `test` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `test` is a truthy value, it will return an empty object instead of the original `test` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + {}
