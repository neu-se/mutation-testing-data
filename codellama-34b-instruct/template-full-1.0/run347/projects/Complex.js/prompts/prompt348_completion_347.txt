  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would cause the imaginary part of the returned complex number to have the opposite sign of the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned complex number would have a different imaginary part than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned complex number would have a different imaginary part than the original.

DONE.
