  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the callback function to the current object, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the callback function to null, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the callback function to undefined, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
