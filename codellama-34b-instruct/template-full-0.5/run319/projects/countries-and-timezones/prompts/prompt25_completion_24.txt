  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is multiplied by 2, which would change the offset string returned by `getOffsetStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` variable is passed to `getOffsetStr` instead of `dstOffset`, which would change the offset string returned by `getOffsetStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument is passed to `getOffsetStr`, which would cause the function to return a different offset string.

DONE.
