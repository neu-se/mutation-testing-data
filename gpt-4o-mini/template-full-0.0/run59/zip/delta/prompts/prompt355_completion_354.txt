Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg instanceof Delta
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is an instance of `Delta`, which would incorrectly allow only `Delta` objects to proceed, while the original code allows both `number` and `Delta` types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is a string, which would prevent any `number` or `Delta` from being processed, leading to a failure in handling valid inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `arg` is `null` or `undefined`, which would incorrectly skip the transformation logic for valid `number` or `Delta` types, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
