  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
99
```
This would result in a different zoom level for the tile, potentially leading to a different tile being retrieved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 2
```
This would result in a different zoom level for the tile, potentially leading to a different tile being retrieved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom + 1
```
This would result in a different zoom level for the tile, potentially leading to a different tile being retrieved.

DONE.
