  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the `ops` object as the array, rather than the `ops` property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the `ops` property of the object is an array, rather than checking if the object itself is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `ops` property of the object, rather than checking if the object is an array.

DONE.
