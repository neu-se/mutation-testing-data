 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls `buildCountry` instead of memoizing the country, which could lead to duplicate computations and potential inconsistencies in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
memoizeCountry(buildCountry(data, 'wrongId'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a hardcoded 'wrongId' to the `buildCountry` function, which would store the built country under a different id than expected, causing incorrect values to be returned when requesting countries by id.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
memoizeCountry(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always stores `null` as a country, which would cause issues when trying to access properties of the country object, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

DONE.
