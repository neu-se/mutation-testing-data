  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last part of the path, which could cause the function to return an incorrect type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, 'index.html');
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with "index.html", which could cause the function to return an incorrect type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, '../');
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with "../", which could cause the function to return an incorrect type.

DONE.
