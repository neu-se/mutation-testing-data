  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `StopIteration` exception is not caught. This would cause the `continuer` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `done` property of the `result` object, which would propagate through the promise chain and cause the `spawn` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function is called with no arguments, and therefore the `StopIteration` exception is not caught. This would cause the `continuer` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `done` property of the `result` object, which would propagate through the promise chain and cause the `spawn` function to throw an error.
