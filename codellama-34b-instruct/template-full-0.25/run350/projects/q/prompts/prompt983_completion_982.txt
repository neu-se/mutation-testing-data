  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the `deferred.reject` function, which is not a valid method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the `deferred.resolve` function, which is not a valid method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.notify);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the `deferred.notify` function, which is not a valid method.

DONE.
