  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `nodeback` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `nodeback` is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for inequality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `nodeback` is not strictly equal to `null`.

DONE.
