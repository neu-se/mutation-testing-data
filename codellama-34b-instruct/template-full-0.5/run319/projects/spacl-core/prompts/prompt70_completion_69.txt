  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is not. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string, while the new code fragment is a concatenation of the string and the string 'foo'. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string, while the new code fragment is a substring of the string. This could cause the policy to allow actions that it should not, or deny actions that it should.

DONE.
