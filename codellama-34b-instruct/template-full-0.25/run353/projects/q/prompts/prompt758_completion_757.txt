  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allFulfilled` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would not wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `anyRejected` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would not wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"noneSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `noneSettled` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it would not wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
