  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(thisIter.peekLength()) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the `if` statement, potentially causing the loop to iterate differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete' && thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the `if` statement, potentially causing the loop to iterate differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition of the `if` statement, potentially causing the loop to iterate differently.

DONE.
