  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `name` property using the `!` operator, while this replacement checks for the value of `name` being `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `name` property using the `!` operator, while this replacement checks for the value of `name` being different from `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `name` property using the `!` operator, while this replacement checks for the length of `name` being 0.

DONE.
