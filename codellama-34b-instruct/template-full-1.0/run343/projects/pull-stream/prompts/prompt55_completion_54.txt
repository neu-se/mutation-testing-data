  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive a `null` value instead of a function, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive an empty string instead of a function, which would cause it to return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive the number `0` instead of a function, which would cause it to return `undefined`.

DONE.
