  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor` returns the constructor function of the object `a`, which is not necessarily the same as the type of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.toString()` returns a string representation of the object `a`, which may not be the same as the type of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.valueOf()` returns the primitive value of the object `a`, which may not be the same as the type of `a`.

DONE.
