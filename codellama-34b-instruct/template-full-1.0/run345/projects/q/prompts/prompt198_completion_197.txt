  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` checks the type of a variable, while `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array and `!` checks if it is truthy. Subtle difference, but would change behavior in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array and `length` checks its length, while `!` checks if it is truthy. Subtle difference, but would change behavior in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fileNameAndLineNumber` is an array and `[0]` checks if it has any elements, while `!` checks if it is truthy. Subtle difference, but would change behavior in certain edge cases.
