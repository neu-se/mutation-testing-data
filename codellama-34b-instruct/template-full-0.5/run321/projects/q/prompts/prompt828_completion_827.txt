  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unset the `Q.onerror` property, which is used to handle uncaught exceptions in the `Q` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { throw new Error("Uncaught exception"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `Q.onerror` property to a new function that throws an error when called, causing any uncaught exceptions to be thrown instead of being handled by the `Q` library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() { console.log("Uncaught exception"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `Q.onerror` property to a new function that logs a message to the console when called, but does not throw an error or handle the exception in any way.

DONE.
