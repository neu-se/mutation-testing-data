Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value passed to the callback, while returning `undefined` would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined`, potentially losing the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving with the original value, it would reject the promise with a new error, changing the flow of execution and potentially causing any subsequent `.catch` handlers to be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code simply returns the value, while this change would modify the value by adding 1 to it, altering the expected output of the promise chain.

DONE.
