  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the data directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the data directly, whereas `readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFilePromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFilePromise` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the data directly.

DONE.
