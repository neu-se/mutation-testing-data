Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of `point2Rad` instead of the sine, leading to incorrect distance calculations between two geographical points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine of `point1Rad` instead of `point2Rad`, which would incorrectly affect the distance calculation based on the wrong latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1Rad + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to `point1Rad` before calculating the sine, introducing a constant offset that would distort the distance calculation.

DONE.
