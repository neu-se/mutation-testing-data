  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.notify` to pass the value to the next promise in the chain, whereas this code uses `deferred.resolve` to immediately resolve the promise with the value, bypassing any intermediate promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid value"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.notify` to pass the value to the next promise in the chain, whereas this code uses `deferred.reject` to reject the promise with an error, causing the next promise in the chain to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.notify` to pass the value to the next promise in the chain, whereas this code uses `deferred.notify` to pass
