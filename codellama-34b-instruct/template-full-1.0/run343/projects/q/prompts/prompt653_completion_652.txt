  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from posting a message to getting a property value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from posting a message to setting a property value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation from posting a message to deleting a property.

DONE.
