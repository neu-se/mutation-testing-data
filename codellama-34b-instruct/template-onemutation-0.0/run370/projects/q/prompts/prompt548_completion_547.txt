  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the exception object itself, while the modified code fragment throws the exception message. The exception message may not contain the same information as the exception object, and may not be handled in the same way by the code that catches the exception.
