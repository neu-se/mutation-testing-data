 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the number `0`, while this change uses `null`. The `load` event may expect a number as its second argument, and using `null` could cause unexpected behavior in the event handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded', 0
