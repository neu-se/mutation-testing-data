  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the match pattern, not the replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra 's' to the replacement string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(rule[0], rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the match pattern with the replacement string, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
