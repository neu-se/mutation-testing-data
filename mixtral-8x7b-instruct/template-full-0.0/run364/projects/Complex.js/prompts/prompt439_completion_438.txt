 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the real part of the complex number and always returns the product of 1 and the `places` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the product of the imaginary part and the `places` argument instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number between 0 and 1 multiplied by the `places` argument, instead of the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
