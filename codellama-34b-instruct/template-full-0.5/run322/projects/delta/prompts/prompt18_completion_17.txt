  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of the two objects being compared, rather than comparing them directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a logical AND operation on the two objects being compared, rather than comparing them directly.

DONE.
