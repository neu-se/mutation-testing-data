  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `thisIter.next()` calls the function and returns the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator than `thisIter`, and `otherIter.next()` would return the next value in the iteration of `otherIter`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next value in the iteration, and then `next()` is called on that value, which would result in an error if the value does not have a `next()` method.

DONE.
