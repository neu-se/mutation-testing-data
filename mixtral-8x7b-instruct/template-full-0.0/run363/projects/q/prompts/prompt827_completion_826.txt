 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Handled error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is no longer forwarded to the global `onerror` handler, but instead a new error is thrown, which would not be handled by the existing error handling mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be set as the second argument of the `then` method, and the promise would not be handled properly in case of an unhandled error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be set as the second argument of the `then` method, but it would not contain any error handling logic, and the error would not be forwarded to the global `onerror` handler.

DONE.
