  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'stored'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stored` event is emitted when the data is written to the file, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when all data has been written to the file. Using `stored` instead of `drain` would cause the `close` method to be called before all data has been written to the file, potentially resulting in data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` event is emitted when the data is flushed to the file, whereas the `drain` event is emitted when all data has been written to the file. Using `flush` instead of `drain` would cause the `close` method to be called before all data has been written to the file, potentially resulting in data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
