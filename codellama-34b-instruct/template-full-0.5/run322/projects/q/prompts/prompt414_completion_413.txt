  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.value` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.method
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.method` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.property
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.property` is not a function and would throw a `TypeError` if called.

DONE.
