  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nbind` method to skip the first argument passed to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nbind` method to skip the first two arguments passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nbind` method to pass an invalid value for the `thisp` argument to the callback function.

DONE.
