  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is not the same as `uncurryThis`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is not the same as `uncurryThis`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Math.max)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` is not the same as `uncurryThis`.

DONE.
