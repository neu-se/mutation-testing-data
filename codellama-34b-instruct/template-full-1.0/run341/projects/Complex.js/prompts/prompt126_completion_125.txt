  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the number is NaN, while `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is positive or negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a property referring to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `isInfinite` is a property referring to whether the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so the result would be the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
