  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new rule to the existing rules, which are used to determine the plural form of a word. By adding a new rule for the word "goose," the plural form of that word would be "geese," which is not the same as the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new rule to the existing rules, but the rule uses a different function to determine the plural form of the word. In this case, the function simply appends an 's' to the end of the word, which would not work for all words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'poultry')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new rule to the existing rules
