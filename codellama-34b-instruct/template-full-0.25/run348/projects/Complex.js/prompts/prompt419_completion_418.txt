  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
