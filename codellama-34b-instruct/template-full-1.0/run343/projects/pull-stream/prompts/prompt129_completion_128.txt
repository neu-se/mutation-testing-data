  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, but `cb` is a function, and the `cb` function is being used to invoke another function. Replacing `cb` with `null` would cause the code to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is used to represent the absence of a value. Replacing `cb` with `undefined` would cause the code to behave differently, as `undefined` is not a function and would not be able to be invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and objects are not functions, so the code would crash or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
