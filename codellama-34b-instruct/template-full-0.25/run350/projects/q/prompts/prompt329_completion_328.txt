  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

DONE.
