  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function that is expected to be called when the draining is complete, while `undefined` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will not be called, while `done` is a function that is expected to be called when the draining is complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => {}` is a function that does nothing, while `done` is a function that is expected to be called when the draining is complete.

DONE.
