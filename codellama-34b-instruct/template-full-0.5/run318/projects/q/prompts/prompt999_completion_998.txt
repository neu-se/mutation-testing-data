  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(null, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the modified code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle success.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the modified code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle success.
