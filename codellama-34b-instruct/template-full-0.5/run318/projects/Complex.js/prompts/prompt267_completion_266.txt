  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hypot(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hypot(a + b, a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are modified, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hypot(a, b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant is added to the result, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
