  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler.transform` method would not be called, and the `transform` method would return `this.ops`, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let embedType = ['image', 'video', 'formula'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler` variable would be overwritten with a new value, and the `transform` method would use the new value instead of the original one, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform = function (otherData) {
    return otherData;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method would always return the `otherData` argument, regardless of the input, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
