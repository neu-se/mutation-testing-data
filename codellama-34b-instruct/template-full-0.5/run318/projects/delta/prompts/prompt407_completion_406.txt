  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transformation to be performed in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `transform` is reversed, which would cause the transformation to be performed in a different direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transformation to be performed in the opposite order, and the order of the arguments to `transform` is reversed, which would cause the transformation to be performed in a different direction.
