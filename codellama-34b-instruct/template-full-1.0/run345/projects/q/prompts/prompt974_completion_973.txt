  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the input object, while the replacement code fragment would return null, even if the input object was not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the input object, while the replacement code fragment would return undefined, even if the input object was not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the input object, while the replacement code fragment would return the string "hello", which is neither null nor undefined.

DONE.
