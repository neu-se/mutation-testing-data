  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`, which returns the result of calling `abortCb` with the given arguments. However, the new code fragment simply calls `abortCb` without returning its result, which could cause the function to return a different value or have different side effects.

DONE.
