 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be fulfilled with `null` instead of being rejected when all input promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Rejected'))
