 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'im' in window && 're' in window
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of 'im' and 're' properties in the global 'window' object instead of the input 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'im' in a && a.hasOwnProperty('re')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'hasOwnProperty' method to check if 're' is a direct property of the input 'a', instead of just checking if it exists as a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'im' in a && Object.prototype.toString.call(a.re) === '[object Number]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'a.re' is an instance of the Number object, adding an additional constraint to the input 'a'.

DONE.
