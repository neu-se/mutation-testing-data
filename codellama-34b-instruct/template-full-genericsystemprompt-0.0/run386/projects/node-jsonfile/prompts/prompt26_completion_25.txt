  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the reviver function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the reviver function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would cause the reviver function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
