```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `href` attribute of the current element, which may not be the same as the value of the `href` attribute of the `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', function() {
  return 'http://example.com';
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `href` attribute of the current element to the return value of the function, which may not be the same as the value of the `
