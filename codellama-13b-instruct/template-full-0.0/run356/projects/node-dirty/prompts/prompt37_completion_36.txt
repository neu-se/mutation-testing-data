  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the Map instead of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the Map instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the Map instead of the keys or values.

DONE.
