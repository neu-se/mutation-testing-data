  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'empty'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Dirty` class would emit the `'empty'` event instead of the `'drain'` event, which would indicate that the write stream is empty and ready for more data, but it would not actually drain the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Dirty` class would emit the `'error'` event instead of the `'drain'` event, which would indicate that an error occurred while writing to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'random'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Dirty` class would emit a random event instead of the `'drain'` event, which would make the code unpredictable and potentially cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
