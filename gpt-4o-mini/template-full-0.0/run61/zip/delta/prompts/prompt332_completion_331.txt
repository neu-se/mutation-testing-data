Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.merge
```
This would result in different behavior because `merge` might combine attributes instead of inverting them, leading to incorrect attribute handling during the transformation process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.remove
```
This would result in different behavior because `remove` would likely delete attributes instead of inverting them, which could cause loss of necessary attribute information during the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` would apply a transformation to the attributes rather than inverting them, potentially altering the intended state of the attributes in the resulting Delta.

DONE.
