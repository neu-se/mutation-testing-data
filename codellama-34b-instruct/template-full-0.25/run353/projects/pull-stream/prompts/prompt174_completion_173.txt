  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is used to determine the length of the array, while the modified code fragment `array.length - 1` would result in a shorter array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is used to determine the length of the array, while the modified code fragment `array.slice(1)` would result in a shorter array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is used to determine the length of the array, while the modified code fragment `array.filter(function(x) { return x !== undefined; })` would result in a shorter array.

DONE.
