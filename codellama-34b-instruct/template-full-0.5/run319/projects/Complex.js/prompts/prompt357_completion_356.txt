  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(a)` is equivalent to `cos(a)` in the context of the code, but it would cause a type error because `a` is a complex number and `cos` only accepts real numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(a)` is equivalent to `sin(a)` in the context of the code, but it would cause a type error because `a` is a complex number and `sin` only accepts real numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(a)` is equivalent to `tan(a)` in the context of the code, but it would cause a type error because `a` is a complex number and `tan` only accepts real numbers.

DONE.
