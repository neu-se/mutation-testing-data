  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array, which is not the intended behavior of the `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the unhandled rejections array, but it would not update the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag, which is also part of the `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `trackUnhandledRejections` flag to `false`, but it would not reset the unhandled rejections array, which is also part of the `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` method.
