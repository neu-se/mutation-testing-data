  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider URLs with the same number of path parts as internal, whereas the original code considers them external.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length > pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider URLs with more path parts than the base URL as internal, whereas the original code considers them external.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_slashes > pageurl_slashes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider URLs with more slashes than the base URL as internal, whereas the original code considers them external.

DONE.
