  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This change will cause the `fapply` method to call the function with the `args` array as the `this` context, rather than passing it as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This change will cause the `fapply` method to call the function with the `args` array as the `this` context, and pass an array containing the `args` array as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat([])]
```
This change will cause the `fapply` method to call the function with the `args` array as the `this` context, and pass an array containing the `args` array and an empty array as the first argument.

DONE.
