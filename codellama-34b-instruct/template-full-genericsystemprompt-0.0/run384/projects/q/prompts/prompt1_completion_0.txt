  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not enter the `if` block and would not execute the `bootstrap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block and would execute the `bootstrap` function, but the function would not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block and would execute the `bootstrap` function, but the function would not be a function and would throw an error.

DONE.
