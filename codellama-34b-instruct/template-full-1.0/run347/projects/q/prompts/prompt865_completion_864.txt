  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects a value to be passed as the first argument, and passing `undefined` would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects a value to be passed as the first argument, and passing `null` would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` expects a value to be passed as the first argument, and passing `0` would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
