  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, function (end, data) {
  //if ended immediately, and no initial...
  if(end) return cb(end === true ? null : end)
  acc = data;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` function is called with the `null` value as the first argument, which would cause the `drain` function to return a sink that does not have the same behavior as the original sink.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(function (data) {
  acc = reducer(acc, data)
}, function (err) {
  cb(err, acc)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` function is called with a different set of arguments, which would cause the `drain` function to return a sink that does not have the same behavior as the original sink.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
