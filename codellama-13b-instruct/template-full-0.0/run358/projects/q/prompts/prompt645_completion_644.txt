  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` itself, while the new code fragment returns a promise for the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `post` method to invoke the method on the `object`, while the new code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to invoke the method on the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to invoke the method on the `object`, while the new code fragment uses the `dispatch` method to invoke the method on the `object`.

DONE.
