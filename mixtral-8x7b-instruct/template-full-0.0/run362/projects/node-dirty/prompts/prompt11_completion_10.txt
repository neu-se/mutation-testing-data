 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` returns a boolean indicating whether an element exists in the map, while `get` returns the value associated with the key if it exists, or `undefined` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.prototype.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype` is used to add properties to all objects of a certain type, and it doesn't exist on the `Map` object. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue['get']
```
This would result in different behavior because using bracket notation with a string key will look for a property with that name on the object, rather than calling the `get` method on the `Map` object. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
