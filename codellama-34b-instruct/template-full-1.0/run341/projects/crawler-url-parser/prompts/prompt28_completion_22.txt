  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<CODE FRAGMENT>
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the return value of the `test` method, causing the code block inside the `{}` to execute even if the `baseUrlStr` is not defined, which can lead to a null reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?/.test(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression checks if the string starts with "http" or "https" rather than the original code fragment that checks for the string length. If the input string starts with "http" or "https", it would return false negatives for the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.includes('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code checks if the string includes the word "http" instead of specifing the search pattern with regex. The code would return true for all strings that includes "http".
