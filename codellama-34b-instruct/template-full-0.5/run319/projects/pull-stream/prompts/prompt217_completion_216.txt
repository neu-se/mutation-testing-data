  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with two arguments, `err` and `data`. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to be called with only one argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with two arguments, `err` and `data`. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to be called with only one argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with two arguments, `err` and `data`. Replacing it with an empty function would cause the function to be called with only one argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
