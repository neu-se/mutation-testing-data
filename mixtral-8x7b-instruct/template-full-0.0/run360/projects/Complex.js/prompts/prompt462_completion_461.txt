 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the real part of the complex number, instead of comparing it with the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compare the imaginary part of the complex number with itself, instead of comparing the absolute imaginary part with the `EPSILON` constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re'] + this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the absolute value of the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of comparing the absolute imaginary part with the `EPSILON` constant.

DONE.
