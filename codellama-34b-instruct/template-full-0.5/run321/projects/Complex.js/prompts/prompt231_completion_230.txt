  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` to calculate the square root, while the new code fragment uses the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` to calculate the square root, while the new code fragment uses the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` to calculate the square root, while the new code fragment uses the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
