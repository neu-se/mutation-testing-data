  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `false`, regardless of the input values `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': a + b }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the sum of `a` and `b`, instead of the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': a * b }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the product of `a` and `b`, instead of the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
