  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the basename of the destination path, rather than the extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the parent directory of the destination path, rather than the extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the extension of the URL, rather than the destination path.

DONE.
