  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the `newOp` object onto the `delta.ops` array, while this modified code pushes the `newOp` object onto the `delta` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the `otherOp` object onto the `delta.ops` array, while this modified code pushes the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the last element of the `delta.ops` array onto the `delta` object, while this modified code pushes the last element of the `delta` object onto the `delta` object itself.

DONE
