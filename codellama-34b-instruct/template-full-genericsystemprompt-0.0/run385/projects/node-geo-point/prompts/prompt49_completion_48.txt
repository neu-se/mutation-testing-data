  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values are swapped, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value of the first point is used instead of the second point, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value of the second point is increased by 1, which would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
