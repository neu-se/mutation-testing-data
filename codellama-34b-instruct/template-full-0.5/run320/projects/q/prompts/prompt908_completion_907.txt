  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `arguments` would return an object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` would concatenate `args` and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` into a new array, whereas `arguments` would return an object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function (arg) { return arg !== deferred.makeNodeResolver(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter(function (arg) { return arg !== deferred.makeNodeResolver(); })` would return a new array containing all elements of
