  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to split the string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment uses the `\\` operator to split the string into an array of substrings. The `\\` operator is used to escape special characters in a string, so it will not split the string in the same way as the `/` operator.
