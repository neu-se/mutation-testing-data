 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would not be called when an exception is thrown in the `_progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would not be called when an exception is thrown in the `_progressed` function. Instead, the exception would be silently ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would not be called when an exception is thrown in the `_progressed` function. Instead, the exception would be logged to the console.

DONE.
