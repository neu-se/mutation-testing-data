Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(targetPath, path.basename(file.name))
```
This would result in different behavior because it constructs the target path by joining the target directory with the base name of the source file, instead of replacing the source path with the target path in the source file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath + '/' + path.basename(file.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the target path with the base name of the source file using string concatenation, which may not handle path separators correctly on all platforms.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file.name.replace(currentPath, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the current path from the source file name instead of replacing it with the target path, which would result in a relative path being used as the target.

DONE.
