  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the new op would be inserted at the beginning of the `ops` array instead of at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(Math.min(index, this.ops.length), 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `index` is less than the length of the `ops` array, the new op would be inserted at the beginning of the array instead of at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(Math.max(0, index), 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `index` is greater than the length of the `ops` array, the new op would be inserted at the end of the array instead of at the beginning.

DONE.
