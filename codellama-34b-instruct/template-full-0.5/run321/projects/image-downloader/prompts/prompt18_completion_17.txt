  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable is not the same as the `decodedBasename` variable, which may contain different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.dirname(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname` method returns the directory name of the path, which may be different from the `basename` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename` method returns the base name of the path, which may be different from the `decodedBasename` variable.

DONE.
