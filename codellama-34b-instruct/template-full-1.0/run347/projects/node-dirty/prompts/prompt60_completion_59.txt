  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to check the `_writeStream` property instead of the `_readStream` property, which could lead to different execution paths and potentially uncover new bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to assume that the `_readStream` property is always `null`, which could lead to null pointer exceptions and other errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.isReadable()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to check the readability of the `_writeStream` property instead of the `_readStream` property, which could lead to different execution paths and potentially uncover new bugs.

DONE.
