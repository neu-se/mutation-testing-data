  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones) { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return early, without executing the rest of the code, which would cause unintended consequences for the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (totalTimezones < memoizedTimezones) { throw new Error('Memoization error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, which would cause the application to fail, even if the memoization logic was correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (totalTimezones === memoizedTimezones) { return deliverTimezones(timezones, options); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, which would cause unintended consequences for the application.

DONE.
