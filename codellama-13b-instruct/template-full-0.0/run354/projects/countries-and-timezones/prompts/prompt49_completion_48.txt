  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only iterate over the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code iterates over all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of time zone names, whereas the original code returns an array of time zones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).reduce((prev, tz) => {
  if (tz.deprecated) {
    prev.push(tz);
  }
  return prev;
}, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add deprecated time zones to the array, whereas the original code adds all time zones to the array.

DONE
