Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` would cause the promise to resolve with `null` instead of `undefined`, potentially leading to different handling in subsequent `.then()` calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would pass the current promise object to the next handler instead of `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected results if the next handler expects an `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Progress error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with a new error instead of allowing it to proceed with `undefined`, which would disrupt the promise chain and trigger any rejection handlers.

DONE.
