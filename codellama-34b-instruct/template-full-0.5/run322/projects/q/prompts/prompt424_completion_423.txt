  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value !== undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the original code used the `===` operator, which checks for abstract equality. This could cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value !== null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the original code used the `===` operator, which checks for abstract equality. This could cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value !== void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the original code used the `===` operator, which checks for abstract equality. This could cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

DONE.
