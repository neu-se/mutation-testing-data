  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListener` is a function, and calling it would invoke the function, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListener.call()` would invoke the function with the `this` context set to the global object, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListener.bind()` would create a new function with the `this` context set to the global object, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
