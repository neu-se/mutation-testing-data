  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the first iteration, as `end + 1` would be greater than `max` (which is initialized to `Infinity` if not specified).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `max` is not specified, as `max` is initialized to `Infinity` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `i` is 0, and `i` is initialized to 0 before the first iteration.

DONE.
