  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function and the original code fragment is not calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have the `&&` operator and the `onAbort` function is not being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort || onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have the `||` operator and the `onAbort` function is not being called.

DONE.
