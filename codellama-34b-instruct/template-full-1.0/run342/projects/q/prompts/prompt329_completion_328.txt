  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that can be used to throw an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that is defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value that is often used to indicate failure or rejection, whereas `reject` is a function that is defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `reject` is a function that is defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
