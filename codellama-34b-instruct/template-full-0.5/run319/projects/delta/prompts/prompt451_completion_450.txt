  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element, while this new code fragment checks if the iterator does not have a next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element, while this new code fragment checks if the iterator's current element is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the iterator has a next element, while this new code fragment checks if the iterator's current element has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
