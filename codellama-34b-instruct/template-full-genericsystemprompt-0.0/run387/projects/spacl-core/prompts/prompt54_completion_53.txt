  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is called on the `part` variable, which is a string, and the regular expression `/([.$])/g` matches any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign. The replacement string `\\$1` escapes the matched character, which would result in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+)/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/([^/]+)/g` matches any character that is not a forward slash, and the replacement string `\\$1` escapes the matched character, which would result in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+
