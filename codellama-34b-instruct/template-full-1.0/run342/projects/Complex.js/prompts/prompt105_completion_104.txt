  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is `parser_exit()`, which would throw a `SyntaxError` and stop the parser, while this new code would replace the value of `PLACEHOLDER` with `1` and continue parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus += tokens[i];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is `plus += 1`, which is incrementing the `plus` variable by `1` for each loop iteration, while this new code is `plus += tokens[i]`, which would update the `plus` variable with the value of the current token, potentially resulting in a different final value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus += tokens[i];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is `minus += 1`, which is incrementing the `minus` variable by `1` for each loop iteration, while this new
