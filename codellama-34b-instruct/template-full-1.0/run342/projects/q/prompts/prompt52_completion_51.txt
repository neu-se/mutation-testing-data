  I have identified 3 plausible mutations for the provided code snippet. Please find them below:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function() { setTimeout(flush, 0); process.nextTick(flush);};
```
This changes the `requestTick` function to call both `setTimeout` and `process.nextTick` with `flush`. This would result in different behavior because it would create a race condition between the two functions, which could cause issues with the order of execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function() { flush(); };
```
This changes the `requestTick` function to immediately call `flush` without using `setTimeout` or `process.nextTick`. This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the delay introduced by the `setTimeout` and `process.nextTick` calls.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function() { setTimeout(flush, 1);
