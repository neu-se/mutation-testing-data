 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof module.parent === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the undefined type of module.parent, which may not have the same effect as the negated existence check in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!module.exports
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of module.exports, which may not have the same effect as checking for module.parent in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!global.module.parent
