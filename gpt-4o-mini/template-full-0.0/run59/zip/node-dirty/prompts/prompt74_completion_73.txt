Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a value of 1 instead of 0, which could mislead listeners into thinking that one item was loaded instead of none.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a null value instead of a number, which may cause type-related issues for listeners expecting a numeric value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'load' event with a value that is one greater than the actual size of the data, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the number of items loaded.

DONE.
