  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "a" to the end of the word, while the new fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteriuma'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "a" to the end of the word, while the new fragment would add "a" to the end of the word and then add "a" again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteriaa'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "a" to the end of the word, while the new fragment would add "a" to the end of the word and then add another "a".

DONE.
