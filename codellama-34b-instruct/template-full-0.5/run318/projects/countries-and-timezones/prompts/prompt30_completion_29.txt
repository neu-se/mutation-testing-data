  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function would receive a different input, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function would receive a different input, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(input + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function would receive a different input, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
