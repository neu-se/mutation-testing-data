  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method is not defined in the `Delta` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.prototype.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because `Delta.prototype.getHandler` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.prototype.getHandler = function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` method would always return `null`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
