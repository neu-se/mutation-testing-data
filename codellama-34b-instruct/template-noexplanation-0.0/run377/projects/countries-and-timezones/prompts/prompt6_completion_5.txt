  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `id` variable instead of `data` to access the `timezones` object. This change may cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return a different result, which could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[a]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `a` variable instead of `data` to access the `timezones` object. This change may cause the `buildTimezonesMap` function to return a different result, which could potentially cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different result as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id].c
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `id` variable to access
