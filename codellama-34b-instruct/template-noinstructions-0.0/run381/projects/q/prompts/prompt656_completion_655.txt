  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, potentially causing it to fail or return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, potentially causing it to fail or return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, potentially causing it to fail or return incorrect results.

DONE.
