  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was getting the "tail" property of the promise, while the new code fragment is getting the "head" property. This change would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
