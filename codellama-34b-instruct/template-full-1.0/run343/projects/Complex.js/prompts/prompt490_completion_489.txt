  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.isZero = function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would always return `false`, even when the complex number is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.isFinite = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method would always return `true`, even when the complex number is actually infinite or NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.valueOf = function() { return 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method would always return `0`, even when the complex number is actually a non-zero value.

DONE.
