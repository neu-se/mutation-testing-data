  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would bind the `this` context to `promise`, whereas `apply` would bind it to `descriptor[op]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise)(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with the `this` context bound to `promise`, whereas `apply` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would pass the `args` array as a list of arguments to `descriptor[op]`, whereas `call` would pass each element of `args` as a separate argument.

DONE.
