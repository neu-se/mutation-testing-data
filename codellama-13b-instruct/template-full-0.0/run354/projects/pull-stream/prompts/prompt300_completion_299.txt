  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `true` before the `read` function is called, which would cause the `read` function to return immediately with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `false` before the `read` function is called, which would cause the `read` function to continue reading data even if the `ended` flag is set to `true` later on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable would be set to `null` before the `read` function is called, which would cause the `read` function to continue reading data even if the `ended` flag is set to `true` later on.

DONE.
