  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be negated, causing the filter function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be incremented by 1, causing the filter function to return a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be multiplied by 2, causing the filter function to return a different set of elements.

DONE.
