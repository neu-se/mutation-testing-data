  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last letter of the word and add 'ies' to the end, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 'es' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is already plural or not.

DONE.
