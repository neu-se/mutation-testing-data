  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not a valid argument for the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, []
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not a valid argument for the `apply` method.

DONE.
