Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('lat')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a property named 'lat' instead of 'longitude', which would cause the validation to fail even if the object has a valid 'longitude' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'latitude' property is undefined instead of checking for the existence of the 'longitude' property, potentially allowing an object with a valid 'latitude' but missing 'longitude' to pass the validation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'longitude' property is falsy (which could be 0 or null) rather than checking for its existence, allowing objects with a falsy 'longitude' to pass the validation incorrectly.

DONE.
