  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object` would check if the variable `object` is falsy, which would always be the case if `object` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object === null` would check if the variable `object` is null, which would be true if `object` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object === 'undefined'` would check if the variable `object` is undefined, which would be true if `object` is undefined.

DONE.
