  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire line, while `inverted.retain` would only retain the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(length, {})` would retain the entire line without any attributes, while `inverted.retain` would retain the line with the original attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(length, { color: 'red' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain(length, { color: 'red' })` would retain the entire line with a red color attribute, while `inverted.retain` would retain the line with the original attributes.

DONE.
