 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a `null` argument, which could cause it to throw an exception or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Complex(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a `Complex` object as an argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
