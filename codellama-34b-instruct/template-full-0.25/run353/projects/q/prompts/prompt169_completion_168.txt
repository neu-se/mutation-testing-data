  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isExternalFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack frame is from an external file, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is from the current file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack frame is from the Node.js runtime, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is from the current file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(stackLine, qFileName, qStartingLine, qEndingLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack frame is from the current file, and passing in the file name, starting line, and ending line as arguments would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
