  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` would return the length of the stack trace, which would likely be different from the index of the first newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first newline character plus 2, which would likely be different from the original index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the last newline character plus 1, which would likely be different from the original index.

DONE.
