  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are the same, which would cause the database to always return the same value for any key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are the same, which would cause the database to always return the same value for any key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which would cause the database to return incorrect values for any key.

DONE.
