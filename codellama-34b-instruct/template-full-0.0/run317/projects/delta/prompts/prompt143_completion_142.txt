  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and subtracting 1 would cause the iterator to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and adding 1 would cause the iterator to include an extra operation that it would not have included otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and multiplying by 2 would cause the iterator to include twice as many operations as it would have included otherwise.

DONE.
