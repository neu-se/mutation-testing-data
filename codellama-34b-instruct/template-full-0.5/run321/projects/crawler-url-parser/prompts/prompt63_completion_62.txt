  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` would return the hostname of the URL, which may be different from the hostname of the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.protocol` would return the protocol of the URL, which may be different from the protocol of the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.port
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.port` would return the port of the URL, which may be different from the port of the base URL.

DONE.
