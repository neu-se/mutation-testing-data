  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line has a non-zero length, while the replaced code fragment checks if the line has a negative length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line has a non-zero length, while the replaced code fragment checks if the line has a zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the line has a non-zero length, while the replaced code fragment checks if the line has a length greater than 1.

DONE.
