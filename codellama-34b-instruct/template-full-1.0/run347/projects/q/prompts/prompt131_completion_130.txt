  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code call the `uncurryThis` function recursively, potentially causing a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThat
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code call a different function called `uncurryThat`, which may or may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurry()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code call a function called `uncurry`, which may or may not exist.

DONE.
