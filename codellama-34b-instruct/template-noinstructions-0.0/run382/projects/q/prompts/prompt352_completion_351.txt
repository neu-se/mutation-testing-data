  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `rejected` is a function that rejects the promise with an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("rejected")` would throw an error with the message "rejected", whereas `rejected` is a function that rejects the promise with an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `return reject(new Error("rejected"))` would return a rejected promise with an error message "rejected", whereas `rejected` is a function that rejects the promise with an exception.

DONE.
