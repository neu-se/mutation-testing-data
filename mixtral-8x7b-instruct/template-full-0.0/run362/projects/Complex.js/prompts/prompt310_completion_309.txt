 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the complex number, instead of the original code which uses the variable `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2) * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the square root of 2 times the variable `a`, instead of the original code which uses 2 times `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1 instead of the original code which uses the value of `a`. This would cause the function to return different results each time it is called, even with the same input.

DONE.
