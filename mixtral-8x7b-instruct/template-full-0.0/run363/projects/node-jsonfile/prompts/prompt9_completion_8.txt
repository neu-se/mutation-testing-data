 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * data
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the data by 1, which doesn't change the value of data, but it introduces an unnecessary operation that could potentially hide bugs related to data's value being used in mathematical computations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || 'default value'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces data with a default value if data is falsy, which could hide bugs related to data's value being checked for truthiness in other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts data to a string, which could hide bugs related to data's type being checked or used in type-specific operations in other parts of the code.

DONE.
