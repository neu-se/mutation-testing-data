 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'coordinates2'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a non-existent property, causing the method to throw a TypeError instead of checking if the 'coordinates' property exists and has the correct number of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'longitude'
