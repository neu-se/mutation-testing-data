  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'trout', 'troys'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for `'goose', 'geese'` is a special case rule that is not handled by the generic rule for words that end in -s.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'robot', 'bot'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for `'goose', 'geese'` is a special case rule that is not handled by the generic rule for words that end in -s.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'house', 'houses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for `'goose', 'geese'` is a special case rule that is not handled by the generic rule for words that end in -s.

DONE.
