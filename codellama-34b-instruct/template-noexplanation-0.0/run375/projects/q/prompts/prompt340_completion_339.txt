  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is in the "fulfilled" state, which is the opposite of the original code fragment that checks if the promise is in the "pending" or "rejected" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is in the "pending" state, which is the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This code fragment checks if the promise is in the "rejected" state, which is the opposite of the original code fragment that checks if the promise is in the "pending" or "fulfilled" state.

DONE.
