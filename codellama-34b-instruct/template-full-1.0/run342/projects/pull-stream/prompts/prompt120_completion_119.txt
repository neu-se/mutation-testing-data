  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not being evaluated, and the `acc` variable is not being assigned a value when `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable is being assigned a value regardless of whether `end` is true or false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
accelerate(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `accelerate` function is being called with the `source` argument, which is not the same as the `acc` variable.

DONE.
