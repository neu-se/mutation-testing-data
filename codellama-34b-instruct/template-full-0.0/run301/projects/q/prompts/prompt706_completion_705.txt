  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array and returns a new array containing the removed elements, whereas `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

DONE.
