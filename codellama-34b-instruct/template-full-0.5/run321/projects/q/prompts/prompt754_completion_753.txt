  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current object. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current object. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current object. Replacing it with `1` would cause the function to return `1` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
