  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substring(1)` would return the second character of the `path` string, while `path` would return the entire `path` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.length + 1` would return the length of the `path` string plus 1, while `path` would return the entire `path` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.indexOf("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.indexOf("/")` would return the index of the first occurrence of the character "/" in the `path` string, while `path` would return the entire `path` string.

DONE.
