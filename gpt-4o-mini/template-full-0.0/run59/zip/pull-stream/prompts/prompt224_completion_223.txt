Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `test` function, causing the filter to include items that would normally be excluded, effectively reversing the intended filtering logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `test` is strictly equal to `true`, which would only pass if `test` is a boolean true value, potentially leading to incorrect filtering if `test` is a function that returns true for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `false`, causing the filter to exclude all items regardless of the actual test logic, effectively filtering out everything.

DONE.
