  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (e !== undefined) {
    throw e;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an exception when `e` is not undefined, instead of the original behavior of re-throwing `e` if `isNodeJS` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exit the domain with a `false` exit code, instead of the original behavior of exiting the domain with no exit code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule `flush` to be called after a 1-second delay, instead of the original behavior of calling `flush` immediately.

DONE.
