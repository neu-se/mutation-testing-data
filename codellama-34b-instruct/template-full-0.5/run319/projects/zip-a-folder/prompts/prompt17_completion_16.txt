  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"targetBasePath" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "foo" to the end of the targetBasePath, which would change the path that is being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the targetBasePath to uppercase, which could change the path that is being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.replace("target", "foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string "target" with "foo" in the targetBasePath, which could change the path that is being accessed.

DONE.
