  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toFixed()` method rounds the number to the given number of decimal places, so `1.5.toFixed(0)` would result in the number `2`, while `1.5.toFixed(1)` would result in the number `1.5`. Using `1` as the argument would cause the `adjust` function to always round down to the nearest integer, which would result in unexpected behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toFixed()` method rounds the number to the given number of decimal places, so `1.5.toFixed(10)` would result in the number `1.5000000000`, which is not the same as `1.5`. Using `10` as the argument would cause the `adjust` function to always round to the nearest tenth, which would result in unexpected behavior in some cases.
