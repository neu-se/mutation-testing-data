  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This code fragment will delete the key from the queue, which will cause the callbacks to not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This code fragment will set the value of the key in the queue to an empty array, which will cause the callbacks to not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice(1));
```
This code fragment will set the value of the key in the queue to a slice of the callbacks array, starting from the second element. This will cause the first callback to not be executed.

DONE.
