  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` function expects a promise or immediate reference for the target object, but `null` is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` function expects a promise or immediate reference for the target object, but `undefined` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.mapply` function expects a promise or immediate reference for the target object, but `{}` is not a valid object.

DONE.
