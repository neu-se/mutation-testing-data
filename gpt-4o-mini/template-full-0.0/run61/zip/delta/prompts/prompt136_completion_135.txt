Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to peek at the first operation in the `other` Delta as if it had a retain value of 0, which could lead to incorrect handling of subsequent operations that rely on the actual retain value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always consider the first operation in the `other` Delta as having a retain value of 1, potentially skipping over valid operations that should be processed based on their actual retain values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation from `thisIter` instead of the first operation's retain value from `otherIter`, which could lead to incorrect processing of operations and potentially result in lost or mismanaged operations in the composed Delta.

DONE.
