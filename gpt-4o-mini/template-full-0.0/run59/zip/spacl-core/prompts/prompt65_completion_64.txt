Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the existing rules in the policy, effectively removing all rules instead of adding the new ones, which could lead to unexpected access control outcomes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(new Rule('default', false))
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new rule that explicitly denies access by default, which could override any previously defined rules and lead to a situation where access is denied even if other rules would allow it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.push(...rules.map(rule => rule.clone()))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add clones of the provided rules instead of the original references, which could lead to inconsistencies if the original rules are modified later, as the policy would not reflect those changes.

DONE.
