  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of an array, while `size` is a property of a map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, and then `length` is applied to the iterator, which would always be 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map, and then `length` is applied to the iterator, which would always be 1.

DONE.
