  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus > 0 ? c : c
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator is used incorrectly. The condition `minus > 0` is always false, and the expression `c` is always returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos()` function expects a numerical argument, but `c` is a string. The function will return `NaN`, which will cause the application to exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c++
```
This would result in different behavior because the postfix increment operator `++` is used on a string value. The string will be converted to a number, and the increment will be applied to that number. However, this will not affect the overall behavior of the application.

DONE.
