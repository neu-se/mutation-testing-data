Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` advances the iterator and returns the next operation, while `iter.peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing, potentially leading to incorrect processing of operations in the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` retrieves the type of the next operation without returning the operation itself, which could cause the logic that expects an operation object to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length of the next operation would incorrectly assume that there is an additional character or operation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect processing of the delta operations.

DONE.
