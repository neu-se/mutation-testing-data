  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function, and `prop.test` is a property that is not a function, so the code would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function that takes no arguments, and `prop.test()` would call that function with no arguments, which would likely cause a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function, and `prop.test.bind(null)` would create a new function that is bound to `null`, which would likely cause a different result than the original code.

DONE.
