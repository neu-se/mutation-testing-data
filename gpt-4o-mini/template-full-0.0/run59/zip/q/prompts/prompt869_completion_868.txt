Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with `undefined` instead of the original resolved value, potentially leading to unexpected results in subsequent promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would resolve with the original value incremented by 1, altering the expected outcome of any operations that depend on the original resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Delayed error")
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving successfully, the promise would reject with an error, which would change the flow of execution in any promise chains that follow.

DONE.
