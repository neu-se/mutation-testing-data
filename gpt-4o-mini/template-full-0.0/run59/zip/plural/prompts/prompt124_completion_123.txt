Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize uncountable nouns by adding an 's' to them, which is not the intended behavior for words like "water" or "money".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word instead of the word itself, which would not provide a valid plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the word to uppercase instead of returning the original word, which is not the expected outcome for pluralization.

DONE.
