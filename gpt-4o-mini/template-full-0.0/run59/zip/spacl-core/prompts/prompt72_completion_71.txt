Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the `ctx` object may lead to unexpected results in the `rule.query` method, potentially causing it to behave incorrectly if it relies on properties of `ctx`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` as the context may cause the `rule.query` method to interpret it as a valid context, which could lead to rules being evaluated incorrectly, potentially allowing actions that should be denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_context"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `"invalid_context"` instead of the expected `ctx` object may cause the `rule.query` method to fail or return unexpected results, as it may not be able to process a string in the same way it would process a `QueryContext` object.

DONE.
