  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a subarray from an array, but the `reverse` method is used to reverse the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x % 2 === 0; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a subarray from an array, but the `filter` method is used to create a new array with only the elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to extract a subarray from an array, but the `map` method is used to create a new array with the results
