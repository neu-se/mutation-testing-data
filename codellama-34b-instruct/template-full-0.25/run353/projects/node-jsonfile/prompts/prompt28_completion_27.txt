  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `shouldThrow` is a boolean variable, and `shouldThrow === true` would only be true if `shouldThrow` is true, whereas `shouldThrow` by itself would be true if `shouldThrow` is true or if it is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `!shouldThrow` would be true if `shouldThrow` is false, whereas `shouldThrow` by itself would be true if `shouldThrow` is true or if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `shouldThrow !== true` would be true if `shouldThrow` is false or if it is not defined, whereas `shouldThrow` by itself would be true if `shouldThrow` is true or if it is not defined.

DONE.
