  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(x)` is not the same as `temp`, which is a variable that represents the value of `Math.cos(x)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(x)` is not the same as `temp`, which is a variable that represents the value of `Math.sin(x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(x)` is not the same as `temp`, which is a variable that represents the value of `Math.cos(x)`.

DONE.
