  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be in a progress state instead of resolved.

DONE.
