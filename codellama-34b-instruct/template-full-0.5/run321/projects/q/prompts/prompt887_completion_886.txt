  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `arguments` object is an array, but if it is replaced with `null`, the check will always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `arguments` object is an array, but if it is replaced with `undefined`, the check will always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `arguments` object is an array, but if it is replaced with an empty array, the check will always return `true`.

DONE.
