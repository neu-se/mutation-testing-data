  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `z['re']` to calculate the real part of the result, while the modified code fragment uses `z['im']` instead. This would cause the real part of the result to be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
