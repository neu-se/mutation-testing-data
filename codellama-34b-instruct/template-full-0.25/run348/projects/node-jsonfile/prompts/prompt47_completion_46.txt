  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the file name, which would likely cause the file to not be found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the file name to uppercase, which would likely cause the file to not be found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the file name, which would likely cause the file to not be found.

DONE.
