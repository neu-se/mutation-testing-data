  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next` returns a reference to the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length)` returns the next `length` operations in the iterator, while `otherIter.next` returns a reference to the `next` method itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())` returns the next `peekLength` operations in the iterator, while `otherIter.next` returns a reference to the `next` method itself.

DONE.
