  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test(data)` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is a reference to a function that takes a single argument and returns a value based on the type of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.test(data)` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is a reference to a function that takes a single argument and returns a value based on the type of the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.test(prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.test(prop)` is a function call that returns a boolean value, whereas `prop` is a reference to a function that takes a single argument and returns a value based on the type of the argument.

DONE.
