  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `a - 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment uses the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment uses the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
