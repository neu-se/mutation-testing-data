  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the argument `b`, which is a real number, while the mutated code fragment returns `-infinity`, which is not a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the argument `b`, which is a real number, while the mutated code fragment returns `NaN`, which is not a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the argument `b`, which is a real number, while the mutated code fragment returns `Math.ceil(b)`, which is an integer.

DONE.
