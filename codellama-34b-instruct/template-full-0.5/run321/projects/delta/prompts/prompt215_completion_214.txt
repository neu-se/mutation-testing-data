  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` creates a new array by merging the contents of two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 0, other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` adds or removes elements from an array, while `concat()` creates a new array by merging the contents of two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds an element to the end of an array, while `concat()` creates a new array by merging the contents of two or more arrays.

DONE.
