 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with one argument instead of two, potentially causing the code that handles the callback to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an array as its argument, instead of two separate arguments. This could cause issues if the code that handles the callback is not designed to handle an array as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ end: true, data: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an object that has the same properties as the original arguments, but with different values. This could cause issues if the code that handles the callback is expecting specific values for the `end` and `data` properties.

DONE.
