  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` would check if `a` is null, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would check if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== null` would check if `a` is not null, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would check if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` would check if `a` is undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` would check if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
