  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` will always be called with `true` as the first argument, regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` will always be called with `undefined` as the first argument, regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` will always be called with the string `'abc'` as the first argument, regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected.

DONE.
