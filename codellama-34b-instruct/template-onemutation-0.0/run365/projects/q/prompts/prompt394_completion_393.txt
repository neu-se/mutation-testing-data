  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a reference to the value of the promise, while `null` is a literal value that is not a reference to any promise. If the promise is fulfilled with a value, the `null` value would be returned instead of the fulfilled value, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
