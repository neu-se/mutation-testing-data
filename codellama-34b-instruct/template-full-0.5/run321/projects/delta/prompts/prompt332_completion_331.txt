  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method takes an additional `priority` parameter, which would affect the resulting inverted attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(baseOp.attributes, op.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `invert` method's arguments is reversed, which would affect the resulting inverted attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes, !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method's `priority` parameter is negated, which would affect the resulting transformed attributes.

DONE.
