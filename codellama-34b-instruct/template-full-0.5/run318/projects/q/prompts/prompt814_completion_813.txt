  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall` would be called with `promise` as an argument, which would cause the callback to be invoked with `promise` as its argument, rather than being invoked without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall` would be called with `null` as an argument, which would cause the callback to be invoked with `null` as its argument, rather than being invoked without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall` would be called without any arguments, which would cause the callback to be invoked without any arguments, rather than being invoked with `promise` as its argument.

DONE.
