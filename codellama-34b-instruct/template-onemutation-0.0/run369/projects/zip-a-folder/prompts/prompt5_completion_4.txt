  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which checks if both operands are truthy. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which checks if either operand is truthy. This means that if `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` is falsy, the replacement code fragment will evaluate to `targetFilePath`, which may have a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
