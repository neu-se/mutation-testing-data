  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it passes the `_writeStream` object as an argument to the `emit` method, which is not present in the original code. This change may cause the `write_close` event to be emitted with a different argument than expected, which could potentially cause issues in the code that listens to this event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it passes the result of the `destroy` method as an argument to the `emit` method, which is not present in the original code. This change may cause the `write_close` event to be emitted with a different argument than expected, which could potentially cause issues in the code that listens to this event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write
