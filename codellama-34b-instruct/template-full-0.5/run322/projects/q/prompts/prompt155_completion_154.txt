  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because `concatedStacks` is a string, and `filterStackString` is a function that expects a string as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.join("\n")` is a string, and `filterStackString` is a function that expects a string as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.pop()` is a string, and `filterStackString` is a function that expects a string as an argument.

DONE.
