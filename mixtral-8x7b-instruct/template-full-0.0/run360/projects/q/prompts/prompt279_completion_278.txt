 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with an argument of `null`, instead of using the original arguments passed to the nodeback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with an array containing the value `1`, instead of using the original arguments passed to the nodeback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with a function as its argument, instead of using the original arguments passed to the nodeback.

DONE.
