  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is a different property than `a['abs']`, and it is not clear what the intention of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the expression, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of the expression, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

DONE.
