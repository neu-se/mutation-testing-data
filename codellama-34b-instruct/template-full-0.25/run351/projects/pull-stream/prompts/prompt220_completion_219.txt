  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not the same as `null`, which is the value that the original code fragment is expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not the same as `null`, which is the value that the original code fragment is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not the same as `null`, which is the value that the original code fragment is expecting.

DONE.
