  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
console.log(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would cause the function to print a message to the console, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the function to throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
return end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `end + 1` would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would return the value of `end` directly.

DONE.
