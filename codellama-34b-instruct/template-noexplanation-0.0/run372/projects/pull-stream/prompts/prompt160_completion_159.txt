  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument, which is different from the original code fragment that passed `null, _value` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `_value` as its argument, which is different from the original code fragment that passed `null, _value` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as its argument, which is different from the original code fragment that passed `null, _value` as arguments.

DONE.
