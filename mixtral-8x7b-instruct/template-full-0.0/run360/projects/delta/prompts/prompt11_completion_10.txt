 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key of a
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `key` is a property key of the `a` object, rather than checking if `key` is an enumerable property of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `key` is an own property of the `a` object, rather than checking if `key` is an enumerable property of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key in Object.prototype.toString.call(a).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `key` is a property of the string representation of the `a` object, rather than checking if `key` is an enumerable property of the `a` object.
