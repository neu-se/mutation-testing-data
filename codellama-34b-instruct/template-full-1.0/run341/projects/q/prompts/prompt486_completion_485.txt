  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking = function() {
    untrackRejection();
    resetUnhandledRejections();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous implementation of `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` would only call `resetUnhandledRejections`, which would reset the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, but not actually stop the tracking. The new implementation also calls `untrackRejection()`, which would stop the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking = function() {
    process.emit("unhandledRejection", null, null);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous implementation of `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` would reset the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, but the new implementation calls `process.emit("unhandled
