  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function than `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when inverting attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.combine
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.combine` is a different function than `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when combining attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.diff` is a different function than `AttributeMap.invert`, and it may not have the same behavior when diffing attributes.

DONE.
