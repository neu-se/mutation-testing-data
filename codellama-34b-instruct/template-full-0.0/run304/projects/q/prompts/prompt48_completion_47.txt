  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter` is a different function than `domain.exit`, and it would cause the domain to be entered again instead of exited.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit()` is a function call, and it would cause the domain to be exited immediately instead of being exited after the task is run.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(task)
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit(task)` is a function call with an argument, and it would cause the domain to be exited with the task as an argument instead of being exited without any arguments.

DONE.
