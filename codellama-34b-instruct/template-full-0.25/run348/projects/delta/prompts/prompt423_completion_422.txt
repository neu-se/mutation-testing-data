  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `index` variable to be subtracted from `offset`, which would result in a negative value if `offset` is greater than `index`. In the original code, `length` is subtracted from `index` to get the correct offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `offset` variable to be subtracted from `index`, which would result in a negative value if `index` is greater than `offset`. In the original code, `length` is subtracted from `index` to get the correct offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
