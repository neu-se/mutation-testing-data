  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split()` returns an array of substrings, whereas `path` is a string. This could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if it relies on the fact that `path` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.toUpperCase()` returns the uppercase version of the string, whereas `path` is a string. This could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if it relies on the case of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.substring(1)` returns the substring of `path` starting from the second character, whereas `path` is a string. This could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results if it relies on the fact that `path`
