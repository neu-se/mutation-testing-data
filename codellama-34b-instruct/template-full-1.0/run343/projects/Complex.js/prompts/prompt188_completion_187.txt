  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different result for the `Math.pow` function when the base is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different result for the `Math.pow` function when the base is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different result for the `Math.pow` function when the base is a negative number.

DONE.
