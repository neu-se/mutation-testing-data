  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver().then(null)` is a promise that resolves to `null`, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns an object.

DONE.
