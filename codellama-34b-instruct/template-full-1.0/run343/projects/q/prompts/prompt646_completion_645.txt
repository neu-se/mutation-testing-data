  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.dispatch` method is never called, and the promised method would never be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.dispatch` method would be called with `this` set to `undefined`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.dispatch` method would be called with the `delete` operator, which would delete the property instead of invoking the method.

DONE.
