  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `for` loop starts at 0, but in this version, it starts at 1, so the loop would skip the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var j = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `i` is undefined, but in this version, `j` is defined as 0, so the loop would start at 0 instead of being undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `for` loop starts at 0, but in this version, it starts at -1, so the loop would iterate one less time than it would in the original code.

DONE.
