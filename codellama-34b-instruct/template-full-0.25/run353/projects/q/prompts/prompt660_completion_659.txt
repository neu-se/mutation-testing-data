  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)` calls the `dispatch` function with the current `this` context and the `arguments` object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this, arguments)` calls the `dispatch` function with the current `this` context and the `arguments` object, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the original function.

DONE.
