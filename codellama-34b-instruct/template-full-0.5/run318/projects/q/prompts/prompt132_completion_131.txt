  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a built-in method that returns a string representation of an object, while `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object in a locale-specific format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a built-in method that returns a string representation of an object, while `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a method that returns the primitive value of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a built-in method that returns a string representation of an object, while `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether an object has a property
