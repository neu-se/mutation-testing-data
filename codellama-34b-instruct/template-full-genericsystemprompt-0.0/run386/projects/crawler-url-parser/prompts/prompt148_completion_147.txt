  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash (/) as a delimiter, while the new code fragment uses the backslash (\\) as a delimiter. This would cause the split() method to produce different results, leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the forward slash (/) as a delimiter, while the new code fragment uses the forward slash (/) as a delimiter. This would cause the split() method to produce different results, leading to different behavior in the program.
