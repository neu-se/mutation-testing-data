  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
team.members.remove(x => x === null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to the `remove` method would no longer check for null or undefined values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
team.members = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the team's members list would be emptied instead of removing only the null and undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
team.members = team.members.filter(x => x !== null && x !== undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the team's members list would be filtered to only include non-null and non-undefined values, rather than removing null and undefined values from the list.

DONE.
