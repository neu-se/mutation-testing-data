  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
index += 1;
</code
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index value by 1, which would affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
index = 0;
</code
This would result in different behavior because it would set the index value to 0, which would cause the code to access the first element in the array, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
index -= 1;
</code
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index value by 1, which would cause the code to access the previous element in the array, which may not be intended.

DONE.
