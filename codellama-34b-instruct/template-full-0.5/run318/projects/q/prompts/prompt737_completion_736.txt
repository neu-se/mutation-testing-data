  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is 0, but this replacement code fragment checks if the length is greater than 0. This would cause the `any` function to return a rejected promise if the `promises` array contains at least one rejected promise, instead of returning a resolved promise with the value of the first resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `promises` array is 0, but this replacement code fragment checks if the length is 1. This would cause the `any` function to return a resolved promise with the value of the first resolved promise if the `promises` array contains only one promise, instead of returning a rejected promise if the `promises` array contains at least one rejected promise.
