  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PAGEURL.path.replace(/^/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give a different value for the "pageurl_path" variable, which is used in the "gettype" function to compare the URL paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
LINKURL.path.substring(0, LINKURL.path.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give a different value for the "pageurl_path" variable, which is used in the "gettype" function to compare the URL paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PAGEURL.path.split('/').indexOf(LINKURL.path.split('/').length - 1) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would give a different value for the "pageurl_path" variable, which is used in the "gettype" function to compare the URL paths.
