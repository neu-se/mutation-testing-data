  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is undefined. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is undefined. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to `b`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
