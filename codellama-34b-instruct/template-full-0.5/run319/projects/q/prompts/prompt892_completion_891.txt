  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise immediately, rather than forwarding the arguments to the `Q.nfapply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately, rather than forwarding the arguments to the `Q.nfapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, rather than forwarding the arguments to the `Q.nfapply` method.

DONE.
