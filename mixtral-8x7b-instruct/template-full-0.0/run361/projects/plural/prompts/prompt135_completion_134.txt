 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'this'
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the current execution context, instead of the `word` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the first rule's pattern, regardless of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite recursion, as it calls the `plural` function within itself.

DONE.
