  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledRejection` is a different function than `onUnhandledError`, and it may have different behavior when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledException
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledException` is a different function than `onUnhandledError`, and it may have different behavior when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledFailure
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledFailure` is a different function than `onUnhandledError`, and it may have different behavior when it is called.

DONE.
