  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `options.reviver`, which could change the result of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `options.reviver` by 2, which could change the result of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert `options.reviver` to a string, which could change the result of the `JSON.parse()` method.

DONE.
