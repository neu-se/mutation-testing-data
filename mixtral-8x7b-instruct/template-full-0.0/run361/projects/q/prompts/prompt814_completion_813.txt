 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback.fcall` is missing the parentheses to actually call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` is just a reference to the `apply` function, not actually invoking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` is a function that returns a random number between 0 and 1, not related to the original functionality of invoking the `callback`.

DONE.
