  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `part` string matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. By replacing it with `part.match(/:.+/) === null`, we are checking if the `part` string does not match the pattern, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== part.match(/:.+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `part` string matches the pattern `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. By replacing it with `part.match(/:.+/) !== part.match(/:.+/)`, we are checking if the `part` string does not match the pattern, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.
