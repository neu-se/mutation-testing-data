  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is a function call, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This code fragment assigns the value `true` to the property `isInfinite` of the object `this`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; }
```
This code fragment assigns a function to the property `isInfinite` of the object `this`, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
