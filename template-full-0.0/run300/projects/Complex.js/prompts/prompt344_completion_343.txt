  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `b + 1` expression, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `a + b` expression, which is a different value.

DONE.
