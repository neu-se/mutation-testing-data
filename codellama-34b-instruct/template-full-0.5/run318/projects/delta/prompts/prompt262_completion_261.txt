  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation, which may not be the same as the attributes of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the retain value of the current operation, which may not be the same as the attributes of the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the retain value of the other operation, which may not be the same as the attributes of the current operation.

DONE.
