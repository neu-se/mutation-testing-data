  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) will only return true if both `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK` are true, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) will return true if either of the two is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) will only return true if one of `fs.constants.R_OK` or `fs.constants.W_OK` is true, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) will return
