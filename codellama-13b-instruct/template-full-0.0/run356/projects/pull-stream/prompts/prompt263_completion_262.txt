  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the `data` argument. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting the callback to be called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with the `data` argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with only the `data` argument. This could cause the test to fail if the test is expecting the callback to be called with the `data` argument and no other arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with the `data` argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the `data` argument twice. This could cause the
