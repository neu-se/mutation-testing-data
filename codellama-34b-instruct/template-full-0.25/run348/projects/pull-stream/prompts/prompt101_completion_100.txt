  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `null` instead of `err` when `err` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `err` instead of `null` when `err` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with `err` instead of `null` when `err` is `false`.

DONE.
