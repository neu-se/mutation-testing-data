  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re']) && isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either the real or imaginary part of the complex number is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if both parts are NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re']) || isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either the real or imaginary part of the complex number is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if both parts are NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re']) && isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either the real or imaginary part of the complex number is NaN, while this new code fragment checks if both parts are NaN.

DONE.
