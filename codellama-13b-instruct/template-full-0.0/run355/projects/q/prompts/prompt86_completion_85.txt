  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `call` function, while the buggy code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `call` function with the `this` argument set to `undefined`. This would cause the `call` function to be called with a different `this` value, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `call` function, while the buggy code fragment uses the `call` method to call the `call` function. This would cause the `call` function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `call
