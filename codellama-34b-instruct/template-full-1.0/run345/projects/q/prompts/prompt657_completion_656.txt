  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not an array and will throw an error when an array method like `map` is called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not an array and will throw an error when an array method like `map` is called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because 1 is not an array and will throw an error when an array method like `map` is called on it.

DONE.
