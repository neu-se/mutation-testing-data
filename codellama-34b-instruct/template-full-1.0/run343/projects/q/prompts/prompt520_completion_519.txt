  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a rejected promise with the provided `value`, instead of resolving the promise returned from `coerce`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return an undefined value, instead of resolving the promise returned from `coerce`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the generator to return a rejected promise with the provided `error`, instead of resolving the promise returned from `coerce`.

DONE.
