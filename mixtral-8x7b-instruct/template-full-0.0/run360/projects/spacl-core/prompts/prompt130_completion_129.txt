 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 1; index < count; index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `index` by 2 instead of 1, causing it to skip every other iteration of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `index` is less than or equal to `count`, which would cause an extra iteration, potentially accessing an undefined array element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const max = count - 1; index = 0; index < max; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `max` to `count - 1` and checks if `index` is less than `max`, effectively excluding the last element of the array from the iteration.

DONE.
