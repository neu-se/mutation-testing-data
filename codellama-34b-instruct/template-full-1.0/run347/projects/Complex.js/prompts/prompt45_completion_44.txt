  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` together, rather than checking their data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate `a`, rather than checking its data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `b` from `a`, rather than checking their data types.

DONE.
