  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method that returns the first resolved promise, whereas `all` returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of states for the respective values, whereas `all` returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises that are either fulfilled or rejected, whereas `all` returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values.

DONE.
