  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the result would be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle of the result would be changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the magnitude of the result would be changed.

DONE.
