  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of property values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of property name and value pairs, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` does a shallow copy of properties from one object to another, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of property names.

DONE.
