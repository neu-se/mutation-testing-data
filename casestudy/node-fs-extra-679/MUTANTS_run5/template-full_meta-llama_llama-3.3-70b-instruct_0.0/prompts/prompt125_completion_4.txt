Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an error, instead of calling the callback with no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, srcStat)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `srcStat` to the callback, instead of not passing any value, which could cause issues if the calling code expects no value or a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cb(null, { srcStat: null, destStat: null })
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an object with `srcStat` and `destStat` set to `null` to the callback, instead of not passing any value, which could cause issues if the calling code expects no value or a different value.

DONE.
