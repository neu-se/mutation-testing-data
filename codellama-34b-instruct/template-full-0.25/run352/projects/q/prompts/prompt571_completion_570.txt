  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the `makeGenerator` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, whereas `apply` and `call` call the function with a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different context than `this`, and it would change the way the `makeGenerator` function is called.

DONE.
