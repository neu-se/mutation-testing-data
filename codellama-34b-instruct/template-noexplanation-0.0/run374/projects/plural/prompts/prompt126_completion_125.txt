  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined || num === 0
```
This change will ensure that the function returns the correct plural form for words that end in -s, even if the input number is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined || num === -1
```
This change will ensure that the function returns the correct plural form for words that end in -s, even if the input number is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === undefined || num === Infinity
```
This change will ensure that the function returns the correct plural form for words that end in -s, even if the input number is Infinity.

DONE.
