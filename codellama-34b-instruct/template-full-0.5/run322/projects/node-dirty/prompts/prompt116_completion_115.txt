  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `size` property would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be used instead of the `size` property, which could cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would be used to get the number of keys in the `this._data` object, which could cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value.

DONE.
