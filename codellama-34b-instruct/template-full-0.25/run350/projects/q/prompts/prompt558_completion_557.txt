  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument passed to the `continuer` function, which is the value of the yield expression, while the replaced code fragment uses `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument passed to the `continuer` function, which is the value of the yield expression, while the replaced code fragment uses `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument passed to the `continuer` function, which is the value of the yield expression, while the replaced code fragment uses `0` instead.

DONE.
