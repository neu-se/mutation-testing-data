  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the negation of `Number.isFinite`, which means that it will return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` if it is. In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number, so replacing it with its negation will cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is used to check if the argument is NaN (Not a Number), which is different from checking if it is a finite number. In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number, so replacing it with `Number.isNaN` will cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.
