  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `function_slice` would refer to a different function than `array_slice`, leading to a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to `array_slice` would be a subset of the original slice, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` is used to capture the arguments passed to a function, whereas `array_slice()` is used to retrieve a portion of an array.

DONE.
