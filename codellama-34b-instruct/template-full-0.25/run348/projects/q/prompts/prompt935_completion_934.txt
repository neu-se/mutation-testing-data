  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.call(arguments, 2)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(arguments, [2])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(arguments, [2])` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, while `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object starting from the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2).slice(1)`
