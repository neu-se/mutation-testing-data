  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Empty row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the row is empty, rather than corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Invalid row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the row is invalid, rather than corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(`Database corrupted: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the entire database is corrupted, rather than just the row at the end.

DONE.
