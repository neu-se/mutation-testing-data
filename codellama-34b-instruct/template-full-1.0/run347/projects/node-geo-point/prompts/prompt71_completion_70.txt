  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
// Normalize bearing to between -180 and 180 degrees
const θ = (<PLACEHOLDER> + 180) % 360 - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would normalize the bearing to between -180 and 180 degrees, which is different from the original behavior of normalizing to between 0 and 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const θ = deg2rad(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the bearing from degrees to radians, which would affect the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const θ = rad2deg(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the bearing from radians to degrees, which would affect the calculation of the destination point.
