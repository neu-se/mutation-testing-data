Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter used to split the path, which could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs that use forward slashes ("/") as path separators, resulting in unexpected behavior in URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
","
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a comma as the delimiter for splitting the path, which is not a valid path separator in URLs. This would likely cause all parts of the URL to be treated as a single segment, leading to incorrect URL handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a space as the delimiter for splitting the path, which is not appropriate for URL paths. This would cause the URL parts to be incorrectly parsed, potentially leading to invalid or malformed URLs.

DONE.
