  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for strictly less than -180 or strictly greater than 180, while this code checks for less than or equal to -180 or greater than or equal to 180, which would include the value -180 and 180, which are not valid longitude values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude != -180 && longitude != 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for strictly less than -180 or strictly greater than 180, while this code checks for any value that is not equal to -180 or 180, which would include the value -180 and 180, which are not valid longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude >
