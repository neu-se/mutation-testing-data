  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `this`, refers to the String object, whereas `null` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `this`, refers to the String object, whereas `undefined` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `this`, refers to the String object, whereas `"foo"` would not.

DONE.
