 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.denodeify.apply` call would receive `null` as the first argument instead of the expected `this` value, causing the function to not bind the method to the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.denodeify.apply` call would receive `true` as the first argument instead of the expected `this` value, causing the function to not bind the method to the correct object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.denodeify.apply` call would receive a newly created deferred object instead of the expected `this` value, causing the function to not bind the method to the correct object and also creating an unnecessary deferred object.

DONE.
