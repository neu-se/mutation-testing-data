  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a stream or stream of streams, but with `null` it will cause the `nextStream` function to be called, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a stream or stream of streams, but with `undefined` it will cause the `nextStream` function to be called, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a stream or stream of streams, but with `true` it will cause the `nextStream` function to be called, which would result in an error.

DONE.
