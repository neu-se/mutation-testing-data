Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
; index <= length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the loop to access an out-of-bounds index, potentially leading to an `undefined` value being processed, which could cause unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
; index < length + 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively increases the loop's upper limit, allowing it to attempt to access an index that is one past the last valid index, which could lead to processing an `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
; index < length - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because it reduces the number of iterations by one, causing the last element of the array to be skipped during processing, which could lead to incomplete results.

DONE.
