  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be a value, but `null` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be a value, but `undefined` is a special value that indicates an uninitialized or non-existent variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be a value, but `data + 1` is a different value.

DONE.
