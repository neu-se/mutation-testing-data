  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, while `thisp, arguments` is a comma-separated expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` is a binary operator that performs addition, while `thisp, arguments` is a comma-separated expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, while `thisp, arguments` is a comma-separated expression.

DONE.
