  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb || function () {}` uses short-circuit evaluation to return `cb` if it is truthy, and `function () {}` otherwise. However, the new code fragment `function () {}` always returns a new function, which is not the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
