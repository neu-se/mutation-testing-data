  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with a specified value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a specified reason. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to resolve with `TimeoutError` instead of rejecting with it, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a specified reason. Using `throw` instead of `reject` would cause the program to throw an exception, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that takes a reason as an argument, whereas `reject` with no arguments would reject the promise
