  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(/^$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^$/` matches any empty string, which would cause the `matches` method to always return `true`, regardless of the input path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/` matches any string that contains only letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens, which would cause the `matches` method to only return `true` for paths that contain only these characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/i` matches
