  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be incremented by 1, which could cause issues if the value is used in a subsequent operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) - 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be decremented by 1, which could cause issues if the value is used in a subsequent operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) * 2}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `val` property would be multiplied by 2, which could cause issues if the value is used in a subsequent operation.

DONE.
