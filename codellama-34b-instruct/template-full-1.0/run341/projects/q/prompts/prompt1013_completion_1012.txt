  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. So, in this case, using `unshift` would cause the callback to be passed to the function at a different position than it was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes and returns the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. So, in this case, using `pop` would cause the callback to be removed from the array and not passed to the function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes and returns the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. So, in this case, using `shift` would cause the callback
