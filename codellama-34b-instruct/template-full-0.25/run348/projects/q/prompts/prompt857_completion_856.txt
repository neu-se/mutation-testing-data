  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and would not clear the timeout set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout than the one set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function () {}, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new timeout with a different callback function and a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than clearing the existing timeout.

DONE.
