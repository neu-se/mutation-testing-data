  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "1" to the end of the stackLine, which could potentially cause the regular expression matches to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a substring from the stackLine starting from the second character, which could potentially remove the important information from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the entire stackLine to uppercase, which could potentially cause the regular expression matches to fail.

DONE.
