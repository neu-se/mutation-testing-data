 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'toString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `object_toString` function to be called in the `object_keys` function, instead of checking if the current property is an own property of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate 10 times, regardless of the number of properties on the object. This would likely result in an incorrect set of keys being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate a random number of times, based on the result of `Math.random()`. This would likely result in an incorrect set of keys being returned.

DONE.
