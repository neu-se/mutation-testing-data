  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Timeout"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise with the error object passed to the `timeout` method, while this code fragment would reject the promise with a new error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise with the error object passed to the `timeout` method, while this code fragment would resolve the promise with the value passed to the `timeout` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise with the error object passed to the `timeout` method, while this code fragment would notify the promise with the value passed to
