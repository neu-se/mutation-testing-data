  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `places || 0` uses a logical OR operator to provide a default value of 0 when `places` is undefined or null, whereas `a < b` would result in a comparison of `a` and `b` that may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ^ b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `places || 0` uses a logical OR operator to provide a default value of 0 when `places` is undefined or null, whereas `a ^ b` would result in a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b` that may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `places || 0` uses a logical OR operator to provide a default value of 0 when `places` is
