  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the `i` variable by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to iterate over the same elements multiple times or to skip over certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the `i` variable to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to iterate over the same elements repeatedly.

DONE.
