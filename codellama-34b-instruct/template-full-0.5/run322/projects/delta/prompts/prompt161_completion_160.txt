  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to be done on the `this` Delta instead of the `other` Delta, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to be done on the `other` Delta with a specific length, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to be done on the `other` Delta with a specific length that is one less than the original length, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
