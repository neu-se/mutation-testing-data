  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, which means that the `retain` property will always be set to `Infinity`, regardless of the value of `length`. This will likely cause the `next` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, which means that the `retain` property will always be set to `length`, regardless of the value of `length`. This will likely cause the `next` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, which means that the `retain` property will always be set to `length`, regardless of the value of `length`. This will
