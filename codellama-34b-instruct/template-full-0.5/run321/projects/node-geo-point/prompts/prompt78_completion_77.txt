  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1 * cosδ` term would be calculated first, which would result in a different value than the original `sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ` expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosφ1` term would be multiplied by `sinδ` instead of `cosδ`, which would result in a different value than the original `sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinθ` term would be added instead of `cosθ`, which would result in a different value than
