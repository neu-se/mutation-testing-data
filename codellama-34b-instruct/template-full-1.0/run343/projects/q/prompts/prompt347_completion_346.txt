  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when the `rejected` function is defined, even if `rejected` was not called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.called
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the `rejected` function was called, even if `rejected` was not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "function" && rejected.called
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` only if the `rejected` function was defined and called. It is a combination of the two previous options.

DONE.
