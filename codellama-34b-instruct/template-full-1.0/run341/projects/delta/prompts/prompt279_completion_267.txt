  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this would increase the length of the operation, potentially causing the operation to incorrectly apply to a different part of the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because this would decrease the length of the operation, potentially causing the operation to incorrectly apply to a different part of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because this would double the length of the operation, potentially causing the operation to incorrectly apply to a different part of the document.

DONE.
