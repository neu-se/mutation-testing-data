  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is not set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the non-deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` option, even if it is not set to `true` or `false`.

DONE.
