Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly replace paths that end with "index" files instead of "default" files, potentially altering the intended URL structure and leading to incorrect path handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the replacement string from a simple '/' to '/index.html', which could lead to URLs that point to a specific file rather than a directory, affecting how the application resolves paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/home'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the "default" file with a static path '/home', which may not correspond to the actual structure of the URLs being processed, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolutions.

DONE.
