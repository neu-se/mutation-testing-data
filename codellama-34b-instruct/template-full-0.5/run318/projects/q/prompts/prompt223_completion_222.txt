  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `promise` variable to be assigned `null`, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `promise` variable to be assigned `undefined`, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function is used to create a new object with the `Promise.prototype` as its prototype. Replacing it with an empty object `{}` would
