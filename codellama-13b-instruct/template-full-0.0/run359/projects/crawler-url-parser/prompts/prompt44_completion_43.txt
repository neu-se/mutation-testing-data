  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` for any URL that is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for any URL that is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would throw a `TypeError` for any URL that is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for any URL that is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` for any URL that is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for any URL that is not a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL.

DONE.
