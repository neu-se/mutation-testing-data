  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the promise returned by `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)`, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).done(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is not called on the promise returned by `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)`, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the promise returned by `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)`, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected
