  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is not the same as the `abs` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is not the same as the `abs` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is not the same as the `abs` property.

DONE.
