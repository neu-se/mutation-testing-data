  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while this replacement would leave it intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the query string from the URL, while this replacement would leave it intact.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + currentUrlStr.replace(/^#+/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while this replacement would add it back in.

DONE.
