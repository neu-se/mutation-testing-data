  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` have different function definitions, and the produced value would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value, whereas `Math.exp` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.re` refers to the real part of the complex number, whereas `Math.exp` produces the exponential of a number.

DONE.
