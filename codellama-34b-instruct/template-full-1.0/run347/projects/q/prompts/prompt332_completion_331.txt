  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve([result])
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a given value, but `resolve([result])` would resolve the promise with an array containing the value instead of just the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason, but `reject(result)` would reject the promise with the value instead of a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(Promise.reject(result))
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a given value, but `resolve(Promise.reject(result))` would resolve the promise with a rejected promise containing the value instead of just the value.

DONE.
