  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` element would be used instead of `ref[0]`, which could cause the function to behave differently if the array is not in the expected order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[0]` element would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to behave differently if the array is not in the expected order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[0]` element would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the function to behave differently if the array is not in the expected order.

DONE.
