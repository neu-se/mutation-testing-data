  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the array, which is the file name, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the array, which is undefined, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the array, which is the entire string, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

DONE.
