 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable will always be set to the value of the `end` parameter, potentially causing the function to terminate prematurely or continue when it should have stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = test(data) && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable will only be set to `true` if both the `test(data)` condition is true and the `end` parameter is true, potentially causing the function to continue even after it should have stopped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = ended || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ended` variable will be set to `true` if either the `ended` variable is true or the `test(data)` condition is true, potentially causing the function to stop prematurely or continue when it should have stopped.
