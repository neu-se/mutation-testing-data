 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be returned instead of the input promises array, which changes the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null would be returned instead of the input promises array, causing errors in further processing of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current promise context, which is not the same as the input promises array, causing errors in further processing of the function.

DONE.
