Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.slug || '').toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string if `data.slug` is null or undefined, instead of using `data.title` as a fallback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.title || data.slug).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize `data.title` over `data.slug`, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if `data.slug` is null or undefined, instead of using `data.title` as a fallback or returning an empty string.

DONE.
