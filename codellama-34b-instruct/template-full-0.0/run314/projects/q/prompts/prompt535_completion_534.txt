  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the code to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` argument is missing, which could cause the code to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` argument is `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
