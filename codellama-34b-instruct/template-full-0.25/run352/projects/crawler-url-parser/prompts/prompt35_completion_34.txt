  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the modified code fragment is an array of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the modified code fragment is a string with all characters in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string with the protocol "http", while the modified code fragment is a string with the protocol "https".

DONE.
