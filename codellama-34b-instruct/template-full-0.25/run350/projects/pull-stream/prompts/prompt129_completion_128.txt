  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with a different number of arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with one argument, but in this modified code, it is called with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with a different set of arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with the argument `null`, but in this modified code, it is called with the argument `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with a different number of arguments. In the original code, `cb` is called with one argument, but in this modified code, it is called with no arguments.

DONE.
