  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled, even if it was actually rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled, even if it was actually still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, even if it was actually fulfilled with a different value.

DONE.
