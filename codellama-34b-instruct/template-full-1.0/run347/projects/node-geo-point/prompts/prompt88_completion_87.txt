  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos2
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos2` is not a valid JavaScript function, and using it would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a different trigonometric function than `cos`, and using it would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(x) * cos(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(x) * cos(y)` is a different expression than `cos`, and using it would produce a different result.

DONE.
