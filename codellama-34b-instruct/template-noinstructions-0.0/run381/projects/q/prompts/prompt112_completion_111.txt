  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, index, value, self)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function would be different, which could cause unexpected results if the callback function relies on a specific order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, self, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function would be different, which could cause unexpected results if the callback function relies on a specific order of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not receive the `self` argument, which could cause unexpected results if the callback function relies on the `self` argument.

DONE.
