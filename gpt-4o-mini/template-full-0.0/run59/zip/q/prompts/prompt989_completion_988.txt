Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses the `Array.prototype.slice` method, which may not handle the `arguments` object in the same way as `array_slice`, potentially leading to unexpected results if `array_slice` has custom behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the third argument instead of slicing the `arguments` object, which would lead to an error if there are fewer than three arguments provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different context for the `slice` method, which may not behave identically to `array_slice`, especially if `array_slice` has been defined to handle specific cases or types differently.

DONE.
