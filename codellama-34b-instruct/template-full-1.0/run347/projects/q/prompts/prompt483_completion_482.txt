  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, -1
```
This would result in the unhandledReasons array being spliced starting from the last element, while the unhandledRejections array is spliced starting from the first element, leading to different array lengths and potentially missed errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, Infinity
```
This would result in the unhandledReasons array being spliced starting from the first element, while the unhandledRejections array is spliced starting from the last element, leading to different array lengths and potentially missed errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, Math.random()
```
This would result in the unhandledReasons array being spliced at a random starting point, while the unhandledRejections array is spliced at the same starting point, leading to differences in the spliced arrays and potentially missed errors.

DONE.
