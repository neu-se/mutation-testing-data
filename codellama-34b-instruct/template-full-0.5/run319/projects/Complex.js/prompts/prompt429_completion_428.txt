  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
11, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the base of the logarithm would be 11 instead of 10, which would cause the calculation to be off by a factor of 11.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the default value of 1 would be used for `places` instead of 0, which would cause the calculation to be off by a factor of 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `places` would be increased by 1, which would cause the calculation to be off by a factor of 10.

DONE.
