  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last reported unhandled rejection instead of the one at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first reported unhandled rejection instead of the one at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[atReport - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the wrong reported unhandled rejection.

DONE.
