  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is `undefined`. If `name` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or `''`), the original code would still return `null`, while this new code would return the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is `null`. If `name` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `''`), the original code would still return `null`, while this new code would return the object.
