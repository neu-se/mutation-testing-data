  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to always return `Complex['INFINITY']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to always return `Complex['NAN']`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` function to return `Complex['ZERO']` when the input values are both zero, but return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the input values are both infinite.

DONE.
