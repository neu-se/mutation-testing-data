Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the keys of `a` instead of `b`, potentially leading to incorrect differences being reported when `a` and `b` have different structures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first key of `b` for comparison, ignoring all other keys and potentially missing significant differences between `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` values in `b` as equal to values in `a`, which could lead to incorrect results when `null` is a valid value in the comparison.

DONE.
