 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => !data % test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the modulo operator instead of a logical NOT operator, which would always return `false` as any number modulo 1 will result in a number between 0 and 1, converted to a boolean value is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => !test(data + 1)
