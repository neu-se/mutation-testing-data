 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new URL` creates a `URL` object, while `URL.parse` returns an object with parsed URL properties. This change may cause the code to fail if it expects the `URL` object methods to be available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.parse` is the Node.js core module's function, while `URL.parse` is a static method of the `URL` class. This change may cause the code to fail if it relies on the `URL` class's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly references the `URL` class from the global scope, which may
