  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method is added, which would cause the regular expression to always match lowercase letters, even if the input string contains uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods are added, which would cause the regular expression to always match the string in reverse order, even if the input string is not reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^
