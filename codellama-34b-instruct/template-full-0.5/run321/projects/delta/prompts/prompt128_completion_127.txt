  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be off by one, causing the loop to skip the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be off by one, causing the loop to skip the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be off by a factor of two, causing the loop to skip every other element of the array.

DONE.
