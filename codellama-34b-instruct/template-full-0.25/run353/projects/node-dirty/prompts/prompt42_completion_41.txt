  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is simply returning the value of `val`, while the mutated code fragment is returning the value of `val` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is simply returning the value of `val`, while the mutated code fragment is returning `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is simply returning the value of `val`, while the mutated code fragment is returning `null`.

DONE.
