  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream instead of using the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream with an empty file name, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream with a null file name, which would cause an error.

DONE.
