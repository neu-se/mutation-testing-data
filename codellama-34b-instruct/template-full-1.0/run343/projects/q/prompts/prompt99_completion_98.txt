  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the loop condition would always be true, as the index would never exceed the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in an empty loop body because the loop condition would always be false, as the index would always be less than or equal to the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 1
```
This would result in a decrementing loop counter, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely if the initial value of the index is greater than or equal to the length.

DONE.
