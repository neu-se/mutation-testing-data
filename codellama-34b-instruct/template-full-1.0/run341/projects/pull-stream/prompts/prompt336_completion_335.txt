  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would increment the `data` variable, which could cause the test to fail if it was not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would decrement the `data` variable, which could cause the test to fail if it was not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the `data` variable, which could cause the test to fail if it was not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
