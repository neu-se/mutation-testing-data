  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pre"
```
This would result in different behavior because "pre" is a different event type than "post", and the event handler for "pre" may have a different implementation than the event handler for "post".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different event type than "post", and the event handler for "send" may have a different implementation than the event handler for "post".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"npost"
```
This would result in different behavior because "npost" is a different event type than "post", and the event handler for "npost" may have a different implementation than the event handler for "post".

DONE.
