  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` followed by any characters until the end of the string with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` followed by any characters until the end of the string with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a question mark.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` followed by any characters until the end of the string with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with an exclamation mark.

DONE.
