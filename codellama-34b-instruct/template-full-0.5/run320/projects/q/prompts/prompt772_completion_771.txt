  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function (promise) {
    return when(promise, noop, noop);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`, which would cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function (promise) {
    return when(promise, function () {
        throw new Error("Promise rejected");
    });
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called with a different error message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function (promise) {
    return when(promise, function () {
        return Q.reject("Promise rejected");
