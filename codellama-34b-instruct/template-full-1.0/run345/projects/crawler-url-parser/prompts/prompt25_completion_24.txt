  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ABC"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original value with a string literal, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original value with a random number, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the value of the variable, which would cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
