  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be incremented by 1, which could cause unexpected results if the code relies on the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be doubled, which could cause unexpected results if the code relies on the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value stored in the database would be converted to uppercase, which could cause unexpected results if the code relies on the original case.

DONE.
