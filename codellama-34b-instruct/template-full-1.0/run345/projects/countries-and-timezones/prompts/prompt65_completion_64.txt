  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would return a new string with all characters in uppercase, which may not match the original id.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+1` operator would add 1 to the id, which would make it mismatch the actual id stored in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries["Country" + id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `"Country" + id` string would create a new key that is not present in the `countries` object, which would result in a `undefined` value.

DONE.
