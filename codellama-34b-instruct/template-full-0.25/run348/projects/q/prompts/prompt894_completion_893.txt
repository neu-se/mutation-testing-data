  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed array, which would likely cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.pop()` would remove the last element of the array, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results if the array is used later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.shift()` would remove the first element of the array, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results if the array is used later in the code.

DONE.
