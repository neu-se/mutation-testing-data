  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the first item from the array, rather than the item at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the third item from the array, rather than the item at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the last item from the array, rather than the item at the specified index.

DONE.
