  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the source of the data being pulled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pull data through the first through.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push data to the first sink.

DONE.
