  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object, whereas the original code fragment uses the existing `err` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null error object, whereas the original code fragment uses a non-null error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an undefined error object, whereas the original code fragment uses a defined error object.

DONE.
