  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code fragment calculates the distance between the current index and the offset, while `index * 2` calculates the double of the index, which is not related to the distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code fragment calculates the distance between the current index and the offset, while `length + index` calculates the sum of the length and the index, which is not related to the distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the current code fragment calculates the distance between the current index and the offset, while `offset - length` calculates the difference between the offset and the length, which is not related to the distance.

DONE.
