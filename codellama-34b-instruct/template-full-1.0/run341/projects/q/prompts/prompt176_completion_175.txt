  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "null". This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is used to join an array of strings into a single string, and it would produce a different output if the array contained null instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "''". This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is used to join an array of strings into a single string, and it would produce a different output if the array contained an empty string instead of a newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with " ";. This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is used to join an array of strings into a single string, and it would produce a different output if the array contained a space character instead of a newline character.

DONE.
