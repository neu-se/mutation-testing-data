  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from less than to greater than, which would cause the function to return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from less than to equal to, which would cause the function to return a different result if the two values are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from less than to addition, which would cause the function to return a different result if the two values are added together.

DONE.
