 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop in certain conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the previous operation, which is not equivalent to the next operation in the sequence. This could lead to incorrect diff results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object instead of the next operation. This would cause the diff algorithm to break, as it relies on the correct operation being returned.

DONE.
