  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code fragment uses 'https://' to replace the protocol. This would cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code fragment uses 'http://' to replace the protocol. This would cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.
