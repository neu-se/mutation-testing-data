  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'undefined'` would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not an object, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== null` would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not an object, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b !== undefined` would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not an object, regardless of whether it is `undefined` or not.

DONE.
