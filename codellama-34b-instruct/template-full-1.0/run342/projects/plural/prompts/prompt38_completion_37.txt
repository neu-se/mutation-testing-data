  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|numero/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the word "numero" but not the original word "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^aeiouy]y$|quy$)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that end with "y" but not the original word "index".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(^|[^aeiouy])y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words that start with any character except "y" and end with "y", but not the original word "index".

DONE.
