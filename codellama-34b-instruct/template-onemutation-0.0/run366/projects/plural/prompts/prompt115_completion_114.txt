  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(["new illness"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the `illnesses` array, while the modified code fragment also includes the string `"new illness"`. The `concat` method returns a new array that is the result of merging the `illnesses` array with the string `"new illness"`, which would cause the test to fail if it is expecting only the original `illnesses` array.
