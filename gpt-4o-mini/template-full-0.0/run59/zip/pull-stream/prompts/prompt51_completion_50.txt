Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `read` variable to `null`, which would cause any subsequent operations that rely on `read` to fail or behave unexpectedly, instead of passing the function `s` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to invoke `s` as a function, which may lead to a runtime error if `s` is not a function, rather than simply assigning the value of `s` to `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation by adding `1` to `s`, which could lead to unexpected results if `s` is not a number, instead of directly assigning `s` to `read`.

DONE.
