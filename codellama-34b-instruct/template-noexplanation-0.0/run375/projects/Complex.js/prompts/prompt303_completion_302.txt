  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This change will cause the `cot` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the cosine instead of the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will cause the `cot` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the tangent instead of the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This change will cause the `cot` function to return the wrong value, as it will use the hyperbolic sine instead of the sine.

DONE.
