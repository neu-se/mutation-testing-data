  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` operator would return `undefined`, causing the following `when` function to be called with `undefined` as its first argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used as the first argument to the `when` function, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the first argument to the `when` function, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
