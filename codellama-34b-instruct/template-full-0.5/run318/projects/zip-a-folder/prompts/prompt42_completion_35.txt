  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(globPart, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method expects a path to a directory, while the `glob` method expects a glob pattern. Using `directory` with a glob pattern would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { cwd: src });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cwd` option specifies the current working directory, which would be different from the original code. This could result in the glob pattern matching different files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { nodir: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodir` option specifies that directories should not be matched. This could result in the glob pattern matching different files.

DONE.
