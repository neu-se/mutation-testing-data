  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `callback` to be a function, but `null` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `callback` to be a function, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `callback` to be a function, but `() => {}` is a function expression that returns an empty object, which is not the same as the original function.

DONE.
