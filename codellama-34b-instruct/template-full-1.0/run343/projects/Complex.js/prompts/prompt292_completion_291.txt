  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator `-` will return the negative value of the variable `a`, which could potentially alter the output of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a + 1` will return the result of adding the value of `a` to 1, which could potentially alter the output of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a * 2` will return the result of multiplying the value of `a` by 2, which could potentially alter the output of the program.

DONE.
