  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is the `undefined` value. In the context of the code fragment, this would cause the `timeout` variable to always be treated as `null`, even if it has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be set to a positive value, which would result in the promise being rejected after a certain amount of time. This would cause different behavior than the original code, which did not have a timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Date.now() - timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the timeout to be set to the current time minus the specified timeout, rather than the specified timeout itself. This would result in a different behavior than the original code, which set the timeout to the specified amount of time.
