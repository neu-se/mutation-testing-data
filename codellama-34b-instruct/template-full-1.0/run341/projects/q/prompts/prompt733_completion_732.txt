  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value.

DONE.
