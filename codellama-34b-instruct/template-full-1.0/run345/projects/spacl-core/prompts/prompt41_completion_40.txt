  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching a different pattern, which could potentially cause the `spec.match` line to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec.length` check is now comparing the length of the `spec` string to a different value, which could potentially affect the outcome of the `super` method call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` and `Math.random` functions are now being used to generate a random boolean value, which could potentially affect the outcome of the `super` method call.

DONE.
