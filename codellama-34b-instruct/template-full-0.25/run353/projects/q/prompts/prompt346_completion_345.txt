  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, but `null` would be passed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, but `undefined` would be passed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an exception object as its argument, but an empty error object would be passed instead.

DONE.
