 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function would immediately return `reject(null)`, bypassing the error handling and potentially masking the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Intentionally introduced error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original error with a new error, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the error message instead of the entire Error object, which could lead to loss of valuable information like the error's stack trace.

DONE.
