  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the message to the console, while this code logs an error message, which may be ignored by some log analyzers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the message to the console, while this code logs a warning message, which may be ignored by some log analyzers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the message to the console, while this code logs an informational message, which may be ignored by some log analyzers.

DONE.
