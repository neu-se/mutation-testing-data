  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `get`, which would cause the function to return a promise for the value or error of the `get` method, rather than the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to return a promise for the value or error of the `post` method with the additional argument, rather than without it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() {}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is called with an additional argument, which would cause the function to return a promise for the value or error of the `post` method with the additional argument, rather than without it.
