  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This change will invert the boolean value of `domain`, which is used as a condition for exiting the domain in the `runSingle` function. If `domain` is truthy, the code will exit the domain, but if it is falsy, it will not. This change will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, and may reveal issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain && false
```
This change will always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `domain`. This will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, and may reveal issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain || true
```
This change will always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `domain`. This will cause the code to behave differently than the original code, and may reveal issues in the test suite.

DONE.
