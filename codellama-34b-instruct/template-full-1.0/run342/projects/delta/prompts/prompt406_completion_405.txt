  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` property is undefined in the `otherData` object, which would cause the `if` condition to fail and the `else` block to be executed, even if `otherData` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData['embedType']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherData['embedType']` property is undefined, which would cause the `if` condition to fail and the `else` block to be executed, even if `otherData` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EmbedType.get(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `EmbedType.get(embedType)` method would return undefined, which would cause the `if` condition to fail and the `else` block to be executed, even if `embedType` is a valid embed type.

DONE.
