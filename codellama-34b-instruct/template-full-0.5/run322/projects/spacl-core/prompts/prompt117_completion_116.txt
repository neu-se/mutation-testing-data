  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.matches(path, ctx) && verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this.matches(path, ctx)`, so if the path does not match the rule, the rule will be applied even if the verb is not allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) || verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator combines the result of `this.matches(path, ctx)` and `verb in this.verbs`, so if either condition is true, the rule will be applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && !(verb in this.verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `verb in this.verbs`, so if the verb is not allowed, the rule will
