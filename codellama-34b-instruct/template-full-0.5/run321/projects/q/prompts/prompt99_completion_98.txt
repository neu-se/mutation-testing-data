  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, and the condition would be met when the index is greater than the length, rather than when it is less than or equal to the length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2; index < length; index -= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every other element in the array, and the condition would be met when the index is greater than the length, rather than when it is less than or equal to the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0; index < length; index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over only the even-indexed elements in the array, and the condition would be met when the index is greater than the length, rather than when it is less than or equal to the length.

DONE.
