  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this replacement uses the `startsWith()` method, which is more concise and easier to read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf('http://') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this replacement uses the `indexOf()` method, which is more concise and easier to read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/^https?:\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this replacement uses the `match()` method, which is more concise and easier to read.

DONE.
