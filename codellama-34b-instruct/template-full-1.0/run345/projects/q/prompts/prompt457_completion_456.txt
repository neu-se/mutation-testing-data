  I don't have enough information to give specific examples. However, in general, the approach to applying mutation testing to find weaknesses in a test suite is as follows:

1. Identify a section of code that is susceptible to a common mutation, such as an if statement or a loop.
2. Introduce a mutation into the code, such as by modifying the condition of the if statement or the loop variable.
3. Run the test suite and observe the results.
4. Depending on the type of mutation introduced, the test suite may pass or fail, or it may produce unexpected results.
5. If the test suite passes after the mutation, it indicates that the test suite may not be effective at catching errors in this area of the code.
6. If the test suite fails after the mutation, it indicates that the test suite may be effective at catching errors in this area of the code, but that additional testing is needed.

It is important to note that mutation testing is not a one-time event, but rather an ongoing process that should be repeated regularly to ensure that the test suite remains effective.
