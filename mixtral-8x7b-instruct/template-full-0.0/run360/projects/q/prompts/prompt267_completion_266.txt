 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be immediately resolved with a rejected reason, instead of rejecting the deferred promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would occur immediately, instead of being deferred until the resolver function has finished executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Replacement error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be thrown, replacing the original reason for rejection.

DONE.
