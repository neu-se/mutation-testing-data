  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `1`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `NaN`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
