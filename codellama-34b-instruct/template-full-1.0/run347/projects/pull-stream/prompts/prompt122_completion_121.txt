  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant value, and the original code fragment `source` is an object with properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string value, and the original code fragment `source` is an object with properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ acc, data }
```
This would result in different behavior because `{ acc, data }` is an object with the properties `acc` and `data`, and the original code fragment `source` is an object with properties and methods.

DONE.
