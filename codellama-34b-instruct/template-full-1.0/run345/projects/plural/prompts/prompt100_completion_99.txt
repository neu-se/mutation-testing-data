  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Â '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string instead of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null instead of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined instead of the original string.

DONE.
