  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of an array, whereas `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift()` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
