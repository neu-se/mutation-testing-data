  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `cb` function with a null error and the transformed data, regardless of whether the `read` function returned an error or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the transformed data as the only argument, regardless of whether the `read` function returned an error or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the transformed data as the second argument, regardless of whether the `read` function returned an error or not.

DONE.
