  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the x-coordinate is missing, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the x-coordinate and y-coordinate are being added together, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
