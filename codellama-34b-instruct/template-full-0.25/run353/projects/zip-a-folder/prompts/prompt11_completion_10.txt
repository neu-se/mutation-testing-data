  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the glob pattern, rather than all parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last part of the glob pattern, rather than all parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').filter((part) => part.includes('*'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider parts of the glob pattern that include a wildcard character, rather than all parts.

DONE.
