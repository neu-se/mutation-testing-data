  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, function progressed() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to pass `undefined` as an argument, whereas this option uses the keyword `undefined` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, function progressed() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to pass `undefined` as an argument, whereas this option uses the `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, 0, function progressed() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `void 0` to pass `undefined` as an argument, whereas this option uses the number `0` value.

DONE.
