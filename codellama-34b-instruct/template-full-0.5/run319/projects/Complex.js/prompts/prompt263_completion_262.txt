  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the result of `Math.atan2`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `Math.atan2` is multiplied by `Math.PI`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
