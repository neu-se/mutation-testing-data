  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of just checking the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['PI']
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking a constant that is not the same as the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
