Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'non-existent-file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to open a non-existent file, which would throw an error, whereas the original code opens the file specified by the `filename` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because it opens the file in write mode instead of read mode, which could lead to unintended modifications to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'r+' // but without checking if the file exists
```
However, a more realistic mutation would be:
```javascript
filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the mode parameter, which could lead to the function using a default mode that is not intended, whereas the original code explicitly specifies the mode as 'r'.

DONE.
