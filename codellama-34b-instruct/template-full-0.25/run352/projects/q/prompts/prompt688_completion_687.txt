  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
