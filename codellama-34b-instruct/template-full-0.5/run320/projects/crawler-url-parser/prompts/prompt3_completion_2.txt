  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` operator always returns a string, so the condition would never be met even if `currentUrlStr` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` operator checks for null or undefined, so the condition would be met if `currentUrlStr` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `===` operator checks for null only, so the condition would be met if `currentUrlStr` is null but not undefined.

DONE.
