  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `cbs` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to an empty array instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
