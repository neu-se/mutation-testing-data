  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing three arguments instead of two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing only one argument instead of two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passing the `nodeArgs` array instead of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
