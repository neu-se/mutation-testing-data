  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<inspected.state === "pending" || inspected.state === "rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for `valueOf` to always be `true` when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(!<inspected.state === "pending" || inspected.state === "rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for `valueOf` to always be `false` when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(inspected.state === "rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for `valueOf` to only be `true` when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
