  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` will return `true` only if `linkurl_path` starts with `pageurl_path`, whereas `includes` will return `true` if `pageurl_path` is anywhere in `linkurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `linkurl_path` is included in `pageurl_path`, whereas the original code checks if `pageurl_path` is included in `linkurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path.includes(pageurl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `pageurl.path` is included in `linkurl.path`, whereas the original code checks if `linkurl_path` includes `page
