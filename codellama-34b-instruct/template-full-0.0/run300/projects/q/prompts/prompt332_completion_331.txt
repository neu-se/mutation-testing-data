  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would cause the promise to be notified, whereas `resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of `reject(exception)`, which would be a rejected promise.

DONE.
