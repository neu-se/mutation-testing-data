Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of arguments instead of slicing the array, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the arguments passed to the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only retrieve the first argument from the array instead of returning a new array containing all the arguments, which could cause the function to fail if multiple arguments are expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(arg => arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the same elements as `args`, but if `args` is not an array, this would throw an error, whereas `array_slice` is designed to handle array-like objects gracefully.

DONE.
