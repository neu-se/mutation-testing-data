  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb === null` is a strict equality check, whereas `!cb` is a negation of the truthiness of `cb`. If `cb` is a function, it will always be truthy, so the negation will always result in `false`. In contrast, `cb === null` will only be true if `cb` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc === null` is a strict equality check, whereas `!cb` is a negation of the truthiness of `cb`. If `acc` is a function, it will always be truthy, so the negation will always result in `false`. In contrast, `acc === null` will only be true if `acc` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink === null
