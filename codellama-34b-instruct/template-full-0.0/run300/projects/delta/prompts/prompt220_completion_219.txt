  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` could be `undefined` even if it is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null && op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if `op.insert` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert != null && op.insert != undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if `op.insert` is not `undefined`.

DONE.
