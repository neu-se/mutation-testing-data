  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code checks if it is not equal to it. This would cause the `if` block to be executed even if the compression level is not `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while this new code checks if it is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`. This would cause the `if` block to be executed only if the compression level is `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the compression level is
