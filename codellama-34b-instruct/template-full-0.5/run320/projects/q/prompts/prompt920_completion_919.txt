  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead, which would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an empty value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }
    return result;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but a function that throws an error if the first argument is not `null
