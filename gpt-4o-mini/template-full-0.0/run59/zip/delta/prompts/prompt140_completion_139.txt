Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to incorrectly handle the case where the operation type is expected to be 'insert', leading to potential incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to always consider the first operation as having a length of 0, which could lead to skipping operations that should be processed, resulting in an incomplete composition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the operation as an 'insert' type regardless of its actual type, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations and unexpected results in the composed delta.

DONE.
