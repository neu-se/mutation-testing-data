  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== false` would allow the policy to pass even if the rule returns `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === true` would allow the policy to pass only if the rule returns `true`, and not if it returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== null` would allow the policy to pass if the rule returns any value other than `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
