  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!== null` check would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `spec` string contains any of the characters in the character class, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` only when the `spec` string does not contain any of those characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=== undefined` check would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `spec` string contains any of the characters in the character class, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true` only when the `spec` string does not contain any of those characters.
