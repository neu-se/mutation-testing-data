 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1 as the real part of the result, regardless of the input value of 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the real part of the complex number when calculating the logarithm, ignoring the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log(Math.abs(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the absolute value of 'a' as the real part of the result, discarding the sign information.

DONE.
