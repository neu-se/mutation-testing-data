  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise, which would be passed to `makeStackTraceLong` instead of the original `error`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` returns a new promise, which would be passed to `makeStackTraceLong` instead of the original `error`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally()` returns a new promise, which would be passed to `makeStackTraceLong` instead of the original `error`.

DONE.
