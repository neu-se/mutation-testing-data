  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0.0 && b === 0.0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0.0 and 0 are not the same value. The original code checks for the exact value of 0, while the mutated code checks for a value that is close to 0 but not exactly 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `a` and `b` are 0, while the mutated code checks if `a` or `b` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` and `b` are both 0, while the mutated code checks if their sum is 0.

DONE.
