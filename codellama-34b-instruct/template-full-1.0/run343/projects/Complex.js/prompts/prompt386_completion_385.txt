  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E` is a constant representing the base of the natural logarithm, whereas the original code fragment `2 * b` would result in the product of `2` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the complex number by `2` instead of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new complex number with the product of `2` and `b` as its real part and `0` as its imaginary part, whereas the original code fragment would produce a complex number with `b` as its real part and `0` as its imaginary part.

DONE.
