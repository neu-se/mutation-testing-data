  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._path
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._path` is a different variable and may not have the same value as `this.path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the value of `this.path` to lowercase, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.replace(/^/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would add a leading slash to the value of `this.path`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
