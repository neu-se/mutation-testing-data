  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JSON value, but `undefined` is not. If `null` is used instead of `undefined`, the `set` method will store the value `null` in the database, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'null'` is a string, not a JSON value. If `'null'` is used instead of `undefined`, the `set` method will store the string `'null'` in the database, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, not a JSON value. If `{}` is used instead of `undefined`, the `set` method will store an empty object in the database, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
