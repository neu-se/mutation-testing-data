  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would skip the first argument to `invoke` and use the second argument instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `0`, which would include the first argument to `invoke` and exclude the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would include the first two arguments to `invoke` and exclude the third argument.

DONE.
