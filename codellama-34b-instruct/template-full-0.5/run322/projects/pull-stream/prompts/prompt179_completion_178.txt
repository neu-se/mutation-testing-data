  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` passes the callback function as an argument to `abortCb`, but replacing it with `null` would pass `null` instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` passes the callback function as an argument to `abortCb`, but replacing it with `undefined` would pass `undefined` instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` passes the callback function as an argument to `abortCb`, but replacing it with `cb(false)` would pass a different callback function that always returns `false`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
