  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `z` is infinite, regardless of the value of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `this` is infinite, regardless of the value of `z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `this` is zero and `z` is infinite, regardless of the value of `z`.

DONE.
