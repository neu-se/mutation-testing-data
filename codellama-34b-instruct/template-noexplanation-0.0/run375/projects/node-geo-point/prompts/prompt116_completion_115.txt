  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(this.latitude + distance, this.longitude + bearing);
```
This code fragment will return a new GeoPoint object with a latitude and longitude that are offset by the distance and bearing values, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(this.latitude * distance, this.longitude * bearing);
```
This code fragment will return a new GeoPoint object with a latitude and longitude that are scaled by the distance and bearing values, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(this.latitude + distance * bearing, this.longitude + distance * bearing);
```
This code fragment will return a new GeoPoint object with a latitude and longitude that are offset by the distance and bearing values, respectively, and then scaled by the distance and bearing values, respectively.

DONE.
