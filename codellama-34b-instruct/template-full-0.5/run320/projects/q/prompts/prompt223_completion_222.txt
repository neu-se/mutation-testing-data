  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `null` is a primitive value that does not have a prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `{}` is a shorthand for creating a new object with no prototype.

DONE.
