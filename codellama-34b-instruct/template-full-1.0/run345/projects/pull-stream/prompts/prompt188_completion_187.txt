  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the same value multiple times, rather than iterating over the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to skip over the first element of the array and return the second element multiple times, rather than iterating over the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[array.length-i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to iterate over the array in reverse order, rather than forward order.

DONE.
