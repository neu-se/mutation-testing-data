  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would clone the rule with the given placeholder, but `rule.clone(null)` would clone the rule with a null placeholder, which would result in a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would clone the rule with the given placeholder, but `rule.clone(undefined)` would clone the rule with an undefined placeholder, which would result in a different object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(new Rule())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which would clone the rule with the given placeholder, but `rule.clone(new Rule
