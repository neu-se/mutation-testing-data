 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is an instance of the built-in `Promise` constructor, rather than the custom `Promise` object in the provided code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Promise]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.prototype.toString` method to check the type of `value`, which may not return the same result as the custom `Promise` object in the provided code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.constructor.name === 'Promise'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the name of the constructor of `value`, which may not be 'Promise' in the case of the custom `Promise` object in the provided code.

DONE.
