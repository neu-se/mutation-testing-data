  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.call` is a different method than `pull.apply`, and it may have different behavior when called with the same arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.bind` is a different method than `pull.apply`, and it may have different behavior when called with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply.bind` is a different method than `pull.apply`, and it may have different behavior when called with the same arguments.

DONE.
