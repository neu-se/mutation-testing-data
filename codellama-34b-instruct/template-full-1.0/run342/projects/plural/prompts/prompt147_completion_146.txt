  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the third element of the `rules` array instead of the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the first element of the `rules` array instead of the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello world'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the string "hello world" instead of the second element of the `rules` array.

DONE.
