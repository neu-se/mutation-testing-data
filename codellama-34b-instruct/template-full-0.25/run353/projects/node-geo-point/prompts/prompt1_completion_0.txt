  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the latitude and longitude are not numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are null. If the latitude or longitude is null, the constructor will throw an error, even if they are valid numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude < 0 || longitude < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the latitude and longitude are less than 0, while this new code fragment checks if they are less than or equal to 0. If the latitude or longitude is equal to 0, the constructor will not throw an error, even if they are invalid numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === 0 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the latitude and longitude are not equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if they are equal
