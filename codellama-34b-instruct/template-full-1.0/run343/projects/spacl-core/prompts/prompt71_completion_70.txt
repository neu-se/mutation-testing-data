  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the action is explicitly allowed, while the modified code fragment checks if the action is explicitly denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'X'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the action equals a specific value, while the modified code fragment checks if the action is equal to a modified value with an appended 'X'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the action is equal to a specific value, while the modified code fragment checks if the action is equal to a modified value with the first character removed.

DONE.
