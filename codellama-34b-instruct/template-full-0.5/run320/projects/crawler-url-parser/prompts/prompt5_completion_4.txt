  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for illegal characters in the hostname of the URL, rather than in the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for illegal characters in the path of the URL, rather than in the entire URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(parsedUrl.search)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for illegal characters in the query string of the URL, rather than in the entire URL.

DONE.
