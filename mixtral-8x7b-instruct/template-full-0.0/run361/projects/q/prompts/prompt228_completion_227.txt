 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element to the beginning of the array, not the end, which could change the order of message processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length of the messages array to 0, effectively clearing it, instead of pushing a new message to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages = [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the messages array with a new array containing only the arguments, instead of pushing the arguments to the existing array.

DONE.
