  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array with all elements except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the `makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([])` would return a new array with all elements of `nodeArgs` followed by an empty array, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the `makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` would return a new array with all elements of `nodeArgs` that are not `undefined`, whereas `nodeArgs` is expected to be an array of arguments to be passed to the
