  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `_read` variable, while the modified code fragment is a function call to the `_read` function. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `_read` function has side effects or if it is not idempotent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `_read` variable, while the modified code fragment is a function call to the `_read` function with the `this` context. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `_read` function has side effects or if it is not idempotent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `_read` variable, while the modified code fragment is
