  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb (key, val) => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(key, val) => { throw new Error("Some error message"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(key, val) => { cb(key, val); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would recurse indefinitely.

DONE.
