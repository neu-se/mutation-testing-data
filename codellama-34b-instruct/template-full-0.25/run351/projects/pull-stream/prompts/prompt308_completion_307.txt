  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, which means that the `cb` function would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `ended` and `!end` are truthy, which means that the `cb` function would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `ended` or `!end` are truthy, which means that the `cb` function would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
