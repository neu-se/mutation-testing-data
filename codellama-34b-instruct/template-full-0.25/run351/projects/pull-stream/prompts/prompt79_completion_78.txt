  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `next()`, which would call the `next` function with no arguments. Replacing it with `next(null)` would call the `next` function with a single argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `next()`, which would call the `next` function with no arguments. Replacing it with `next(undefined)` would call the `next` function with a single argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `next()`, which would call the `next` function with no arguments. Replacing it with `next(true)` would call the `next` function with a single argument, which could potentially
