  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isZero']()` and `z['isZero']()` are both true, while the modified code returns `Complex['ZERO']` in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are both true, while the modified code returns `Complex['INFINITY']` in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns `Complex['NAN']` when `this['isZero']()` and `z['isZero']()` are both true, while the modified code returns `Comple
