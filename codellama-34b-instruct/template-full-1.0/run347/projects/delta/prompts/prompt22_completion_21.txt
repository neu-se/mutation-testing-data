  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!=
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` is a different operator than `===` and would evaluate to true for different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` would negate the result of the `isEqual` function, resulting in a false positive or false negative in the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const equal = !isEqual(a[key], b[key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `isEqual` has been replaced with a constant assignment, and the resulting object would not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
