  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is different from the `a` variable in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the expression to evaluate to a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
