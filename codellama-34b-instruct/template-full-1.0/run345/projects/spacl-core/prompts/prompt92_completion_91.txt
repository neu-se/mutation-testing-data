  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy in policies
```
This would result in different behavior because `in` operator checks if a property is in the object, rather than iterating over the object's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.foreach((policy) => {
  this.set(policy.name, policy);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `foreach` is used to iterate over an array, rather than the `for...of` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i = 0; i < policies.length; i++) {
  this.set(policies[i].name, policies[i]);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable `i` is being used to index into the `policies` array, rather than using the `policy` variable provided by the `for...of` loop.

DONE.
