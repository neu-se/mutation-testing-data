 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the type check for the `test` variable would always return false if `test` is a function, which is the expected type for this variable. This would cause the `last` variable to be set to `true` and a new `test` function to be created, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable would be checked for strict equality with `null`, which would always return false if `test` is a function. This would cause the `last` variable to be set to `true` and a new `test` function to be created, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'number' === typeof
