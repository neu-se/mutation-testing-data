  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the next operation in the iterator, whereas `push` is a method that pushes a new operation onto the iterator. Using `retain` instead of `push` would cause the iterator to retain the next operation, rather than pushing a new one, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
