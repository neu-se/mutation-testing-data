  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given error, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that creates a node-style callback that resolves the promise with the given value.
