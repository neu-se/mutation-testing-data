  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is null.

DONE.
