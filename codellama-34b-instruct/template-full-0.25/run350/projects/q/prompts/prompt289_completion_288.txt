  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` value, whereas the original code simply passes the `resolver` function as a callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` immediately invokes the `resolver` function with `null` as the `this` value, whereas the original code passes the `resolver` function as a callback to be invoked later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` immediately invokes the `resolver` function with `null` as the `this` value and an empty argument list, whereas the original code passes the `resolver` function as a callback to be invoked later with a list of arguments.

DONE.
