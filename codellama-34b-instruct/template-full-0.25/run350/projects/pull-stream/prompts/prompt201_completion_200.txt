  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error. Additionally, the `err` variable is not defined in the original code, so this would also cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error. Additionally, passing `null` as an argument to `abortCb` would cause a different behavior than passing `aborted` as an argument, which is the original behavior.

DONE.
