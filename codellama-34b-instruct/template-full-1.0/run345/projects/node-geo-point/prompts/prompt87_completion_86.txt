  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Δλ = deg2rad(point1.longitude - point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Δλ` would always be 0, causing the calculation of `y` and `x` to also be 0, resulting in a NaN value for `φ2` and `λ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Δλ = deg2rad(point1.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Δλ` would always be the same value, causing the calculation of `y` and `x` to always use the same values, resulting in the same `φ2` and `λ2` values, regardless of the actual coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Δλ = deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Δλ` would always be the opposite sign of what
