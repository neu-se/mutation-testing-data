  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the second element, instead of starting from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the first element, but only include the first element in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the third element, instead of starting from the first element.

DONE.
