  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This change will cause the `cot` function to return the incorrect value, as it will use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This change will cause the `cot` function to return a value that is one unit larger than the correct value, which will result in a test failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This change will cause the `cot` function to return a value that is one unit smaller than the correct value, which will result in a test failure.

DONE.
