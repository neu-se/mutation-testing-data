  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different index for the fourth argument. This could potentially cause a bug if the function is called with a different number of arguments than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with an additional argument at the end. This could potentially cause a bug if the function is not designed to handle the additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different index for the fourth argument. This could potentially cause a bug if the function is called with a different number of arguments than expected.

DONE.
