 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the callback function is reversed, which could cause issues in the code that consumes this module.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data || 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `data` is falsy, it will be replaced with the string 'default' instead of passing `null` as the second argument. This could cause unexpected behavior in the code that consumes this module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{error: null, data: data}
