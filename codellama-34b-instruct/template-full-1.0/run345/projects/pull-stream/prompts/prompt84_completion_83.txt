  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function expects a truthy value as the first argument, but `null` is falsy. If `null` is passed as the first argument, the `abort` function will not work as intended, and the code will likely fail to execute as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function expects a truthy value as the first argument, but `undefined` is falsy. If `undefined` is passed as the first argument, the `abort` function will not work as intended, and the code will likely fail to execute as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function expects a truthy value as the first argument, but `true` is a bolean value and will not work as intended.

DONE.
