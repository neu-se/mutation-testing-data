 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.isInfinite` property exists, while the modified code invokes the (possibly nonexistent) method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.re` property is infinite, while the modified code checks if it is zero (or a very small number, causing a division by zero error).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `this.re` property is infinite, while the modified code always returns false, regardless of the property value.

DONE.
