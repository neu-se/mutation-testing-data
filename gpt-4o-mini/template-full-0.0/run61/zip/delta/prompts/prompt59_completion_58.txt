Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to assign the length of the `ops` array instead of the actual array itself, leading to `this.ops` being set to a number rather than an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign only the first element of the `ops` array to `this.ops`, potentially losing all other operations if there are multiple.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `this.ops` to `null`, which would break any subsequent operations that expect `this.ops` to be an array.

DONE.
