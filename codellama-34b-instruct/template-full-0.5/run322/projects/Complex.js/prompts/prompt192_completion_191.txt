  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `-b` is the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `-b` instead of `b` would cause the resulting complex number to have a different imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b*b` is the square of the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `b*b` instead of `b` would cause the resulting complex number to have a different imaginary part.

DONE.
