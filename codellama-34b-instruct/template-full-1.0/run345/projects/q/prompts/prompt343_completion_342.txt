  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would be called with the rejection exception as its argument, rather than the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would be called with the resolved value as its argument, rather than the rejection exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled callback would not be called with any arguments, rather than the original resolved value or rejection exception.

DONE.
