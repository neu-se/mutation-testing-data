  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `transformPosition` method to be called even when `arg` is a number, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `transform` method, even when `arg` is a number, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg == 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `transformPosition` method only when `arg` is a string that is equal to the string `'number'`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
