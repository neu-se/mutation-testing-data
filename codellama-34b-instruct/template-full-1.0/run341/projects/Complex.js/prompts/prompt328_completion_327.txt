  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the variable `a`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the variable `a`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a^2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the variable `a`, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
