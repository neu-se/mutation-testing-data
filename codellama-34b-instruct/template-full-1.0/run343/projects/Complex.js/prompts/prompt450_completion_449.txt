  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` would return the integer part of the number, while `Math.abs` would return the absolute value of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` would return a boolean indicating whether the number is an integer, while `Math.abs` would return the absolute value of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` would return the square root of the number, while `Math.abs` would return the absolute value of the number.

DONE.
