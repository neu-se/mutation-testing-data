 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key of a
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `key` is a property key of the `a` object, rather than checking if `key` is a property of the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key in Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `key` is a property of the array `Object.keys(a)`, rather than checking if `key` is a property of the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
key === Object.keys(a)[0]
