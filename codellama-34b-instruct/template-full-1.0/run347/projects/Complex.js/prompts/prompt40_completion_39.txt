  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `b` from `a` instead of adding `b` to `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `1` to the result of `a + b` instead of just the result of `a + b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square `b` instead of adding `a` and `b`.

DONE.
