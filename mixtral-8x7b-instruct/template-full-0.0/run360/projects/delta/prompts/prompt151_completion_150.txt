 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the `newOp.retain` property to 0, regardless of the value of `firstOther.retain - firstLeft`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it always adds the values of `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft`, instead of subtracting `firstLeft` from `firstOther.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp.retain` property to a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the expected value of `firstOther.retain - firstLeft`.

DONE.
