  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = (point2.latitude * π) / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function used in the original code fragment is equivalent to multiplying the input angle in degrees by `π/180`, whereas the above code fragment uses the angle in radians directly. This would cause the `calculateDistance` function to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` function now works with the latitude value plus 1, which would cause the `acos` calculation to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = cos(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` function now works with the cosine of the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the `
