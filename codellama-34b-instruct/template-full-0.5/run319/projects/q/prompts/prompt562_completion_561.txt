  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q` creates a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a deferred object, whereas `Q` creates a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async()` creates an asynchronous generator function, whereas `Q` creates a resolved promise.

DONE.
