  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not being checked for truthiness, which could cause the `once` function to be called even if the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being checked for truthiness, but the `abort` variable is not being checked, which could cause the `once` function to be called even if the stream has not been aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` and `abort` variables are both being checked for truthiness, which could cause the `once` function to be called even if the stream has not ended and has not been aborted.

DONE.
