  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'whole', 'wholes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies to the specific case of 'person' and 'people', but the new code fragment would also apply to the word 'whole'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people', 'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would result in the plural form 'people' for the singular form 'person', but the new code fragment would result in the same form for both singular and plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would result in the plural form 'people' for the singular form 'person', but the new code fragment would result in the plural form 'peoples'.

DONE.
