  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `Object.values()` instead of `Object.keys()`. This change can cause the function to return a different set of values, which may not be what the developers intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it returns the length of the array returned by `Object.keys()` instead of the array itself. This change can cause the function to return a different value, which may not be what the developers intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).reverse()
```
This code fragment is different from the original, as it returns the keys of the object in reverse order instead of the original order. This change can cause the function to return a different set of values, which may not be what the developers intended.

DONE.
