  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
a * Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation has different semantics for complex numbers than the hypotenuse operation. The square root operation returns the positive complex number with the specified magnitude, while the hypotenuse operation returns a complex number with real part equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the initial complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Math.log(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logarithm operation has different semantics for complex numbers than the hypotenuse operation. The logarithm operation returns the principal value of the logarithm of a complex number, while the hypotenuse operation returns the hypotenuse of the complex plane triangle formed by the real and imaginary parts of the initial complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would have the same effect as
