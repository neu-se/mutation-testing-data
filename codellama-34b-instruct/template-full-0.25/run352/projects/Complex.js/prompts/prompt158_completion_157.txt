  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` property is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError` when accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
