  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` rounds the number towards zero, whereas `parseFloat` returns the number as a floating point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat(z['re'])` would return the real part of the complex number `z` as a floating point number, whereas `parseFloat` without arguments would return the floating point representation of the number that is passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating point representation of the number.

DONE.
