 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.cosh` would attempt to access the `cosh` property of the current object, while `cosh` is a standalone function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a).add(Math.exp(-a)).divide(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `add` and `divide` methods from the Complex class, while the original code uses arithmetic operators.

DONE.
