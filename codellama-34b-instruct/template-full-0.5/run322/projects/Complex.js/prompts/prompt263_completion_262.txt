  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `b` and `a`, rather than `a` and `b`, which could produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `a`, rather than `a` and `b`, which could produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `a` and `b`, and then add `Math.PI` to the result, which could produce a different result.

DONE.
