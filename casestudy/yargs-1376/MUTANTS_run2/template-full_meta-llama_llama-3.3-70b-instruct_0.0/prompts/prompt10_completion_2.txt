Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defaultConfig
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `defaultConfig` has an 'extends' property instead of `config`, potentially causing incorrect handling of extended configurations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
config.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the string representation of `config` has an 'extends' property, which would likely be incorrect and could cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the current context (`this`) has an 'extends' property, which would likely be incorrect and could cause unexpected behavior or a runtime error.

DONE.
