  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would not be called with the `end` argument, which would cause the `infinite` function to return `undefined` instead of a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the `end` argument, which would cause the `infinite` function to return `null` instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the `end` argument, which would cause the `infinite` function to return `true` instead of a function.

DONE.
