 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called without passing any argument, while in the original code it is assigned to `Q.resetUnhandledRejections`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the implementation of `resetUnhandledRejections` relies on being called as a method of the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 && resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1 && resetUnhandledRejections()` would always evaluate to `resetUnhandledRejections()`, which is the function call. However, the original code does not include this expression, so it would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resetUnhandledRejections = resetUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior
