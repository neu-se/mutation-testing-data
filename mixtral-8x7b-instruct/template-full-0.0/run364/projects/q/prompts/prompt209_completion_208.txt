 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind(null, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original callback is called without any arguments, while the modified version will always pass 1 as the first argument, potentially causing the callee to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback || function(){}
