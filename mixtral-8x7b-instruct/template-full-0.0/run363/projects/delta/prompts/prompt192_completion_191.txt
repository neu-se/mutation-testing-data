 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.hasNext() &&
  isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the previous operation in the delta instead of the last operation, potentially skipping a comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
  isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `otherIter` has an insert operation, which may not accurately reflect the end of the `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
!otherIter.hasNext() &&
  isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], otherIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the last operation in the `
