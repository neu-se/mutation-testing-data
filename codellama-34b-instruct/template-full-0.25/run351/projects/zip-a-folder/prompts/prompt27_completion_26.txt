  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event listener, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not handle the error event, and the code would continue to execute without handling the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', (err) => { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw the error, causing the code to stop executing and the error to be propagated to the caller.

DONE.
