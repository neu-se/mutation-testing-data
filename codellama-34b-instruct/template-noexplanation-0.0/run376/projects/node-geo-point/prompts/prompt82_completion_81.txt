  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ;
```
This code fragment is a correct implementation of the Haversine formula, which is used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * sinθ;
```
This code fragment is a variation of the Haversine formula, which uses the sine of the bearing instead of the cosine. This can result in a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * (cosθ + sinθ);
```
This code fragment is a variation of the Haversine formula, which adds the sine and cosine of the bearing to the calculation. This can result in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
