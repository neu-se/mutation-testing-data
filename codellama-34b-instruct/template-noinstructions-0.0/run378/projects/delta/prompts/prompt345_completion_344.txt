  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(opData, baseOpData, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not being called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
