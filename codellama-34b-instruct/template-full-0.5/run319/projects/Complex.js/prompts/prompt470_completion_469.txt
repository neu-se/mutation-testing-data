  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `!=` operator checks for non-strict inequality. In this case, `b` is a number, and `1` is a number, so the two expressions would evaluate to the same result. However, if `b` were a different type, such as a string or an object, the two expressions would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs addition, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `b + 1` expression would always evaluate to `NaN`, regardless of the value of `b`, because `b` is a number and `1` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator performs subtra
