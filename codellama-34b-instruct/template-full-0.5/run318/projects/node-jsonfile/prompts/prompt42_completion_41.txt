  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `stringify` function from the `utils` module, which is used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `stringify` function from the `utils` module, and it would also pass a different second argument to `JSON.stringify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options.reviver, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `stringify` function from the `utils` module, and it would also pass a different third argument to `JSON.stringify`.

DONE.
