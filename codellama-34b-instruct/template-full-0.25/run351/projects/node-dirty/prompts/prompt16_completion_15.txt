  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key-value pair from the queue, whereas the original code fragment uses `set` to add or update the key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method would remove all key-value pairs from the queue, whereas the original code fragment only removes the key-value pair for the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would create a shallow copy of the callbacks array, whereas the original code fragment uses the original array.

DONE.
