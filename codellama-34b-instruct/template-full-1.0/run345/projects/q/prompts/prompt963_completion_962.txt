  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
func ReturningNodeError(value) {
    return <error value>, error.New(<error message>)
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a value, but the replacement code fragment returns an error value along with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `unshift` method to insert an element into the beginning of an array, but the replacement code fragment uses the `array_slice` function to create a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.prop = <value>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `unshift` method to insert an element into the beginning of an array, but the replacement code fragment assigns a value to a property of an object.

DONE.
