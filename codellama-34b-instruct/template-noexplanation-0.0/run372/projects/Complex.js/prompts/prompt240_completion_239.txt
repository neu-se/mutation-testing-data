  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a minus sign instead of a plus sign. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect results if the input is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different variable (`b` instead of `a`) in the exponent. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect results if the input is not positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a + b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with an additional term added to the exponent. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` function to return incorrect results if the input is not positive.

DONE.
