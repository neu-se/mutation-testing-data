  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is truthy, the `if` statement would not be executed, and if `abort` is falsy, the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits if the first operand is falsy, so if `abort` is falsy, the `if` statement would not be executed, and if `abort` is truthy, the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits if the first operand is truthy, so if `abort` is truthy, the `if` statement would be executed,
