  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to skip over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation in the this iterator, potentially causing the algorithm to include an unnecessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the lengths of the next operations in both iterators, potentially causing the algorithm to include too many or too few operations.

DONE.
