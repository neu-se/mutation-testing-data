  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property of the `options` object is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.flag
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` property of the `options` object is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
