  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `end` variable to `abort`, regardless of whether `end` was defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `end` variable to `null`, regardless of whether `end` was defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `end` variable to `abort` if it was defined and not `null`, regardless of whether `end` was defined or not.

DONE.
