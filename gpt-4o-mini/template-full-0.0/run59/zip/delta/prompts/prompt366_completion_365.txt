Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the next operation instead of its type, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations, especially when distinguishing between 'insert' and 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the type of the operation from the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter`, potentially causing the logic to incorrectly process operations from the wrong iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the type check to always evaluate as 'delete', which would cause the logic to skip retaining operations and incorrectly process all operations as deletions.

DONE.
