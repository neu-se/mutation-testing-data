  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the value of `op`, which could change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the value of `op`, which could change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always double the value of `op`, which could change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
