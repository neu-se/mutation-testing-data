  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, and the corrected version of the word "chilli" is spelled "chillies."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chilly'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, and the corrected version of the word "chilli" is spelled "chilly."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a typo, and the corrected version of the word "chilli" is spelled "chill."

DONE.
