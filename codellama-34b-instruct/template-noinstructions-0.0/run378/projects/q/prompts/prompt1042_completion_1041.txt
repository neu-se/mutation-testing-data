  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the "head" property, rather than the value of the "tail" property as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "head" property of the "tail" property, rather than the value of the "tail" property as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "tail" property of the "tail" property, rather than the value of the "tail" property as intended.

DONE.
