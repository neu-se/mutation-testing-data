  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).find("li").text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `text()` method to get the text content of the `<a>` element, while this modified code is using `find()` method to get the text content of the `<li>` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).text().toLowerCase().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `trim()` method to remove whitespace from the ends of the text, while this modified code is using `toLowerCase()` method to convert the text to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt($(el).attr("data-id"), 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using `attr()` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, while this modified code is using `attr()` method to get the value of the `data-id` attribute,
