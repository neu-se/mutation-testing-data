  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the state of the promise's inspect method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the state of the promise's inspect method, and it would also check for the opposite condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the state of the promise instead of the state of the promise's inspect method, and it would check for a different condition.

DONE.
