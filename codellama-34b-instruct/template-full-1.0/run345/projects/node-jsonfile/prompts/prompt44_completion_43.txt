  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would change the type of the result from an object to a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `options` object to `stringify`, instead of the entire object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different property of the `options` object to `stringify`, potentially resulting in a different JSON representation.

DONE.
