  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` expects the file name and contents as separate arguments, whereas `fs.writeFile` expects a file name and a single string containing the entire file content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fs` is a reference to the `graceful-fs` module, which is a drop-in replacement for the built-in `fs` module. `graceful-fs` provides additional features such as graceful error handling, but it does not change the behavior of the `writeFileSync` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
readFileSync(file, obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is a synchronous version of the `readFile` method, and it expects a file name, an object, and an options object as arguments, whereas
