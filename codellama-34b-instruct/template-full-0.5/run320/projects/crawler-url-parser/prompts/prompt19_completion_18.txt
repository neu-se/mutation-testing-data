  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/` matches a string that does not start with a protocol (e.g., "http://"), whereas the original code fragment matches a string that starts with "//".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/#.*$/` matches a string that ends with a "#" character, whereas the original code fragment matches a string that starts with "//".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\/\//` matches a string that starts with "//", whereas the original code fragment matches a string that starts with "
