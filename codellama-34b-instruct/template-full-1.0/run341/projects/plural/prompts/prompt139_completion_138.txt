  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional 's' would result in a different plural form than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would remove the last character of the word, resulting in a different plural form than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(1, word.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring would remove the first character of the word, resulting in a different plural form than the original code.

DONE.
