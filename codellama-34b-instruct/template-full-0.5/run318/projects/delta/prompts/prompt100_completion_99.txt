  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!lastOp.attributes` check would always evaluate to `true` if `lastOp` is not an object, causing the `delete` operation to be performed even if `lastOp` is not a `retain` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lastOp.attributes == null` check would always evaluate to `false` if `lastOp` is not an object, causing the `delete` operation to be performed even if `lastOp` is not a `retain` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the
