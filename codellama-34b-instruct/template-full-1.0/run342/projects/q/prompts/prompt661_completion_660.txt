  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is the name of another method in the Q library, and replacing "post" with "get" would likely result in a different error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is the name of another method in the Q library, and replacing "post" with "send" would likely result in a different error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"squirrel"
```
This would result in different behavior because there is no method named "squirrel" in the Q library, and JavaScript would throw an error if a nonexistent method was called on a promise.

DONE.
