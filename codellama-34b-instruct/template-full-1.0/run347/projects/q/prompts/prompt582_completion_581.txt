  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would be continuously called with the same value for `verb`, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5 ? "next" : "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would randomly choose between calling `generator.next()` or `generator.throw()` with a random value, causing non-deterministic behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next" + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would concatenate the string "next" with a random number, causing a type error when trying to call `generator.next()` with a non-numeric argument.

DONE.
