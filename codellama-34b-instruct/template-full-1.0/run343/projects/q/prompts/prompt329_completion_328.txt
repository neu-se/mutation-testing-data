  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object instead of returning a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op + "####"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a prefix to the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op).stackTrace)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the stack trace of the error instead of the error object itself.

DONE.
