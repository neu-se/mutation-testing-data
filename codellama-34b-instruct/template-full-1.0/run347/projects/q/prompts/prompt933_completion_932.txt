  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2).concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment doesn't slice the `args` array, resulting in different argument behavior in the `nfbind` and `denodeify` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment always resolves with the `args` array, regardless of the arguments passed to `nfbind` and `denodeify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code fragment always rejects with the `args` array, regardless of the arguments passed to `nfbind` and `denodeify`.

DONE.
