  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always reject the promise, while `thenResolve` will always resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function (result) { return result + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is modified to add 1 to the result, which would change the final value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function (result) { return result * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is modified to multiply the result by 2, which would change the final value of the promise.

DONE.
