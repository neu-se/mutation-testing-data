  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is zero or infinite, while this modified code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero and infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is zero or infinite, while this modified code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is zero or not a number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is zero or infinite, while this modified code fragment checks if `z` is zero and `this` is infinite.
