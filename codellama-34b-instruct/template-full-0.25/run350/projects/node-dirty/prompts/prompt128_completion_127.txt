  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called on every iteration of the loop, which would cause the stream to be uncorked multiple times, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called on every iteration of the loop, which would cause the stream to be corked multiple times, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is being written to the stream on every iteration of the loop, which would cause the stream to be written to multiple times, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
