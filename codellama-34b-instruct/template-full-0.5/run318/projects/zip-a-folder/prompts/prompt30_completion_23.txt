  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` would be emitted instead of `'close'`, which would cause the promise to resolve even if there was an error in the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'finish'` would be emitted instead of `'close'`, which would cause the promise to reject even if the output stream was closed successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected even if the output stream was closed successfully.

DONE.
