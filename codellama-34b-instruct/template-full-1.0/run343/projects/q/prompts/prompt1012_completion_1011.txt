  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the `error` object, regardless of whether the underlying operation succeeded or failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the `value` object, regardless of whether the underlying operation succeeded or failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always notify the promise with the `progress` object, regardless of whether the underlying operation succeeded or failed.

DONE.
