  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer be able to access the arguments passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be able to access the undeclared variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only access the first argument, whereas the original code fragment allowed it to access all arguments.

DONE.
