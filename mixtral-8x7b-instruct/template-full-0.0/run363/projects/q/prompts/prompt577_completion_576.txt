 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"next".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function expects the string `"next"` in lowercase, and changing it to uppercase would cause the function to not behave as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Symbol("next")
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer` function is expecting a string, and changing it to a Symbol would cause the function to not behave as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer` function is expecting a string, and changing it to a number would cause the function to not behave as intended.

DONE.
