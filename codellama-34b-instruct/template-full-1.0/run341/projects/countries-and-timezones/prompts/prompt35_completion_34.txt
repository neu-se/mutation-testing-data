  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Math.abs(input) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the absolute value of the input number, while the modified code fragment would return the absolute value of the input number plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 input * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the absolute value of the input number, while the modified code fragment would return the negative of the input number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 input.toFixed(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the absolute value of the input number, while the modified code fragment would return the absolute value of the input number rounded to two decimal places.

DONE.
