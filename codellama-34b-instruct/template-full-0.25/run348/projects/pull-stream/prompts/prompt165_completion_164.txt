  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` as arguments, but the new code fragment only passes `cb` and `abort` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is being called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` as arguments, but the new code fragment passes `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort` as arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort
