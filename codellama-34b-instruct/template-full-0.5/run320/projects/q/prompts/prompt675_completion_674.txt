  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method of the Function object that is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method of the Function object that is used to create a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a different method of the Function object that is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

DONE.
