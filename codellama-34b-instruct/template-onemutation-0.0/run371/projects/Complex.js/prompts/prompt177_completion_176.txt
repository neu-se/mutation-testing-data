  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.abs()` function to get the absolute value of `d`, while the new code fragment multiplies `c` and `d` without taking their absolute values. This could cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase, leading to different results in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
