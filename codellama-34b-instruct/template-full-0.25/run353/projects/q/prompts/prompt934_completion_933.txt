  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which is a way to represent `undefined` in JavaScript. In this case, `null` would be passed as the first argument to `Q.denodeify.apply`, which could cause the function to behave differently.
