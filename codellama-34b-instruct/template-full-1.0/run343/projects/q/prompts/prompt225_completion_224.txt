  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` creates a new array and copies a section of the original array to it, whereas `Array.prototype.slice` returns a new array that contains the section of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` returns a new array that contains the section of the original array, whereas `array_slice()` creates a new array and copies a section of the original array to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...arguments].slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[...arguments]` creates a new array by concatenating all the elements of the `arguments` object, whereas `array_slice()` creates a new array and copies a section of the original array to it.

DONE.
