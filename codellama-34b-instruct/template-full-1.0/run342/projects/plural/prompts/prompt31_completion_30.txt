  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different ending index, so the resulting string would be shorter by one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would include an extra "s" character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would not include the "es" ending.

DONE.
