  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of the `progressed` variable, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of the `progressed` variable, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` would halve the value of the `progressed` variable, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
