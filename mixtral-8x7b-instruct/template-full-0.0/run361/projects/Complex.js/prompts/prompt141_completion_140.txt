 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks for a specific value of 're' being equal to Infinity, instead of checking if the complex number is infinite using the 'isInfinite' method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.isInteger(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 're' is an integer, rather than checking if the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.hasOwnProperty('isInfinite')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'isInfinite' is an own property of the current object, instead of checking if the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
