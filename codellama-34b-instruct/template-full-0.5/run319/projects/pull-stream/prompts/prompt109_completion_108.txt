  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reducer` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, potentially leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reducer` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, potentially leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `+ 1` would cause the returned value to be different from the original code, which could impact the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reducer` function to be called with a different value for the `data` argument, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
