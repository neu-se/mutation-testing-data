 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated tile x and y values would be different, causing the resulting tile to be in a different location than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated tile x and y values would be multiplied by 2, causing the resulting tile to be in a different location than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom) / 2
