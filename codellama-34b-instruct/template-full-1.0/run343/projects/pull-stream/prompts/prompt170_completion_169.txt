  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the element at the `i`th index of the `array` to the callback, while this modified code fragment passes `null` to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment incremented the `i`th variable after passing the element to the callback, while this modified code fragment increments the `i`th variable before passing the element to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the element at the `i`th index of the `array` to the callback, while this modified code fragment passes the element at the `i-1`th index of the `array` to the callback.

DONE.
