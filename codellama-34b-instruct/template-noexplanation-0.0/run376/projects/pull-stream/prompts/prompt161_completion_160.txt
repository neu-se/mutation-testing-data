  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it uses a different variable name for the callback function. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, and the test suite should still pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value + 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it adds 1 to the value of `_value` before passing it to the callback function. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, and the test suite should still pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value * 2)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it multiplies the value of `_value` by 2 before passing it to the callback function. This change should not affect the behavior of the code, and the test suite should still pass.

DONE.
