Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly passes `null` as the first argument to the callback, indicating no error occurred, which may lead to incorrect handling of errors in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `end` as the first argument and `null` as the second, which could mislead the caller into thinking that an error occurred when it actually did not, depending on the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `data` as the only argument to the callback, which is not the expected signature of the callback function (it should take an error as the first argument), potentially causing runtime errors in the consuming code.

DONE.
