 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"apPLY"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison for the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the function to not execute as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"applyFn"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would not recognize the string, causing the function to not execute as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `apply` method on the current object, which may not have the desired effect and could potentially cause an error.

DONE.
