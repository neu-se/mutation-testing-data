  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the third capture group from the third part of the regular expression, which may not even exist, and could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the entire match, which may not correspond to the line number in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine[<integer>]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract a specific character from the stack trace line, which may not correspond to the line number in the stack trace.

DONE.
