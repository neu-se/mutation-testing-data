  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.indexOf('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `insert` property is not an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.indexOf('', 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start searching for the empty string at the second character of the `insert` property, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the `insert` property starts with a non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.indexOf('', -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start searching for the empty string from the end of the `insert` property, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` if the `insert` property ends with a non-empty string.
