  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that expects an error object as an argument, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `e` is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.onerror` function to be called with a new error object, which would trigger the error handling logic.

DONE.
