Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("All promises were rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise if any of the promises are rejected, rather than waiting for all promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(promises, function (promises) { return promises; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with the original array of promises without waiting for them to settle, which is not the intended functionality of `allResolved`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.all(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the input as a standard `all` operation, which rejects immediately upon the first rejection, rather than waiting for all promises to settle.

DONE.
