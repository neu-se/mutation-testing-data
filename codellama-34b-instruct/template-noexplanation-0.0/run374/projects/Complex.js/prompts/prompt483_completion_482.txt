  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']();
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return `true` regardless of the value of `this['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']() && this['im'] === 0;
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return `true` if `this['im']` is `0`, regardless of the value of `this['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']() && this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0;
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it will always return `true` if `this['im']` and `this['re']` are both `0`, regardless of the value of `this['im']`.

DONE.
