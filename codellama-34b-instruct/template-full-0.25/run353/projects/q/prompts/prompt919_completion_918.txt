  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node resolver, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would call the function and return the result, which is not a node resolver.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)` is a bound function that returns a node resolver, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node resolver.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)` is a function that returns a node resolver, but `deferred.makeNodeResolver` is a function that returns a node resolver.
