  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { constructor: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `constructor` property of the `result` object with `null`, which would prevent the `buildTimezonesMap` function from properly initializing the `result` object and would likely cause errors when the `result` object is accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] }

This would likely cause errors when the `result` object is accessed, as the property would not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new property on the `result` object with the same name as the
