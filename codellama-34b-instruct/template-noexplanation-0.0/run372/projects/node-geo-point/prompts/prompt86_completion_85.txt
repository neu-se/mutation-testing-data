  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it is missing the `sinθ` term.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ + 1
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it adds an extra `1` to the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ + 0.5
```
This code fragment is a buggy version of the original code, as it adds an extra `0.5` to the calculation.

DONE.
