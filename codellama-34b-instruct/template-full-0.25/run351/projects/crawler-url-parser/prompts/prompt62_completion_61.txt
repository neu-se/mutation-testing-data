  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + '//' + parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that includes the protocol and host of the URL, whereas the original code fragment returns the parsed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that includes the host and path of the URL, whereas the original code fragment returns the parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host + parsedUrl.path + parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string that includes the host, path, and search query of the URL, whereas the original code fragment returns the parsed URL object.

DONE.
