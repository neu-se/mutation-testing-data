  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would always evaluate to a different value than simply `b`, even if the original `b` value hasn't changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * 2` expression would always evaluate to twice the value of `b`, even if `b` hasn't changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b / 2` expression would always evaluate to half the value of `b`, even if `b` hasn't changed.

DONE.
