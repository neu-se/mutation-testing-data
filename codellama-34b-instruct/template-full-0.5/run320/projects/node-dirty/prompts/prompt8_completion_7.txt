  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being stored in the database would be incremented by 1, which could cause unexpected results if the code that retrieves the value from the database is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being stored in the database would be decremented by 1, which could cause unexpected results if the code that retrieves the value from the database is not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being stored in the database would be doubled, which could cause unexpected results if the code that retrieves the value from the database is not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
