  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute as `i` would always be `0` at the start of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute for every other iteration, as `i` would be incremented by `2` each time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once for the last element in the `rules` array, instead of iterating through the entire array.

DONE.
