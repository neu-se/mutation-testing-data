  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver object, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `makeNodeResolver()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that also does not have a `makeNodeResolver()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{"makeNodeResolver": function(){}}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a node resolver object, but `{"makeNodeResolver": function(){}}` is a plain object that has a `makeNodeResolver()` method but does not have the same behavior as the original function.

DONE.
