  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator (`&&`) to make sure that both `'abs'` and `'arg'` are in `a`, while the replaced code fragment uses a logical OR operator (`||`) to check if either `'abs'` or `'arg'` is in `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `'abs'` is in `a` and `'arg'` is in `a`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `'abs'` is in `a` and `'arg'` is in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in a && 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a logical AND operator (`&&`) to make sure that both
