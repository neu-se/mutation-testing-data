  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "if (task === Promise.resolve) { return; }". This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the function from being called if task is a resolved promise, which could cause the script to skip certain steps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "if (typeof task !== 'function') { return; }". This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the function from being called if task is not a function, which could cause the script to fail with a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "if (task.constructor.name === 'Promise') { return; }". This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the function from being called if task is a promise, which could cause the script to skip certain steps.

DONE.
