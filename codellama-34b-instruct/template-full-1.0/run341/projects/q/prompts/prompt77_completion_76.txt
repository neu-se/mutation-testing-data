  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` waits the passed number of milliseconds and runs the function repeatedly whereas `setTimeout` waits the passed number of milliseconds and runs the function once. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes 1 as the second argument to `setTimeout` instead of 0, which would make the callback function run after 1 millisecond instead of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` waits for the next animation frame and runs the function whereas `setTimeout` waits for the passed number of milliseconds and runs the function.

DONE.
