  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"state": "fulfilled", "value": null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a reference to the `value` variable, which may not be defined in the context where the placeholder is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"state": "fulfilled", "value": undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a reference to the `value` variable, which may not be defined in the context where the placeholder is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"state": "fulfilled", "value": "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a reference to the `value` variable, which may not be defined in the context where the placeholder is used.

DONE.
