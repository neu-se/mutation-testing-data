 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('drain'), this
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of directly emitting the 'drain' event, it wraps the emission in a function, which might not trigger the event handlers correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'flush' is not the same as 'drain', and the event handlers listening for 'drain' will not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument for the 'drain' event should be a function, but here it is an integer, which will cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
