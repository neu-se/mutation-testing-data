 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
console.log(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the line to the console instead of passing it to the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
predicate(line, {}, i + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the `i` variable before passing it to the predicate function, causing the line numbers to be off by one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
predicate(line, {}, Math.random());
