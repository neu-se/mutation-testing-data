 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method checks if the `object` is an instance of `Promise` and throws an error if it is not. Replacing it with `null` would bypass this check and cause the `dispatch` method to throw a different error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an object, and an array is not an object. This would cause the `dispatch` method to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects the `object` to have a `promiseDispatch` method, which is not present in the `Promise.resolve()` object. This would cause the `dispatch` method to throw a TypeError.

DONE.
