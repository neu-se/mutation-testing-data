  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset, length` uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand. In contrast, `offset + length` uses the addition operator, which returns the sum of the two operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset, length` uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand. In contrast, `offset - length` uses the subtraction operator, which returns the difference between the two operands.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `offset, length` uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second operand. In contrast, `length - offset` uses the subtraction operator, which returns the difference between the two oper
