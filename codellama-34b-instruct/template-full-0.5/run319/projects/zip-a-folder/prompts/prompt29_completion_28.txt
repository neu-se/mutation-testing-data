  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise when the output stream is closed, while the replaced code fragment rejects the promise instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Testing mutation'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with no arguments, while the replaced code fragment resolves the promise with an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(output.on('error', reject))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with no arguments, while the replaced code fragment resolves the promise with the result of the `on` method, which is a function that handles the error event.

DONE.
