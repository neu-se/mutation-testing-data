  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'] || this['im'] !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this['isZero']` is true, while this modified code also checks if `this['im']` is not equal to 0. This would cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed if `this['im']` is not equal to 0, even if `this['isZero']` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!this['isZero'] && this['im'] === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this['isZero']` is true, while this modified code also checks if `this['im']` is equal to 0. This would cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed if `this['isZero']` is false and `this['im']` is equal to 0, even if `this['
