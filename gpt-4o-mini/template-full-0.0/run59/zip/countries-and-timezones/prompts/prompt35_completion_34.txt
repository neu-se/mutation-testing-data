Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input value by adding 1, which would affect the calculation of the absolute value and potentially lead to incorrect formatting of the offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the input value, which would change the sign of the offset and result in an incorrect representation of the time zone offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the input value by 60, which would incorrectly scale the offset value and lead to an inaccurate representation of the time zone offset string.

DONE.
