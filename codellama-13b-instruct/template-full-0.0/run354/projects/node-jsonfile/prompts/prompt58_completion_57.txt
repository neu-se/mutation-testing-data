  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would now append two newlines to the end of the string, instead of just one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would now append a space and a newline to the end of the string, instead of just a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + EOL + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would now append three newlines to the end of the string, instead of just one.

DONE.
