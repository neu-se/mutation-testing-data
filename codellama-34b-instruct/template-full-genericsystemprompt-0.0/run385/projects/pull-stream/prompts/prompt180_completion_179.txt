  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being incremented, which could cause the function to behave differently when the `abort` flag is set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being decremented, which could cause the function to behave differently when the `abort` flag is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now being negated, which could cause the function to behave differently when the `abort` flag is set.

DONE.
