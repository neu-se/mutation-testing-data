  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero, while this replacement checks if either `a` or `b` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are not equal to zero, while this replacement checks if neither `a` nor `b` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to zero and `b` is not equal to zero.

DONE.
