  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this code fragment checks if `ops` has a `length` property. This could result in different behavior if `ops` is not an array, but has a `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this code fragment checks if `ops` has a `length` property that is greater than 0. This could result in different behavior if `ops` is not an array, but has a `length` property that is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ops` is an array, while this code fragment checks if `ops` has a `length` property that is
