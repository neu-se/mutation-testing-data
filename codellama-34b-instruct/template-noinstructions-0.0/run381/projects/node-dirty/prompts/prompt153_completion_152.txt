  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called on the write stream, which would allow data to be written to the stream even if it is not ready to be written. This could cause data to be lost or corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called on the write stream, which would prevent data from being written to the stream until it is ready. This could cause the write stream to block indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to close and no more data can be written to it. This could cause the write stream to close unexpectedly.

DONE.
