  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would be passed as the first argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would be passed as the first argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the NaN value would be passed as the first argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which would likely cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
