  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" verb to continue the generator, while this replacement uses the "throw" verb to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" verb to continue the generator, while this replacement uses the "return" verb to return a value from the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "next" verb to continue the generator, while this replacement uses the "yield" verb to yield a value from the generator.

DONE.
