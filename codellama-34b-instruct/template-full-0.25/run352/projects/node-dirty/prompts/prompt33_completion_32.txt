  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted, while `null` would set the value of the key to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted, while `false` would set the value of the key to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `undefined` is used to indicate that the key should be deleted, while `0` would set the value of the key to `0`.

DONE.
