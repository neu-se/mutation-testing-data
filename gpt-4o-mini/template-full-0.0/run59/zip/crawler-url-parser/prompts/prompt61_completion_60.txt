Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns a URL object instead of a formatted string, which would lead to the `ret.url` being an object rather than a string representation of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href;
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedUrl.href` returns the full URL as a string, but it may not include the same formatting as `URL.format`, potentially omitting certain components or altering the structure of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format({ ...parsedUrl, protocol: 'ftp:' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the protocol to be 'ftp:', which is not a valid protocol for web URLs in this context, potentially leading to incorrect URL handling or validation failures.

DONE.
