  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `map` function as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `map` function as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `cb` function as the second argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
