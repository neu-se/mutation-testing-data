  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a method that closes the stream, while `cork` is a method that pauses the output of the stream. Using `end` would cause the stream to be closed after writing the data, while `cork` would pause the output, but the stream would remain open.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.pipe(this._readStream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pipe` is a method that connects the output of one stream to the input of another stream. In this case, it would connect the output of `this._writeStream` to the input of `this._readStream`, which would cause the data written to `this._writeStream` to be read from `this._readStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork
