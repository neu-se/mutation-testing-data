  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end + 1` would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `end - 1` would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `end * 2` would cause the loop to iterate twice as many times, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
