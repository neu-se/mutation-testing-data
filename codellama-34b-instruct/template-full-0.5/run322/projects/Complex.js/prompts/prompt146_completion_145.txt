  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isInfinite']()` is not a function and would cause a syntax error, whereas `this['isInfinite']()` is a function that checks if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['isZero']()` is not a function and would cause a syntax error, whereas `this['isZero']()` is a function that checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re']` is a property that refers to the real part of the complex number, whereas `this['re']` is a property that refers to the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
