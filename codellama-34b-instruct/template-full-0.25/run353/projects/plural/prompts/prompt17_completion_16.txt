  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function passed as the second argument is also different. The original code fragment uses a regular expression pattern that matches words that end with "x", "ch", or "s", while the new code fragment uses a regular expression pattern that matches words that end with "x", "ch", or "s", but also includes a capturing group for the "s" at the end of the word. The function passed as the second argument in the new code fragment also includes a reference to the capturing group, which would not be present in the original code fragment.
