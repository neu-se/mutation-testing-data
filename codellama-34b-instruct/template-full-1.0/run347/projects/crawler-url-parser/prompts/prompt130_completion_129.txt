  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object is empty, whereas `pageurl` is expected to have properties and methods for the URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
""`
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid URL and would throw an error when trying to parse it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid URL and would throw an error when trying to parse it.

DONE.
