  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only captures the file name and line number, while this new code fragment captures the file name, line number, and column number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):\d+:\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only captures the file name and line number, while this new code fragment captures the file name, line number, column number, and another number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
