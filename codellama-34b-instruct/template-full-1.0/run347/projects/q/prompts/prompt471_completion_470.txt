  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], reportedUnhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the event is emitted with the reason and the reported unhandled rejection, instead of the unhandled reason and the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", null, unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the event is emitted with null as the reason, instead of the unhandled reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledRejections[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because the event is emitted with the unhandled reason and the unhandled rejection, instead of the reason and the reported unhandled rejection.

DONE.
