  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this._queue.size` checks if the size of the queue is not zero, while `this._queue.size === 0` checks if the size of the queue is exactly zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this._queue.size` checks if the size of the queue is not zero, while `this._queue.size < 0` checks if the size of the queue is less than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this._queue.size` checks if the size of the queue is not zero, while `this._queue.size > 0` checks if the size of the queue is greater than zero.

DONE.
