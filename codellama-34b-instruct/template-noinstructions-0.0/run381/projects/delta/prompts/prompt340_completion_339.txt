  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only increments the base index by 1, while this replacement increments it by 2. This could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations in the delta, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only increments the base index by 1, while this replacement increments it by 3. This could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations in the delta, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only increments the base index by 1, while this replacement increments it by 4. This could cause the iterator to skip over certain operations in the delta, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
