  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return `null` instead of the object, which would cause the `master` function to return a promise that is not wrapping the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return `undefined` instead of the object, which would cause the `master` function to return a promise that is not wrapping the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return an empty object instead of the object, which would cause the `master` function to return a promise that is not wrapping the object.

DONE.
