  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 degrees would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 360 degrees to the angle `θ` would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting 360 degrees from the angle `θ` would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

DONE.
