  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object that stores the key-value pairs in the database, while `this._data` is a Map object that stores the in-memory cache of the database. Using `this._queue` instead of `this._data` would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the database, rather than the in-memory cache.
