  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects a promise or an immediate value as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects a promise or an immediate value as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects a promise or an immediate value as its first argument, and passing `0` would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
