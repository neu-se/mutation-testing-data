  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would cause the `closed.promise` to be rejected, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.promise.reject` would cause the `closed.promise` to be rejected, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` would cause the `ends.promise` to be rejected, whereas `closed.resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

DONE.
