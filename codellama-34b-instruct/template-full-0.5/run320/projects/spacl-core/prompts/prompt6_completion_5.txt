  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra backslash would cause the regex to match a literal backslash at the beginning of the string, instead of the forward slash that was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match a wider range of characters at the beginning of the string, including letters, digits, and special characters, instead of just a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:|[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match either an empty string or a string that contains only the specified characters, instead of just a forward slash.

DONE.
