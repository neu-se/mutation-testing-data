  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` might be `null`, which would make the condition `true` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` might be `undefined`, which would make the condition `false` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` might be `null`, which would make the condition `false` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`.

DONE.
