  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the code would be using the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the value of `b` by 2, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
