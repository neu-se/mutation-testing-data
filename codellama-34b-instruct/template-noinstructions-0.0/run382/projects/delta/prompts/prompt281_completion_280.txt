  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire document, rather than just the current line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire document, minus the last character, rather than just the current line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire document, plus an extra character, rather than just the current line.

DONE.
