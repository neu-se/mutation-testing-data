  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` would return the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next()` would return the next operation and advance the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` would return the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation and advance the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would indicate that there are no more operations to iterate over, whereas `thisIter.next()` or `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation to be processed.

DONE.
