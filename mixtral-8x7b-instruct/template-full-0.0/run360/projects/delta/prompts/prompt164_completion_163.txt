 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize insert operations from the other Delta over delete operations in this Delta, which is different from the original behavior of prioritizing delete operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize retain operations over delete operations, which is different from the original behavior of prioritizing delete operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize operations based on their length, rather than their type, which is different from the original behavior of prioritizing delete operations.

DONE.
