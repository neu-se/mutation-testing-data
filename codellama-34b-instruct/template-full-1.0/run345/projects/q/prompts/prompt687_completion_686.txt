  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments.length-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code references the second argument, but the replaced code references the last argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code references the second argument, but the replaced code references the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code references the second argument, but the replaced code references the second and third arguments (if they exist).

DONE.
