  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` permission check is missing, which could allow the program to write to the target directory without proper authorization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` permission check is missing, which could allow the program to read from the target directory without proper authorization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(targetBasePath), fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname(targetBasePath)` expression would return the parent directory of the target directory, which could cause the program to check permissions for the wrong directory.

DONE.
