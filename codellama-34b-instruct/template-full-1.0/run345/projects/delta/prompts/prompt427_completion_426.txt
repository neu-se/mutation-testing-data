  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `op.retain` property is a string containing the value `'number'`, rather than checking if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `op.retain` property is not a number, rather than checking if it is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `op.retain` property is an instance of the `Number` type, rather than checking if it is a number.

DONE.
