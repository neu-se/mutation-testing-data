  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arg` function to return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arg` function to return a value that is one unit greater than the imaginary part of the complex number, which would affect the calculation of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `arg` function to return a value that is twice the imaginary part of the complex number, which would affect the calculation of the angle.

DONE.
