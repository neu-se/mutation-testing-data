  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that would be called immediately, causing the promise to be rejected, whereas `noop` is a function that does nothing and returns `undefined`, which would not cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that would be called immediately, causing the promise to be notified, whereas `noop` is a function that does nothing and returns `undefined`, which would not cause the promise to be notified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that would be called immediately, causing the promise to be resolved, whereas `noop` is a function that does nothing and returns `undefined`, which would not cause the promise to be resolved.
