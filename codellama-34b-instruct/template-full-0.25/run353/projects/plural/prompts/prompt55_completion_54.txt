  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `regex` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Using a different variable or object property would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `regex` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Using a different variable or object property would cause the code to fail.
