  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods of the `Delta` class, and they have different effects on the delta's contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` have different effects on the delta's contents, and `retain(0)` would cause the delta to retain the next operation, which would not happen with `push`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` have different effects on the delta's contents, and `delete(0)` would cause the delta to delete the next operation, which would not happen with `push`.

DONE.
