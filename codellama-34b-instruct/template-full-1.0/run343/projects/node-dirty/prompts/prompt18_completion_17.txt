  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs` is a list of callback functions, and `cbs.length` would return the number of callback functions, which is not the same as `cbs` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs` is a list of callback functions, and `cbs.push(cb)` would add the `cb` callback function to the end of the list, which is not the same as replacing the entire list of callback functions in `cbs` with the new callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a list of callback functions, and assigning `null` to `cbs` would cause an error if `cbs` is used as a list of callback functions.

DONE.
