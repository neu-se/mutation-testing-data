  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `aborted` error as an argument, whereas in the modified code, the `abortCb` function is called instead, which may have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `aborted` error as an argument, whereas in the modified code, the `null` value is used instead, which may have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `aborted` error as an argument, whereas in the modified code, the `undefined` value is used instead, which may have different behavior.

DONE.
