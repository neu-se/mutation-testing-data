  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it's falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it's strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it's not strictly equal to `null`.

DONE.
