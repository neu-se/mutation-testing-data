  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the same strings as the original code fragment, but the replacement string would be empty, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the same strings as the original code fragment, but the replacement string would be different, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
