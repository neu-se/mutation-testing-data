  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always negate the `abort` variable, regardless of whether it has been set to `true` or `false`. The original code fragment checked the value of `abort` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`. The original code fragment checked the value of `abort` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof abort === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the variable `abort` has been declared, regardless of its value. The original code fragment checked the value of `abort` directly.
DONE.
