  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `err instanceof Function` checks if `err` is an instance of the `Function` class, while `'function' == typeof err` checks if `err` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof err === 'function'` checks if `err` is a function, while `'function' == typeof err` checks if `err` is a function and also checks if it is a string that is equal to the string `'function'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.constructor === Function` checks if `err` is an instance of the `Function` class, while `'function' == typeof err` checks if `err` is a function.

DONE.
