 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the Q.defer() method instead of the defer() method local to the module. This could lead to unexpected behavior due to the use of a different deferred object than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new resolved promise using the Promise.resolve() method instead of using the deferred object. This could lead to unexpected behavior due to the use of a different promise than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `defer` method on the `Promise.prototype` object instead of the local `defer` function. This would result in a `TypeError` because `defer` is not a method of the `Promise.prototype` object.

DONE.
