  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise or a thenable, while `value !== null` only checks if the value is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise or a thenable, while `value !== undefined` only checks if the value is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise or a thenable, while `typeof value === "object"` only checks if the value is an object.

DONE.
