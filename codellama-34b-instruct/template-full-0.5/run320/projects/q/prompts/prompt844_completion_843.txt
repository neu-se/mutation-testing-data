  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if the promise was rejected. Replacing it with `null` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null` instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error with a specific message. Replacing it with `new Error("Different error message")` would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `error`, which would throw an error if the promise was rejected. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
