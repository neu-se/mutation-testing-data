  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if the array is empty, but the new code fragment returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if the array is empty, but the new code fragment returns `false` if the array is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if the array is empty, but the new code fragment returns `false` if the array contains `undefined` values.

DONE.
