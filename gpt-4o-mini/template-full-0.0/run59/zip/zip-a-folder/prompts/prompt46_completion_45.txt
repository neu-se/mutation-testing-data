Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, ''); 
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `false` to an empty string, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the archiving process, potentially causing the archive to be created incorrectly or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `false` to `null`, which could cause the archiver to treat the directory path incorrectly, leading to an error or an empty archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `false` to `true`, which may cause the archiver to include the directory itself in the archive rather than just its contents, altering the structure of the resulting archive.

DONE.
