  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the file with the exact name provided, while this modified code fragment reads a file with the same name but with a '.json' extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('.json', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the file with the exact name provided, while this modified code fragment reads a file with the same name but without the '.json' extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment reads the file with the exact name provided, while this modified code fragment reads a file with the same name but in uppercase.

DONE.
