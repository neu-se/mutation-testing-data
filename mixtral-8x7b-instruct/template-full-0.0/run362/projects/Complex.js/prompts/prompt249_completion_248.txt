 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `Math.expm1(a * 0)` is always 0, which would cause the real part of the result to be 0 regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a + 1)` is not equivalent to `Math.exp(a) - 1` for all values of `a`, which could cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(Math.exp(a))` is not equivalent to `Math.exp(a) - 1` for all values of `a`, which could cause the result to be incorrect.

DONE.
