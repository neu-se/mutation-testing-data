  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function as its first argument, but `fs.readFile` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function as its first argument, and `fs.readFileSync` is a function, but it is not a callback-style function that takes an error as its first argument.

DONE.
