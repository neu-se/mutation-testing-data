  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `cb`, is inside an `if` block that checks the `aborted` flag, while this new code fragment is not inside any block. So this new fragment will always be executed, even if `aborted` is not true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `cb`, is inside an `if` block that checks the `aborted` flag, while this new code fragment is not inside any block. So this new fragment will always be executed, even if `aborted` is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(data, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `cb`, is inside an `if` block that checks the `aborted` flag, while this new
