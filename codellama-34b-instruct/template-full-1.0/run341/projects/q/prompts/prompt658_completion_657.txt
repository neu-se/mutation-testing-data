  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, <1>)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would change the value of the `args` variable passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 2 instead of 0, which would change the value of the `args` variable passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
return Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 10)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at index 1
