  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read || typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true` if `read` is truthy, regardless of the type of `read.source`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof read.source === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only check the type of `read.source`, without considering the value of `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would check if `read` is truthy and if `read.source` is not a function, which would cause the code to execute the `else` block if `read` is truthy but `read.source` is not a function.

DONE.
