  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a / 2` will give a different result from `Math.sqrt` when `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(a)` will give a different result from `Math.sqrt` when `a` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + 1) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `(a + 1) / 2` will give a different result from `Math.sqrt` when `a` is negative.

DONE.
