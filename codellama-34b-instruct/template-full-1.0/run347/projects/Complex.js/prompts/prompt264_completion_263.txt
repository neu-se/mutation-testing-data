  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the argument passed to the `Math.atan2` function, which could potentially change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the magnitude of the argument passed to the `Math.atan2` function, which could potentially change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the angle, which is used to determine the quadrant of the complex number.

DONE.
