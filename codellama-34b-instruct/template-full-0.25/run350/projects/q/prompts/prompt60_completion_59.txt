  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout.bind` is a different function than `setImmediate.bind`, and it would cause the `requestTick` function to use `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate` to schedule the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval.bind` is a different function than `setImmediate.bind`, and it would cause the `requestTick` function to use `setInterval` instead of `setImmediate` to schedule the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame.bind` is a different function than `setImmediate.bind`, and it would cause the `requestTick` function to use `requestAnimationFrame` instead of `setImmediate` to schedule the `
