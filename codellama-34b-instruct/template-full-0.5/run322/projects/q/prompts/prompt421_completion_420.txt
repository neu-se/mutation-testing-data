  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would invert the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the object is a promise-like object, which is not necessarily the same as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if the object is a fulfilled promise, which is not necessarily the same as a rejected promise.

DONE.
