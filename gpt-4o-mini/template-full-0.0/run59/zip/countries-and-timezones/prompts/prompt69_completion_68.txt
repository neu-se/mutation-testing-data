Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks specifically for `undefined` instead of checking if the timezone does not exist, which could lead to false positives if the timezone exists but is set to a falsy value like `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezones[name] && timezones[name] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition that checks if `timezones[name]` is not `null`, which could cause the function to skip memoization for valid timezones that are simply falsy (like `0` or `''`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if the value of `timezones[name]` is strictly `true`, which would prevent memoization for any timezone that is not explicitly set to `true`, even if it exists.

DONE.
