  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation. If the length of the next operation is different from its type, the resulting behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator, and `peekLength()` would return the length of the next operation in that iterator, which may be different from the length of the next operation in `thisIter`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is a different iterator, and `peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in that iterator, which may be different from the type of the next operation in `thisIter`.

DONE
