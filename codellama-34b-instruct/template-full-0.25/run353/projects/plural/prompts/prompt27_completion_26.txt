  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would be one character shorter than the original code, which could cause issues with the pluralization of words that end in "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would be one character longer than the original code, which could cause issues with the pluralization of words that end in "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would be twice as long as the original code, which could cause issues with the pluralization of words that end in "s".

DONE.
