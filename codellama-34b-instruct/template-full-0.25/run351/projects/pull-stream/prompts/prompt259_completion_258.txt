  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without executing any of the remaining code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `read` function and passed to the `cb` function as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a `null` value, which would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with a `null` value, which would cause the `read` function to be called with a `null` value.

DONE.
