  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `glob` option set to `true`, which would cause the archive to include all files and directories matching the glob pattern, rather than just the files and directories in the specified directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `glob` option set to `'*'`, which would cause the archive to include all files and directories in the specified directory, rather than just the files and directories matching the glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'**/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would be called with the `glob` option set to `'**/*'`, which would cause the archive to include all files and directories in the specified directory and its subdirectories, rather than just the files and directories matching the glob pattern.
