  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"This is a different string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `arguments`, which refers to the function's arguments, but the new code fragment is a hardcoded string, which would not have the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `arguments`, which refers to the function's arguments, but the new code fragment is an arithmetic expression that returns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `arguments`, which refers to the function's arguments, but the new code fragment is the `undefined` keyword, which would not have the same behavior.

DONE.
