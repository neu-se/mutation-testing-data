  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `then` method on the `promise` object, while this code fragment does. This means that the `then` method will be called on the `promise` object, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `catch` method on the `promise` object, while this code fragment does. This means that the `catch` method will be called on the `promise` object, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `finally` method on the `promise` object, while this code fragment does.
