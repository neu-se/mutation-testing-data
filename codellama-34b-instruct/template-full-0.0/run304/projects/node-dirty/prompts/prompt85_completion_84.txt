  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while this new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using an empty string as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(' ', 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while this new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using a space character as the separator and limits the number of splits to 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while this new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using a null character as the separator.
