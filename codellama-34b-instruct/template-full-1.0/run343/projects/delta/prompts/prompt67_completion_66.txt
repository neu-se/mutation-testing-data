  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the element at `index` in the `ops` array with `newOp`, rather than pushing `newOp` to the end of the array as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `newOp` at `index` in the `ops` array, rather than pushing it to the end of the array as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend `newOp` to the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than pushing it to the end of the array as the original code does.

DONE.
