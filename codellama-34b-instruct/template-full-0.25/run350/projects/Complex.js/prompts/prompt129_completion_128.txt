  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore return `undefined` when accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is now defined as a function that always returns `true`, regardless of the value of the `z` object.

DONE.
