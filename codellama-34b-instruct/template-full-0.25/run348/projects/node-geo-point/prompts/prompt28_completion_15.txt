  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, but `point2.longitude` is already in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is a function that converts radians to degrees, but `point2.longitude` is already in degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `point2.longitude` is already in degrees, but `Math.PI / 180` is a conversion factor to convert degrees to radians.

DONE.
