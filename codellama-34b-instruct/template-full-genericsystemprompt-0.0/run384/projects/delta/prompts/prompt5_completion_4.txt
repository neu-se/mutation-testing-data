  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `keepNull` is `true`, regardless of the value of `attributes[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `attributes[key]` is `false`, regardless of the value of `keepNull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `attributes[key]` is `null`, regardless of the value of `keepNull`.

DONE.
