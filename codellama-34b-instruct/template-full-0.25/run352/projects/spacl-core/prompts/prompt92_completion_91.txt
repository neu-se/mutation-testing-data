  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator over the values in the `policies` map, rather than the keys. This means that the `push()` method would be adding the values of the `policies` map to the `PolicyMap` instance, rather than the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the `policies` map, rather than the keys. This means that the `push()` method would be adding the key-value pairs of the `policies` map to the `PolicyMap` instance, rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys in the `polic
