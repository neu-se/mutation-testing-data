  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `base[key] !== attr[key]` checks if the two values are not equal, while `attr[key] !== null` checks if the value is not null. By replacing `attr[key] !== undefined` with `attr[key] !== null`, we are checking if the value is not null instead of not undefined, which could lead to different behavior in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] || attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `base[key] !== attr[key]` checks if the two values are not equal, while `||` (OR) operator checks if either of the two conditions is true. By replacing `&&` (AND) operator with `||` operator, we are checking if either of the two conditions is true, which could lead to different behavior
