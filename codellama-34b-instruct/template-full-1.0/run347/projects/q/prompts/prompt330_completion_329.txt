  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because unlike `exception`, `undefined` is not an object and does not have properties such as `message` or `stack`. If `undefined` is thrown, the error message would be less informative, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because unlike `exception`, `null` is a literal value and does not have properties such as `message` or `stack`. If `null` is thrown, the error message would be more informative, but it would not provide any additional context about the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw "An error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing an error object, a string is thrown. This would result in a different error message being displayed, but it would not provide any additional context about the error.

DONE.
