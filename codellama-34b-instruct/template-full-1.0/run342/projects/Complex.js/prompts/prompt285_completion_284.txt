  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(2*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function has a different
behavior than `cosh` for large values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(2*b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` term would introduce
a constant offset in the output, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh(2*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would
change the sign of the output, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
