  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coshx
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is a function that takes a single argument, while `coshx` is a non-existent function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is a function that takes a single argument, while `-cosh` is a unary negation operator applied to the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is a function that takes a single argument, while `a * b` is a multiplication of two variables.

DONE.
