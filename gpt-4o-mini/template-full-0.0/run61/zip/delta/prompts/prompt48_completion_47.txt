Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType && embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the operation to proceed if the embedType is defined and matches the embed type of `b`, which is the opposite of the original logic that checks for a mismatch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType && embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the operation to proceed only if `embedType` is not defined and matches the embed type of `b`, which contradicts the original logic that requires a defined embedType to check for a match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the operation to proceed if the embed types do not match, which is contrary to the original logic that throws an error when the embed types do not match.

DONE.
