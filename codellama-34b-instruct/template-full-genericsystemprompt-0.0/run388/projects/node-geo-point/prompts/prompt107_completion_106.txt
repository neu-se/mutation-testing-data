  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be different, leading to a different result for the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be different, leading to a different result for the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the exponent would be different, leading to a different result for the calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
