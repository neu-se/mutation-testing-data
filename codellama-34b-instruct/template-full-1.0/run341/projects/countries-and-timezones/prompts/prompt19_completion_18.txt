  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.a
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.a` is the alias of a timezone, whereas `id` is the actual timezone id.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is the raw timezone data, whereas `id` is the extracted timezone id.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid timezone id, and would likely cause errors in the code.

DONE.
