Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the remaining operations in the iterator to the entire list of operations, potentially leading to incorrect concatenation of operations that should not be included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the remaining operations from the `otherIter` instead of the `thisIter`, which could lead to unexpected results when composing the two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively consumes an operation (even though it's zero-length), which could alter the state of the iterator and lead to incorrect results in the final delta composition.

DONE.
