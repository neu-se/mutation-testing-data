  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(0,0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the resulting string by removing the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the resulting string by removing the first character and shifting all other characters forward by one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the resulting string to "foo".

DONE.
