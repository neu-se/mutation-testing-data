  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error message, but if we replace it with `Q.resolve`, the promise would be resolved with the error message instead of rejected, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that depends on the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to reject the promise with an error message, but if we replace it with `Q.defer`, the promise would be resolved with a new deferred object instead of rejected, which
