 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with the argument `null`, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('An error occurred')
