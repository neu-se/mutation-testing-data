  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!result.done
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.done` is `false` when the promise is pending, but `!result.done` is `true` when the promise is pending, causing the `if` block to be executed even when the promise is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is undefined when the promise is pending, so `result.value === undefined` would be `false` when the promise is pending, causing the `if` block to be executed even when the promise is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value === 'rejected'
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is `'rejected'` when the promise is rejected, so `result.value === 'rejected'` would be `true` when the promise is rejected, causing the `if` block to be
