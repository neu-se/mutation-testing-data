  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return an empty object, even if the two objects being compared are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return the first object, even if the two objects being compared are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return the second object, even if the two objects being compared are different.

DONE.
