  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be advanced by one additional character, potentially skipping over important code or producing unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be moved back one additional character, potentially overwriting important code or producing unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 5
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor would be advanced by five additional characters, potentially skipping over important code or producing unexpected results.

DONE.
