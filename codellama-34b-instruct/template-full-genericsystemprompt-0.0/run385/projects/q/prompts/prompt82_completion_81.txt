  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to push the task onto the `laterQueue` array, as `null` is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to push the task onto the `laterQueue` array, as `undefined` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick.runAfter` method would not be able to push the task onto the `laterQueue` array, as `0` is not a valid object.

DONE.
