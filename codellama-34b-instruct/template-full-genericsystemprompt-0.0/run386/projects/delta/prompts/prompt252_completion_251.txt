  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one character from the input, regardless of the length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume the entire input, regardless of the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume one less character from the input than the original code, which could result in a different output.

DONE.
