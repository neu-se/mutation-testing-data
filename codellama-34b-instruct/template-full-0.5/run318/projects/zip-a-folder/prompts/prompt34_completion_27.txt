  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve successfully instead of rejecting with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => { throw new Error('Custom error message'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message is thrown instead of the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', (err) => { console.log(err); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is logged to the console instead of being rejected.

DONE.
