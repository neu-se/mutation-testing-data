  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` checks if the object is a promise, and `none` is a constant that holds no value, so it would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(object)` would always be truthy, so the code would always return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the code would always return `false`.

DONE.
