  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function that returns an object, while `object.inspect()` is a function call that returns the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function that returns an object, while `object.inspect.state` is a property that returns the state of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a function that returns an object, while `object.inspect.then` is a property that returns a function.

DONE.
