  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise` variable to be set to `null`, which could lead to errors in the code that relies on the `promise` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise` variable to be set to `undefined`, which could lead to errors in the code that relies on the `promise` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", "null"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise` variable to be set to the string `"null"`, which could lead to errors in the code that relies on the `promise` variable.

DONE.
