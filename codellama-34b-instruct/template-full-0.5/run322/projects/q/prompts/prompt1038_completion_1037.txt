  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object, while this new code fragment creates a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use the `then` method, while this new code fragment uses it to create a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() { throw new Error(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not use the `then` method, while this new code fragment uses it to throw an error.

DONE.
