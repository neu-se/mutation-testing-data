  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` is a string and `toLowerCase()` would return a lowercase version of the string, which could cause the code to behave differently if the string is used as a key in an object or as a parameter in a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` is a string and concatenating it with another string would result in a new string, which could cause the code to behave differently if the string is used as a key in an object or as a parameter in a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` is a string and subtracting 1 from it would result in a new string, which could cause the code to behave differently if the string is used as a key in an object or as a
