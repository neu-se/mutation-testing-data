  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects a different regular expression, which would result in a different pattern being searched for in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 this.regex = new RegExp(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]$/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new regular expression object with the global flag enabled, which would result in a different regular expression being used in the search.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex = new RegExp(/^(?:(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_\+-]\.)+
