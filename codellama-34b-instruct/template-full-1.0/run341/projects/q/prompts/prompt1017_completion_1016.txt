  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise when the dispatch call fails, while this new code fragment always rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke(object, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deferred` object to create a new promise, while this new code fragment uses `Q.ninvoke` to create a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).succeed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise when the dispatch call fails, while this new code fragment always resolves the promise.

DONE.
