 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return `null` instead of the original value when the input is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would return the incremented value instead of the original value when the input is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function would always return a promise, even when the input is not a promise. This could cause issues if the calling code does not handle promises correctly.

DONE.
