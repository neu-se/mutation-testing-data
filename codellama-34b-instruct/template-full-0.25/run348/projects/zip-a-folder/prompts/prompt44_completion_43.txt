  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a different method than `directory`, and it would cause the code to archive a single file instead of a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is passed as the second argument, which would cause the directory to be archived recursively, including all of its subdirectories and files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false, {
  filter: (src, dest) => src !== dest
})
```
This would result in different behavior because a filter function is passed as the third argument, which would cause the code to only archive files that have a different name than the source file.

DONE.
