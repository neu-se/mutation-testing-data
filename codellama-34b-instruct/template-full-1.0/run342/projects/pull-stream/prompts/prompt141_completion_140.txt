  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will throw an error when trying to invoke it with `cb()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not the same as `null`, and when used as an argument in a function call, it will evaluate to `undefined`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is not the same as `null`, and when used as an argument in a function call, it will evaluate to `undefined`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
