  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now `ref[3]`, which is not the same as `ref[2]` in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] + ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now the sum of `ref[2]` and `ref[3]`, which is not the same as `ref[2]` in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] * ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument is now the product of `ref[2]` and `ref[3]`, which is not the same as `ref[2]` in the original code fragment.

DONE.
