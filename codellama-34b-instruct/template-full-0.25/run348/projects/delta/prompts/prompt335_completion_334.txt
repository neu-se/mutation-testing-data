  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` method to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
