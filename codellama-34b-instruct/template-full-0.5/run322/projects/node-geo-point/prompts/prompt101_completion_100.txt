  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different variables representing the latitude of the point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` and `λ2` are different variables representing the longitude of the point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ` is a variable representing the bearing between the two points.

DONE.
