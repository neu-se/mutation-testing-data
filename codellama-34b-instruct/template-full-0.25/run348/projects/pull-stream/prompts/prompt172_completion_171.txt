  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `array` is not an array, while this replacement checks if it is an array. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `array` is not an array, while this replacement checks if its length is 0. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.indexOf(array[i]) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `array` is not an array, while this replacement checks if the current element in the array is not present in the array. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

DONE.
