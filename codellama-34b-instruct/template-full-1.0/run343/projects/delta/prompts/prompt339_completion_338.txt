  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over one character in the string, potentially missing a valid index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would keep the current index, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would move the index back one character, potentially reading a character that was already processed.

DONE.
