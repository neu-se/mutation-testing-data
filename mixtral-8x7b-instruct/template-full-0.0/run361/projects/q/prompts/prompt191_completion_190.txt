 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*\s+at\s+(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes possible whitespace between "at" and the filename in the regular expression, potentially matching more stack lines than the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it keeps the original implementation, but without the fix for Firefox style stack traces. It would not match Firefox style stack lines with "function@filename:lineNumber" format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*\s+@\s+(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes possible whitespace between "@" and the filename in the regular expression, potentially matching more stack lines than the original implementation.

DONE.
