  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the wrong length for the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the wrong length for the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the wrong length for the next operation.

DONE.
