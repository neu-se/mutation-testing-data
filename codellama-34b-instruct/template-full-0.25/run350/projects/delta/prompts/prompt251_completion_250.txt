  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, but it takes no arguments. By adding an argument, the code would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, but adding 1 to it would make the code skip over the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, but subtracting 1 from it would make the code go back to the previous operation.

DONE.
