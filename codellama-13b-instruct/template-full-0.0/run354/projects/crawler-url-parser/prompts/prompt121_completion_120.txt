  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Array.from` method to convert the `urlMap.values()` iterator to an array, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Array.from` method to convert the `urlMap.values()` iterator to an array and then uses the `map` method to modify the array elements. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the array elements, while the buggy code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Array.from` method to convert the `urlMap.keys()` iterator to an array, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Array.from` method to convert the `urlMap.keys()` iterator to an array and then uses the `map` method to modify the array elements. This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not
