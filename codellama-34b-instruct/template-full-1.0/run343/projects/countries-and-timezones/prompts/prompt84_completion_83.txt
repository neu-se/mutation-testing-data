  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry()` function returns the country object directly, whereas the original code fragment `c` is a single character referring to the country object. If the `getCountry()` function is replaced with `getCountry(countryId)`, the return value of the function would be assigned to `main`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezone.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone()` function returns a Timezone object, whereas the original code fragment `c` is a single character referring to the country object. If the `getTimezone()` function is replaced with `getTimezone(timezone.name)`, the return value of the function would be assigned to `main`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return country.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
