Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the operation to `retDelta`, it would remove `opLength` number of operations, potentially leading to data loss and incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly retain one more operation than intended, which could lead to an off-by-one error in the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(thisIter.next(opLength));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect merging of operations from different sources.

DONE.
