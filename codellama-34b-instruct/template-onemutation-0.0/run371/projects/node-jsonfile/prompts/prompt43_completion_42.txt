  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `stringify` function would produce different output for these two values, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not handling this edge case correctly.
