  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 degrees would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is used to convert radians to degrees, but multiplying by 180 would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 2 * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 2π radians to the angle would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

DONE.
