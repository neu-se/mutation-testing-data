Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the index of the last operation plus one, effectively adding it to the end of the array instead of the intended position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to insert the new operation at an invalid index (negative index), which could lead to unexpected results or errors in the array manipulation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation one position after the current index, potentially disrupting the intended order of operations in the `ops` array.

DONE.
