 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact value `undefined` instead of the type `'number'`. This would make the function return `undefined` when the `retain` property is not present, instead of checking for the type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type `'undefined'` instead of the type `'number'`. This would make the function return `true` when the `retain` property is not present or has a different type, instead of checking for the type `'number'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.hasOwnProperty('retain') && typeof op.retain === 'number'
