  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promises, function (promises) {
    promises = array_map(promises, Q);
    return when(all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        return when(promise, noop, noop);
    })), function () {
        return promises;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function is called instead of `onRejected` and `onProgress`, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if some of the promises are resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promises, function (promises) {
    promises = array_map(promises, Q);
    return when(all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        return when(promise, noop, noop);
    })), function () {
        return promises;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all
