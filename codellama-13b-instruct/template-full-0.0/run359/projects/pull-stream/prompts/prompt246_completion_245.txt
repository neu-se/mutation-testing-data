  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the data and null arguments. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle both arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the err argument. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle the err argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the data argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the data and err arguments. This could cause issues if the callback function is not designed to handle both arguments.

DONE.
