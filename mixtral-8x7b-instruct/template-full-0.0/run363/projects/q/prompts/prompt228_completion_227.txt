 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the element to the beginning of the array, not the end, which could change the order in which the messages are processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length of the array to 0, effectively removing all elements, instead of pushing a new message to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.messages.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `messages` array on the global `window` object, which would not have the same effect as referencing the local `messages` array.

DONE.
