 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returns `null` when it can't extract the file name and line number from the stack trace line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returns an empty string for the file name when it can't extract the file name from the stack trace line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returns `undefined` when it can't extract any information from the stack trace line.

DONE.
