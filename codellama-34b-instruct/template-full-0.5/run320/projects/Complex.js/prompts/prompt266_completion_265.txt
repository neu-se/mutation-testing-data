  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the values of `a` and `b`, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` together, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b` together, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

DONE.
