  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is not the same as `options` and may cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is not the same as `options` and may cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is not the same as `options` and may cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error.

DONE.
