  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `θ` value directly, while this option adds `Math.PI` to `θ`, which changes the resulting bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `θ` value directly, while this option doubles its value, which changes the resulting bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `θ` value directly, while this option subtracts `Math.PI` from `θ`, which changes the resulting bearing.

DONE.
