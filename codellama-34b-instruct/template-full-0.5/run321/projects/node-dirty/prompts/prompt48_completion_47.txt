  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is being replaced with `null`, which would cause the callback function to not be called when the `set` method is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is being replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the callback function to not be called when the `set` method is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` argument is being replaced with an empty function, which would cause the callback function to not be called when the `set` method is invoked.

DONE.
