Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs the data as an error message instead of a standard log message, which may not be captured by tests expecting standard output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to add 1 to the data, which could lead to unexpected results if `data` is not a number, potentially causing a type coercion issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the data to a string before logging, which may change the output format and could lead to tests failing if they expect the original data type.

DONE.
