  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value is not an array and will not have the expected behavior when used in the `nfcall` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value is not an array and will not have the expected behavior when used in the `nfcall` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a valid but different value compared to the `arguments` object, and would cause different behavior in the `nfcall` function.

DONE.
