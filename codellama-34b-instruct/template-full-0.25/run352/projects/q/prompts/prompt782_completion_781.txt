  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` function to return a promise that is always fulfilled with the value `regardless`, regardless of the state of the input promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("regardless")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` function to return a promise that is always rejected with the error "regardless", regardless of the state of the input promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` function to return a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the input promise at the specified index, regardless of the state of the input promises.

DONE.
