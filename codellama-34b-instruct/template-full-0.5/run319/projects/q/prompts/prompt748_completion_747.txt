  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, causing the `onFulfilled` function to be skipped and the `onRejected` function to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, causing the `onProgress` function to be called instead of the `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of the value returned by the `onFulfilled` function, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

DONE.
