  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` parameter is set to `'zip'` instead of `'tar'`, which would cause the function to create a zip archive instead of a tar archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` parameter is set to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed` instead of the default `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high`, which would cause the function to create an uncompressed tar archive instead of a compressed one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {
