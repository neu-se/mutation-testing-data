  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `null` is a distinct value that is not equivalent to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `undefined` is a distinct value that is not equivalent to `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, while `NaN` is a distinct value that is not equivalent to `undefined`.

DONE.
