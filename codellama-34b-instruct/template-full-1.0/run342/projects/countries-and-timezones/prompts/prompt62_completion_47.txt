  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-id
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `id` variable is used to access the `country` object. However, with the mutated code, the `-id` is used to access the `country` object instead. This could potentially cause bugs in the program if the `country` object does not have a property with the negative value of the `id` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `id` variable is used as is to access the `country` object. However, with the mutated code, the `id` variable is converted to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method before being used to access the `country` object. This could potentially cause bugs in the program if the `country` object does not have a property that corresponds to the lowercased value of the `id` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
