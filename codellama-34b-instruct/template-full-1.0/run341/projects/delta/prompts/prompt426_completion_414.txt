  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` function to return the length of the `op.retain` property, which is not necessarily the same as the length of the `op.delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` function to return 0 if `op.delete` is 0, instead of returning the length of the `op.insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.insert === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` function to return 0 if `op.insert` is undefined, instead of returning the length of the `op.delete` property.

DONE.
