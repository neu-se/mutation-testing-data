  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in the same behavior and return the same value as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in the opposite behavior and return the opposite value as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable x is incremented by 1 before being passed to the cosh function, which would cause a different angle to be passed to the function.

DONE.
