  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `callback` is truthy, regardless of whether `callback.apply` is a function or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `callback` is falsy, regardless of whether `callback.apply` is a function or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `callback` is truthy and `callback.apply` is a function, regardless of whether the `callback` function is actually callable.

DONE.
