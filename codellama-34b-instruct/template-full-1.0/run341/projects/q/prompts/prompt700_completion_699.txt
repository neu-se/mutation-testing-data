  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.splice(0)` would return an empty array, while `args.concat` would return a new array with the elements of `args` concatenated with the elements of the array returned by `array_slice(arguments, 2)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return an array with the elements of `args` from the second element to the end, while `args.concat` would return a new array with the elements of `args` concatenated with the elements of the array returned by `array_slice(arguments, 2)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.pop()` would return the last element of `args`, while `args.concat` would concatenate the elements of `args
