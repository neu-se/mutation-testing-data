  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<debugger;>
```
This would result in the code breaking and going into the debugger when the condition is met, causing the code to behave differently than when the original `pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)` is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<pageurl_path.length === linkurl_path.length>
```
This would result in the code behaving differently because the condition would be true only when the lengths of the two strings are the same, whereas the original condition would be true for any substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<new RegExp(linkurl_path).test(pageurl_path)>
```
This would result in the code behaving differently because it uses a regular expression to test for the presence of the substring, whereas the original condition uses the `includes` method, which is different.

DONE.
