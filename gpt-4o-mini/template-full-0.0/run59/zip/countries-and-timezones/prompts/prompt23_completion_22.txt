Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value for the UTC offset, ignoring any negative offsets that indicate time zones west of UTC.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(utcOffset + 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add 60 minutes to the UTC offset before formatting it, potentially misrepresenting the actual time zone offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the daylight saving time offset by 1 minute, leading to an inaccurate representation of the DST offset.

DONE.
