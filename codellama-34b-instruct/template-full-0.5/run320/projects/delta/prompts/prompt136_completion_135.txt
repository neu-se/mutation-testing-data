  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < start || index >= end) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `index` is less than `start` or greater than or equal to `end`, while this modified code checks if `index` is less than `start` or greater than `end`. This would cause the loop to iterate one extra time when `index` is equal to `end`, potentially leading to an off-by-one error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < start || index > end) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `index` is less than `start` or greater than or equal to `end`, while this modified code checks if `index` is less than `start` or greater than `end`. This would cause the loop to iterate one less time when `index` is equal to `end`, potentially leading to an off-by-one error.
