  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace every 'e' in the word with 'a', while the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 function(w) { return w.replace(/[aeiou]/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace every vowel in the word with 'a', while the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'a' + 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace every 'a' in the word with 'ae', while the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of 'a' with 'e'.

DONE.
