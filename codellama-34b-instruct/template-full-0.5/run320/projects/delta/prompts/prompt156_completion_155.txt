  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to execute one more iteration, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to execute one fewer iteration, potentially resulting in a missing iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to execute one fewer iteration, potentially resulting in a missing iteration.

DONE.
