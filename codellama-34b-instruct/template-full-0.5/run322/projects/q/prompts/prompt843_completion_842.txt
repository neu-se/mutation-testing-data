  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by 1000 milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected later than it would have been with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by 1000 milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected earlier than it would have been with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be set to 0, causing the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of the outcome of the promise.

DONE.
