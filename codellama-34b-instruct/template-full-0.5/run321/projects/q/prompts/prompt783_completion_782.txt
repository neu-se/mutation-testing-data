  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(rejected, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected, and would also ignore any progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always ignore any fulfillment or rejection of the promise, and would also ignore any progress notifications.

DONE.
