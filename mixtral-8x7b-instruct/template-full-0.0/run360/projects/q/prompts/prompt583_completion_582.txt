 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now wrapped in a resolved promise, so it won't be invoked immediately. Instead, it will be invoked in the next tick, which might cause tests that expect the immediate invocation of the callback to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now wrapped in a Q-specific resolved promise, which might have different behavior than the native Promise.resolve. This could cause tests that assume specific behavior of the resolved promise to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(callback, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now scheduled to run in the next event loop iteration using setTimeout. This could cause tests that assume the immediate invocation of the callback to fail.

DONE.
