  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData !== otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `thisData` and `otherData` are not equal, rather than checking if they are both objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData || otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, making the inner code execute regardless of the types of `thisData` and `otherData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(thisData) !== Object.prototype.toString.call(otherData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the string representations of `thisData` and `otherData`, rather than checking if they are both objects.

DONE.
