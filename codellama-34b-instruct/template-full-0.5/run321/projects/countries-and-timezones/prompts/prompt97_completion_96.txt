  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `getTimezone` function calls itself recursively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return a different result than the original code fragment, which would cause the `getTimezonesForCountry` function to return a different result.

DONE.
