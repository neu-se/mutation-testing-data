  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will change the sign of the variable, which could cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator will change the value of the variable, which could cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root function will change the value of the variable, which could cause the expression to evaluate to a different value.

DONE.
