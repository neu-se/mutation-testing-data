  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function is called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function is called with a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than being called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function is called with a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than being called immediately.

DONE.
