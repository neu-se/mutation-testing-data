  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `mapper` is not null, while this replacement code is checking if the `mapper` is null. If the `mapper` is null, the original code would return `id`, while this replacement code would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof mapper !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `mapper` is not a function, while this replacement code is checking if `mapper` is not of type function. If `mapper` is not a function, the original code would return `id`, while this replacement code would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(mapper, 'simple')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the `mapper` object has an own property called `
