  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length < 2
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `else` block when `a` is an array with less than 2 elements, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length > 2
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `else` block when `a` is an array with more than 2 elements, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 3
```
This change will cause the code to enter the `else` block when `a` is an array with exactly 3 elements, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
