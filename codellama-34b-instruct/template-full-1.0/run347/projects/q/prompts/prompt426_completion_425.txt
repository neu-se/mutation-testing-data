  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error before the promise is returned, causing the promise to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason object instead of a promise, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined instead of a promise, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
