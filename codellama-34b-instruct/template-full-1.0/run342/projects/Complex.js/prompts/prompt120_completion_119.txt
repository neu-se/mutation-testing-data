  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (true) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always be true, causing the program to always return Complex['NAN'].

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always be false, causing the program to always return Complex['INFINITY'].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ('a' === 'b') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `"a" === "b"` would always be false, causing the program to always return Complex['NAN'].

DONE.
