  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This change will cause the `readFileSync` function to always execute the `try` block, even if the `options` argument is a string. This could potentially cause the function to throw an error if the `options` argument is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'
```
This change will cause the `readFileSync` function to only execute the `try` block if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is set to `'utf8'`. This could potentially cause the function to throw an error if the `encoding` property is not set to `'utf8'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding !== 'utf8'
```
This change will cause the `readFileSync` function to only execute the `try` block if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is not set to `'utf8'`. This could potentially
