  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the letter "c" as an additional match, which would cause the function to return a different result for words that end in "ch".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to remove the "i" flag, which would cause the function to return a different result for words that end in "ch" when the word is in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to
