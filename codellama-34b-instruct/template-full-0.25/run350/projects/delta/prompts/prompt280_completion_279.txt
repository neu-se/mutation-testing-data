  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and the `retain` method is called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `thisOp.retain`, and the `retain` method is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain`, and the `retain` method is called with a different argument.

DONE.
