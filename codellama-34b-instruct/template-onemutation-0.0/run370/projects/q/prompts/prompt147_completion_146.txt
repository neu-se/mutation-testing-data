  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stackCounter` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to concatenate the stack trace of `promise` with the error stack trace, even if the error is not a `StopIteration` exception.
