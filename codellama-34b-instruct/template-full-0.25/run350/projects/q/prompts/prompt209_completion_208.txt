  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this` inside the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this` inside the callback function to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this` inside the callback function to `undefined`.

DONE.
