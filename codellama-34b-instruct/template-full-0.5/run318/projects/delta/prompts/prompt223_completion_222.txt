  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first element of the `strings` array instead of the second element, which is the correct one for the `diff` function to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the third element of the `strings` array instead of the second element, which is the correct one for the `diff` function to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `strings` array instead of the second element, which is the correct one for the `diff` function to work correctly.

DONE.
