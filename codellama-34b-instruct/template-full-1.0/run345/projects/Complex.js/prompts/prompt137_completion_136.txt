  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isInfinite() && z.isInfinite()) {
  return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this` is infinite, whereas this code checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.isInfinite() || z.isInfinite()) {
  return Complex.NAN;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite, whereas this code checks if either `this` or `z` are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z.isInfinite()) {
  return Complex.INFINITY;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite, whereas this code only checks if `z
