  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.reverse()` method would modify the array in place and return a reference to the modified array, which may not be the desired behavior if the original code expects the array to be unmodified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property is set to 0, which would truncate the array to have zero elements, regardless of its original length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.push(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.push()` method appends a new element to the end of the array, causing its length to increase.

DONE.
