  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the square root function, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the reciprocal of the square root function, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the absolute value function, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
