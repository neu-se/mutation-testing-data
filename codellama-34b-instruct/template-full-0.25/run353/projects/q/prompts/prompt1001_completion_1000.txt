  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
