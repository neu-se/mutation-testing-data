  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while the new code checks if it's an object. This could cause the `retain` branch to be taken when it should be the `insert` branch, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while the new code checks if it's undefined. This could cause the `retain` branch to be taken when it should be the `insert` branch, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while the new code checks if it's a number.
