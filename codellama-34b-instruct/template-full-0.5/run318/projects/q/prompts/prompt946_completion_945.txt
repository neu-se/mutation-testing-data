  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined in the `deferred` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined in the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined in the `deferred` object.

DONE.
