  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `value instanceof Promise` checks if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` class, while `value === Promise` checks if `value` is the `Promise` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `.constructor` is a getter method that returns the constructor function of an object, so it would return the `Promise` function if `value` is constructed by `Promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "Promise.prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof value` checks if the string representation of `value`'s type is "Promise.prototype".

DONE.
