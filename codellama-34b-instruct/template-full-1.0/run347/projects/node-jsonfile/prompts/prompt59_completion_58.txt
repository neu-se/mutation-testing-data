  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code with a buggy code fragment that exhibits different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\n` sequence is not a valid regular expression pattern and will cause a syntax error when used as a replacement pattern for `String.prototype.replace`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern will match a carriage return and newline sequence instead of a newline character, which could cause a failure in the `stripBom` function if the `content` string does not contain a carriage return character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'(\r\n|\n|\r)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement pattern will match a carriage return and newline sequence, a newline character, or a carriage return character, which could cause a failure in the `stripBom
