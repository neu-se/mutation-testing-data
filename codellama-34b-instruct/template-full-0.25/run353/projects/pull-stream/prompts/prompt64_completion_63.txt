  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` or `false`, but this replacement checks if `end` is `true` or any other value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === false ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` or `false`, but this replacement checks if `end` is `false` or any other value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end !== true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true` or `false`, but this replacement checks if `end` is not `true` or any other value.

DONE.
