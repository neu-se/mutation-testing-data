  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it may not handle the input arguments in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise.bind(null, universalify.fromCallback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise.bind(null, universalify.fromCallback)` creates a new function that is bound to the `universalify.fromCallback` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => universalify.fromPromise(universalify.fromCallback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => universalify.fromPromise(universalify.fromCallback)` creates a new function that returns a promise that resolves to the result of `universalify.fromCallback`,
