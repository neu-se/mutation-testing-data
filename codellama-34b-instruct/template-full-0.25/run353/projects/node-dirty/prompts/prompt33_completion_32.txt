  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same behavior as `undefined` when used as a parameter in the `set` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it would not have the same behavior as `undefined` when used as a parameter in the `set` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and it would not have the same behavior as `undefined` when used as a parameter in the `set` method.

DONE.
