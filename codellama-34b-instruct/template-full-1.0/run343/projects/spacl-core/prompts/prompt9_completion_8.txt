  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\s+]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any whitespace character instead of just the literal forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\.*\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character before and after the forward slash, including forward slashes themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\+\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character before the forward slash, including forward slashes themselves, and it would not match the forward slash itself.
