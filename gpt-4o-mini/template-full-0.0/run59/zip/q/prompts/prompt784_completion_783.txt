Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `undefined` would change the resolved value of the promise, potentially leading to unexpected results in promise chains that rely on the resolved value being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Promise rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error instead of resolving successfully, which would affect any subsequent `.catch` handlers that are expecting a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `this` would cause the promise to resolve with the original promise object itself, which could lead to confusion in promise chains that expect a different resolved value.

DONE.
