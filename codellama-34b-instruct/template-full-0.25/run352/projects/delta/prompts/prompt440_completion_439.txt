  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this code checks if it is not a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this code checks the length of `nextOp.insert`. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.insert` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.substr(offset, length) !== nextOp.insert.substr(0, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.insert` is a string, while this code checks if the substring of `nextOp
