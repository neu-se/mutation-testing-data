 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*\s+at\s+(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes possible whitespace between "at" and the filename in the regular expression, potentially matching more stack lines than the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically looks for "@" instead of a more general whitespace character followed by "at", potentially not matching stack lines that don't contain "@".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*\s+in\s+(.+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it looks for "in" instead of "at", potentially not matching stack lines that contain "at".

DONE.
