  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code block when the `result[country]` property is undefined, whereas the original code would execute the code block for any falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]?.current
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code block when the `result[country].current` property exists and is truthy, whereas the original code would execute the code block for any falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]?.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code block when the `result[country].all` property exists and is truthy, whereas the original code would execute the code block for any falsy value.

DONE.
