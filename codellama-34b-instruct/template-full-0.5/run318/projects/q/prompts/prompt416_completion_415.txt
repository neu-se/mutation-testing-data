  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.then()` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `object` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.catch()` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with a reason, whereas `object` is a promise that may be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.finally()` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the original value, whereas `object` is a promise that may be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
