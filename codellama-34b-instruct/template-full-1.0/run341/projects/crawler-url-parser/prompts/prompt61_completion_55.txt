  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the base URL in the formatted URL, while the original code does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedUrl.hostname + parsedUrl.port)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the path and query string from the URL, while the original code keeps them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(baseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the relative pathname of the current URL against the base URL, while the original code does not.

DONE.
