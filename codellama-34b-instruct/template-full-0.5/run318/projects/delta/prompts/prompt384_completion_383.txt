  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to retain one more character than it should, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the code to retain one fewer character than it should, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain a different number of characters than it should, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.

DONE.
