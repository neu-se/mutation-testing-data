  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument, which would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would be called with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the `deferred.reject` function instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be called with the `deferred.resolve` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `deferred.resolve` function instead of the
