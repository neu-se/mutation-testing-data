  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: index }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `value` property to the index of the current promise in the array, rather than the progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `value` property to the progress value plus one, rather than the progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `value` property to the progress value minus one, rather than the progress value.

DONE.
