  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is zero, but passing `0` as an argument would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is infinite, but calling it without an argument would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), but calling it without an argument would always return `false`, even if the complex number is actually NaN.

DONE.
