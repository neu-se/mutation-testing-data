  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source` is a different object than `s`, and the `sink` method may not be defined on `s.source`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink(read)` would call the `sink` method on `s` with `read` as an argument, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source.sink(read)` would call the `sink` method on `s.source` with `read` as an argument, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
