  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the opLength value would be incremented, potentially causing the code to access an invalid index in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the opLength value would be decremented, potentially causing the code to skip over an important operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the opLength value would be doubled, potentially causing the code to perform the operation twice or to skip over an important operation.

DONE.
