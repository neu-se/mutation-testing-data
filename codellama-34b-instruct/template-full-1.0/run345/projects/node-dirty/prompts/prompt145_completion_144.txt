  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific error message, whereas this modified code would emit an error event with a different error message (not specific to the database).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Something wrong happened'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific error message, whereas this modified code would emit an error event with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', {message: 'Something wrong happened'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific error message, whereas this modified code would emit an error event with a different error message (but same error type).

DONE.
