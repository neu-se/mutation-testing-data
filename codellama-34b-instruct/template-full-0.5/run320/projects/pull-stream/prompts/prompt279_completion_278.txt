  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `true` if `prop` is falsy, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `prop` is a function that returns a value, so `!prop` would always be `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.call()` is a method that calls the `prop` function with the current `this` value as its first argument, and any additional arguments passed to `call` as subsequent arguments. In the original code, `prop` is not called as a method, so `prop.call()` would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.apply()` is a method that calls the `prop` function with the current `this` value as its first argument,
