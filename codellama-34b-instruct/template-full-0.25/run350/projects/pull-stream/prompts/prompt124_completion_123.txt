  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` while this code decrements it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1 while this code increments it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1 while this code increments it by 10.

DONE.
