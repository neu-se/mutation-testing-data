Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 || _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `_a` or `_b` is greater than 3000, which is the opposite condition of the original check that ensures both values are less than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a === 3000 && _b === 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it only returns true if both `_a` and `_b` are exactly equal to 3000, whereas the original condition allows for values less than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `_a` or `_b` is less than 3000, which would allow the function to proceed even if one of the values exceeds 3000, contrary to the original requirement that both must be below that threshold.

DONE.
