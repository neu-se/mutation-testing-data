  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which multiplies the imaginary part of the complex number by 2, while the new code fragment multiplies the real part of the complex number by 2. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part, and therefore different behavior.

DONE.
