  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a different function than `object_toString`, and it would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_defineProperty` is a different function than `object_toString`, and it would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_keys` is a different function than `object_toString`, and it would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return a different value.

DONE.
