  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise and returns it, while `bound` is a function that returns a bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise and returns it, while `bound` is a function that returns a bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("different error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a different error than the original function.

DONE.
