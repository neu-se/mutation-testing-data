  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op instead of the base op, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the current op instead of the base op, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op instead of the current op, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
