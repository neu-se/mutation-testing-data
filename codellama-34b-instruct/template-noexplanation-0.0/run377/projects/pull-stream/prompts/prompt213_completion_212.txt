  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` as an argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with the `aborted` variable as an argument, which is the original behavior.

DONE.
