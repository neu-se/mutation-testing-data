  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");`, which throws an error if the callback is not a function, while the new code fragment throws an error unconditionally, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the callback is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return promise.fcall().then(function () { return value; });`, which returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, while the new code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with `null`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `null` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Q can't apply finally callback"));
```
This would result in different behavior
