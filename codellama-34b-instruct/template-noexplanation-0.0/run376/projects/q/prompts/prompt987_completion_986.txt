  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This code fragment adds an extra `null` argument to the `post` method, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, undefined]
```
This code fragment adds an extra `undefined` argument to the `post` method, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "foo"]
```
This code fragment adds an extra string argument `"foo"` to the `post` method, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
