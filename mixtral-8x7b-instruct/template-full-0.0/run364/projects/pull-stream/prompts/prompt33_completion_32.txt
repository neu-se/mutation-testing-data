 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of the function would be the original `read` value plus 1, instead of just the original `read` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of the function would be the boolean negation of `read`, instead of just the original `read` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of the function would be a string representation of `read`, instead of just the original `read` value.

DONE.
