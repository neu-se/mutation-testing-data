  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(c => c.timezones.length > 0).map(c => c.timezones[0]);
```
This code fragment filters out countries that do not have any timezones, and then maps each country to its first timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(c => c.timezones[0]).filter(tz => tz !== undefined);
```
This code fragment maps each country to its first timezone, and then filters out any undefined values that may have been returned by the map function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce((acc, c) => acc.concat(c.timezones), []);
```
This code fragment reduces the array of countries to a single array of timezones, by concatenating the timezones of each country.

DONE.
