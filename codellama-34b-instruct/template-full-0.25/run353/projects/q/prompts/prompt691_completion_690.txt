  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments of the function.

DONE.
