  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while the original code only returns `true` if both are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while the original code only returns `false` if both are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() !== z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `this` and `z` have different infinities, while the original code only returns `true` if both are infinite.

DONE.
