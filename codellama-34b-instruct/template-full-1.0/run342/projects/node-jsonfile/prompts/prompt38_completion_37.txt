  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `fromPromise` returns a promise-based function, while `fromCallback` returns a callback-based function. Using `fromPromise` would cause the `writeFile` function to return a promise instead of calling the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fromAsync` returns an async function, while `fromCallback` returns a callback-based function. Using `fromAsync` would cause the `writeFile` function to return a promise instead of calling the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because `fromMethod` returns a method-based function, while `fromCallback` returns a callback-based function. Using `fromMethod` would cause the `writeFile` function to return a method instead of calling the callback.

DONE
