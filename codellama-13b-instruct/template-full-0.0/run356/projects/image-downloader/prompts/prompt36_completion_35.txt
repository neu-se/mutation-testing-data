  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to instead of overwritten. This could cause the file to grow in size over time, which could be a problem if the file is expected to be small.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```

This could cause the file to be written in a different format, which could be a problem if the file is expected to be in a specific format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { mode: 0o666 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode
