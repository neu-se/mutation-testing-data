  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `parseFloat` function to parse the next token in the string, but the new code fragment is using the `parseFloat` function to parse the current token, which could result in a different value being parsed.

DONE.
