 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `.has` only checks if a key exists in the map, but does not update the value associated with that key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.delete
