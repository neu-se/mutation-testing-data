  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the embed type to be converted to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues if the embed type is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the embed type to be concatenated with the string 'foo', which could potentially cause issues if the embed type is used as a key in a map or as a parameter to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the embed type to be returned, which could potentially cause issues if the length of the embed type is used as a parameter to a function or as a condition for a loop.

DONE.
