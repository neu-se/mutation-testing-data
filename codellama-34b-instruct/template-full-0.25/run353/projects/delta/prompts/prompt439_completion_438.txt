  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is a number. If `nextOp.retain` is an object, the original code would return `retain: nextOp.retain`, but this replacement would return `retain: length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is a string. If `nextOp.retain` is an object, the original code would return `retain: nextOp.retain`, but this replacement would return `retain: length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
