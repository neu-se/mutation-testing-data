  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first element of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat(["extra"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an additional element to the `dispatch` method, which would not be present in the original code.

DONE.
