  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would be passed as the `this` context to the `progressed` function, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would be passed as the `this` context to the `progressed` function, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise` object, and it would be passed as the `this` context to the `progressed` function, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
