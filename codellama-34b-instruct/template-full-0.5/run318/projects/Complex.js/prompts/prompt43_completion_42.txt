  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `b` is null, rather than `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null || b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `b` is undefined, rather than `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined || b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is not undefined or `b` is not null, rather than checking if `a` is undefined or `b` is null.

DONE.
