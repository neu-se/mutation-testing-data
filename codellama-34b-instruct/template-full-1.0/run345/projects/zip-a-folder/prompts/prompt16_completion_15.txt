  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `access` is a function that checks if a file exists and can be accessed, while `writeFile` is a function that writes data to a file. Using `writeFile` instead of `access` would cause the code to actually write to the file, which may not be desirable in all situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `access` is a function that checks if a file exists and can be accessed, while `readFile` is a function that reads the contents of a file. Using `readFile` instead of `access` would cause the code to read from the file instead of checking its existence and permissions, which may not be desirable in all situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.unlink
```
This would result in different behavior because `access` is a function that
