  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the literal string "\n" instead of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\\r\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the literal string "\r\n" instead of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\\u000A'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the literal string "\u000A" instead of the newline character.

DONE.
