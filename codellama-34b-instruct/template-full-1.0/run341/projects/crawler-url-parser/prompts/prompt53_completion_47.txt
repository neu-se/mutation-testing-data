  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a property of `parsedUrl` and not `parsedBaseUrl`, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is a property of `parsedUrl` and not `parsedBaseUrl`, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a property of `parsedUrl` and not `parsedBaseUrl`, so it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
