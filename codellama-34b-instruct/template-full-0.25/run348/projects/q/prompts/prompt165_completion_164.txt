  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never execute, as the loop condition would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to execute one extra time, as the loop condition would be true one extra time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to execute one less time, as the loop condition would be false one less time.

DONE.
