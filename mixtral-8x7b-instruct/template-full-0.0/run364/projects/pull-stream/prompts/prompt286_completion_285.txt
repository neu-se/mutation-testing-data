 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` would not be assigned a new value when `end` is true, and it would always return the original data to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` would not be assigned a new value when `end` is true, and it would always return `undefined` to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `end` variable as an argument to the `mapper` function, which was not the case in the original code. This could potentially cause the `mapper` function to behave differently.

DONE.
