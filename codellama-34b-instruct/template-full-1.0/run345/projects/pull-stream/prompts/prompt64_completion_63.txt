  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes an `err` and `cb` argument, whereas `done` is a function that takes only an `err` argument. By replacing `done` with `abort`, the function would be using the wrong argument order, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, meaning that the function would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, meaning that the function would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
