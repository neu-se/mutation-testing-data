  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in the current scope, and would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with the global object instead of the `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `this` argument to the `rejected` callback, which would cause the callback to be called with a different `this` value than the original code.

DONE.
