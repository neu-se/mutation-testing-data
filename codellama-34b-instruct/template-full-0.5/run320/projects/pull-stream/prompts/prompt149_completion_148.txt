  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the object's own enumerable property names, whereas `object` is an object and would be treated as such by the `values()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the object's own enumerable property names, and `Object.keys(object)[0]` would return the first property name in that array, whereas `object` is an object and would be treated as such by the `values()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the object's own enumerable property names, and `Object.keys(object).length` would return the number of properties in that array
