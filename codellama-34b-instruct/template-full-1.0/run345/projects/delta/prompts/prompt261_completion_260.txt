  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.withDiff
```
This would result in different behavior because the "withDiff" method is not defined in the AttributeMap class, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  () => AttributeMap.diff
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the "diff" method itself, rather than calling it, which would likely cause unexpected results in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "diff" method immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to the "retain" method, which would likely cause unexpected results in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
