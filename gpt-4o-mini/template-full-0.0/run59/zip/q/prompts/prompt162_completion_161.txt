Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(",")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter from a newline character to a comma, which would incorrectly split the stack trace lines, potentially merging multiple lines into a single entry.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter to a space, which would not correctly separate the stack trace lines, leading to a loss of information and incorrect formatting of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n").reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it not only splits the stack trace by newlines but also reverses the order of the lines, which could confuse the stack trace representation and make it harder to trace the error's origin.

DONE.
