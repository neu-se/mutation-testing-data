  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function expects a stream as its first argument, but `null` is not a stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function expects a stream as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function expects a stream as its first argument, but `{}` is not a stream.

DONE.
