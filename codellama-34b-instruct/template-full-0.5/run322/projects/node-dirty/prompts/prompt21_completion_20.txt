  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the queue instead of adding the callback to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing callbacks in the queue with the new ones, instead of adding them to the end of the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [...cbs, cb]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the new callback to the beginning of the queue instead of the end.

DONE.
