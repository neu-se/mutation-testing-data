  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs)` would not be wrapped in a promise, which would cause the `fail` method to not be called if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs)).fail(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs)` would be wrapped in a promise, but the `fail` method would not be called if an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs)).fail(deferred.reject).then(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply(thisp, nodeArgs)` would be wrapped in a promise, and the `fail` method would be called if an error occurs, but the `
