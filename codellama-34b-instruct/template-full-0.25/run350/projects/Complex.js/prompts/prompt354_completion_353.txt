  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `a + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `a * 2`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while the modified code fragment uses `a - 1`, which is a different value.

DONE.
