 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|s(?:tud|pectacle|hort))\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes an additional word 'shorte' in the misc array, which should not have a plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|s(?:tud|pectacle|hort|horts))\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes an incorrect plural form 'sshorts' for the word 'shorte'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|s(?:tud|pectacle|hort|h
