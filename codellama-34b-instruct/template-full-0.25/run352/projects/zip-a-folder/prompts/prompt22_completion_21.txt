  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is truthy, while this code checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists and the `customWriteStream` property is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is truthy, while this code checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is truthy, while this code checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is not null.

DONE.
