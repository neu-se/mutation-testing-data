  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise for a result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise for an array of results, whereas `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise for a single result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise for a result.

DONE.
