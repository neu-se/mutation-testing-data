  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because now the second to last operation is excluded from the concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because now only the last operation is included in the concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(...other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `slice` method to create a shallow copy of the array, whereas this option is using the `concat`
 method to create a new array that contains the same elements as `other.ops`.

DONE.
