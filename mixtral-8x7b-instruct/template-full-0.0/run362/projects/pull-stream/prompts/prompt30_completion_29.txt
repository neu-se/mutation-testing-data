 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the fourth argument instead of the third one, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or using incorrect data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from the `ref` array instead of accessing the third element, potentially causing unexpected data manipulation or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `ref` array and shifts all other elements, potentially causing unexpected data manipulation or incorrect behavior.

These mutations change the behavior of the code by modifying the way the `ref` array is accessed or manipulated, which can lead to unintended consequences in the execution of the program. By introducing these changes, we can test the effectiveness of the existing test suite in catching potential
