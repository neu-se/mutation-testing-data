  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind = function (/*thisp, ...args*/) {
    var args = array_slice(arguments, 0);
    args.unshift(this);
    return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would be overwritten, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind = function (/*thisp, ...args*/) {
    var args = array_slice(arguments, 0);
    args.unshift(this);
    return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
};
```
