 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the first operation in the delta instead of the last one. This could cause the `diff` method to behave differently, especially if the delta contains multiple operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
newOp, delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the operations being compared. This could cause the `diff` method to behave differently, especially if the order of the operations matters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.ops[Math.floor(Math.random() * delta.ops.length)], newOp
