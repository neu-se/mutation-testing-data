  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" to the end of the word, while this new fragment adds "es" to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" to the end of the word, while this new fragment adds "ice" to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('mouse', 'mouse')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "s" to the end of the word, while this new fragment does not add any letters to the end of the word.

DONE.
