Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a non-existent `resolve` method on the promise object instead of the intended `dispatch` method, leading to a runtime error when trying to delete a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `then` method instead of `dispatch`, which is not appropriate for handling property deletion and would likely result in unexpected behavior or failure to execute the intended operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this["delete"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access a property named `"delete"` on the promise object, which is not the correct method for dispatching operations, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

DONE.
