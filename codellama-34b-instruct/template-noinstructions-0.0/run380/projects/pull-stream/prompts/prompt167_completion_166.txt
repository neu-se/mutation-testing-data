  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while the replacement code fragment `abort` is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call, while the replacement code fragment `abort()` is a function call with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function call with no arguments, while the replacement code fragment `abort(true)` is a function call with one argument.

DONE.
