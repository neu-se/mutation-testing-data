  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `_read` function to be called with an error, which would then be propagated to the `read` function. However, replacing it with `null` would cause the `_read` function to be called with no error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `_read` function to be called with an error, which would then be propagated to the `read` function. However, replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `_read` function to be called with no error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `_read` function to be called with an error, which would then be propagated to the
