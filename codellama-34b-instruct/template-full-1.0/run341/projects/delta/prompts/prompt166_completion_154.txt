  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(firstOther.retain - firstLeft <= 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not run the line of code that pushes the nextOp to ops if the condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(otherIter.peekType() === 'delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not run the lines of code that handle the 'insert' and 'retain' types, and instead run the lines of code that handle the 'delete' type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(otherIter.hasNext())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not run the lines of code that handle the 'insert' and 'retain' types, and instead run the lines of code that handle the 'delete' type.

DONE.
