  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `a` and `z['re']` together, whereas the original code fragment used the `,` operator to create a tuple.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply `a` and `z['re']` together, whereas the original code fragment used the `,` operator to create a tuple.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract `z['re']` from `a`, whereas the original code fragment used the `,` operator to create a tuple.

DONE.
