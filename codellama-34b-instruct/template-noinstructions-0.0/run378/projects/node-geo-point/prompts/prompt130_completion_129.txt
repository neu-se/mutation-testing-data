  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null would cause a null pointer exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with non-zero coordinates, but a GeoPoint object with zero coordinates would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.longitude, this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with different coordinates, but a GeoPoint object with the same coordinates would cause the calculation to produce the same results.

DONE.
