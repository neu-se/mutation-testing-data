  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.bind(this)` returns a bound function, whereas `this.then` returns the result of calling the `then` method on `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.call(this)` calls the `then` method on `this` with `this` as the context object, whereas `this.then` returns the result of calling the `then` method on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.apply(this)` calls the `then` method on `this` with `this` as the context object and an empty argument list, whereas `this.then` returns the result of calling the `then` method on `this`.
