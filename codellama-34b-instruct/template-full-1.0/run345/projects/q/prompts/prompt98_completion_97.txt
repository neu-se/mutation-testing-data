  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to execute a different number of times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <<= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other index, causing the loop to execute a different number of times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index %= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute on the even indexes, causing the loop to execute a different number of times.

DONE.
