  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fromGeoJSON` method to accept any object with a `type` property that is not equal to `'Point'`, rather than only accepting objects with a `type` property that is exactly equal to `'Point'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'MultiPoint'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fromGeoJSON` method to accept any object with a `type` property that is not equal to `'Point'` or `'MultiPoint'`, rather than only accepting objects with a `type` property that is exactly equal to `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.type !== 'MultiPoint' && point.type !== 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `fromGeo
