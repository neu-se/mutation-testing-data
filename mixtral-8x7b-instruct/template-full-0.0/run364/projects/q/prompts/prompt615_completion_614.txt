 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects a valid object and passing `null` would cause a TypeError when trying to access the `dispatch` method on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects a valid object and passing an array would cause a TypeError when trying to access the `dispatch` method on `[]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'string'
