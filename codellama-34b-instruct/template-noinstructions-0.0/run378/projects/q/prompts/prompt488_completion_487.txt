  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to not work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the promise to the unhandled rejections array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work correctly.

DONE.
