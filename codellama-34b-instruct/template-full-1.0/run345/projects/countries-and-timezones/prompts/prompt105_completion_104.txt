  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key][2] }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the third character of the timezone string instead of the whole string, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the timezone string instead of the string itself, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].name }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone instead of the whole string, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
