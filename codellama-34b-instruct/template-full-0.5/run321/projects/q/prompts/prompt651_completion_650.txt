  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is expected to receive a string representing the method to be invoked on the object, and "put" is not a valid method for the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is expected to receive a string representing the method to be invoked on the object, and "resolve" is not a valid method for the `Promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"reject"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is expected to receive a string representing the method to be invoked on the object, and "reject" is not a valid method for the `Promise` object.

DONE.
