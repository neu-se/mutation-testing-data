  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the incorrect value for the tangent, resulting in a wrong outcome for the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the tangent, resulting in a wrong outcome for the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value for the tangent, resulting in a wrong outcome for the calculation.

DONE.
