  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function definition. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function definition would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function definition. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function definition would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function definition. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the function definition would not be called.

DONE.
