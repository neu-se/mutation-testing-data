  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have a parameter, but the modified code fragment has a parameter of 1, which would cause the parser to exit with an error code of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have a parameter, but the modified code fragment has a parameter of "error", which would cause the parser to exit with an error message of "error".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not have a parameter, but the modified code fragment has a parameter of a new Error object with the message "error", which would cause the parser to exit with an error object that has the message "error".

DONE.
