  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by a different amount than the original code, which could cause the iteration to skip over certain elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one more element than the original code, which could cause the iteration to include an extra element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one fewer element than the original code, which could cause the iteration to exclude an element.

DONE.
