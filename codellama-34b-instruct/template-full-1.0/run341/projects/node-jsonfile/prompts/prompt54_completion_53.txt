  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would cause the JSON.stringify method to serialize the object without adding any space characters to the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the plus sign would cause the JSON.stringify method to add an extra space character to the result, which would change the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the asterisk sign would cause the JSON.stringify method to add twice as many space characters to the result, which would change the resulting string.

DONE.
