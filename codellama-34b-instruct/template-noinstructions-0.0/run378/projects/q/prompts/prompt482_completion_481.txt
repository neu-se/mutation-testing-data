  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, while the new code fragment would remove the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, while the new code fragment would remove the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, while the new code fragment would remove the second element.

DONE.
