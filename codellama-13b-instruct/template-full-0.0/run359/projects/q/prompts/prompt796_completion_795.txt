  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a single argument, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes no arguments. This would cause the promise to be rejected with an error message indicating that the function is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (progress) {
    console.log(progress);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a single argument, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes a single argument and logs it to the console. This would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the progress value, rather than being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (progress) {
    return progress;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a single argument, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes a single argument and returns it. This
