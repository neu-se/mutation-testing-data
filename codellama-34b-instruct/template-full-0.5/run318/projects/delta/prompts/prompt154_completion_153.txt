  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would always return `true`, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method would always return `'delete'`, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would always return `true`, causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
