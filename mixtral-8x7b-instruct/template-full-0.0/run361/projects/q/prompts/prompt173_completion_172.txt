 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
desiredLines = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `desiredLines` array would be reset in each iteration, discarding the lines collected so far.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
desiredLines.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `desiredLines` array would have its length set to 0, potentially causing the `desiredLines.push` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
desiredLines = getFileNameAndLineNumber(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `desiredLines` array would be replaced with an array containing the file name and line number of the current stack line, rather than the line itself.

DONE.
