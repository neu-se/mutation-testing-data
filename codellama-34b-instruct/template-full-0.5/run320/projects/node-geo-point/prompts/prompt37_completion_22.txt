  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from `point2Rad` would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the `acos` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of `point2Rad` by 2 would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the `acos` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the division of `point2Rad` by 2 would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the `acos` function to return a different value.

DONE.
