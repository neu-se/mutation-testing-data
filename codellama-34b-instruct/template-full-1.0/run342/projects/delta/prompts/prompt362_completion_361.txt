  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to skip over any inserted characters, which would change the outcome of the transform function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to exit as soon as it encounters a zero-length op, which would not allow it to process the entire delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to skip over any inserted characters in the other delta, which would change the outcome of the transform function.

DONE.
