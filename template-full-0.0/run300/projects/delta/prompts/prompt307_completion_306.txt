  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current operation, rather than the length of the current line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current operation, rather than the length of the current line, and would also add 1 to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current operation, rather than the length of the current line, and would also subtract 1 from the result.

DONE.
