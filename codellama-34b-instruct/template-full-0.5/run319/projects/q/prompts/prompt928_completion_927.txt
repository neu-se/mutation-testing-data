  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would refer to the first argument passed to the function, whereas `arguments` would refer to the entire arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[arguments.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[arguments.length - 1]` would refer to the last argument passed to the function, whereas `arguments` would refer to the entire arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice(1)` would refer to the arguments object starting from the second argument, whereas `arguments` would refer to the entire arguments object.

DONE.
