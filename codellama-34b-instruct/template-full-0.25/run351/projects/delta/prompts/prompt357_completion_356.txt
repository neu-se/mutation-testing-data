  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `arg` as-is, while the modified code fragment is incrementing the value of `arg` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `arg` as-is, while the modified code fragment is decrementing the value of `arg` by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the value of `arg` as-is, while the modified code fragment is multiplying the value of `arg` by 2.

DONE.
