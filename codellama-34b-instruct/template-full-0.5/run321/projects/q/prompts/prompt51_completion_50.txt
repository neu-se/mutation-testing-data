  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `requestTick` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `requestTick` function to be called later, but with a delay of 0 milliseconds, which would be essentially immediate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(requestTick)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `requestTick` function to be called later, but with a delay of 0 milliseconds, which would be essentially immediate, and also it would use the `setImmediate` function which is a non-standard function that is not supported in all browsers.

DONE.
