  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not have the same behavior as the original `definition` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would not have the same behavior as the original `definition` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the number `42` would not have the same behavior as the original `definition` function.

DONE.
