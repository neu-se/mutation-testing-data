  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference in the number of parts is exactly 1, while this new code fragment checks if the difference is exactly 2. If the link URL has more than two parts beyond the page URL, this new code fragment would result in a different classification of the link, such as "sublevel" or "internal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference in the number of parts is exactly 1, while this new code fragment checks if the difference is less than 0. If the link URL has fewer parts than the page URL, this new code fragment would result in a different classification of the link, such as "uplevel" or "external".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in
