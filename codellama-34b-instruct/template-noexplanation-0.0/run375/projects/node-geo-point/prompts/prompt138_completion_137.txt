  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This change will cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a `GeoPoint` with the same longitude value as the original `GeoPoint`, regardless of the value of the `precision` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This change will cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a `GeoPoint` with a latitude value that is one degree higher than the original `GeoPoint`, regardless of the value of the `precision` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This change will cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a `GeoPoint` with a latitude value that is twice the original `GeoPoint`, regardless of the value of the `precision` parameter.

DONE.
