  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y)` is a different promise than `Q(x)`, and the `join` method would be called on a different promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is `value` in this case. This means that the new promise would be resolved with the value of `x`, rather than being rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { throw new Error("error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is rejected with the error thrown by the callback function. This means that the new promise would be rejected with an error, rather than being resolved with the
