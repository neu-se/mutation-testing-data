  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will negate the truthy value of `cb`, causing the `else` branch to always be executed, regardless of whether `cb` has been called or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would modify the value of `cb`, causing the `else` branch to always be executed, regardless of whether `cb` has been called or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.call(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would call `cb` with a truthy value as its first argument, causing the `else` branch to always be executed, regardless of whether `cb` has been called or not.

DONE.
