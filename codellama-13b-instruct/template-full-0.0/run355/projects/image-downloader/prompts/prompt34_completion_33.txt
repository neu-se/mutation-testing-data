  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the response data to be consumed and freed up memory. This could potentially cause the `resume()` method to be called multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called with a `null` argument, which would cause the response data to be consumed and freed up memory. This could potentially cause the `resume()` method to be called multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resume()` method is called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause the response data to be consumed and freed up memory. This could potentially cause the `
