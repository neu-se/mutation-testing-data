  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop()` would remove the last element of the `ref` array, while `ref.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.push(null)` would add a `null` element to the end of the `ref` array, while `ref.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift()` would remove the first element of the `ref` array, while `ref.unshift()` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
