Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { someAttribute: true }, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the attributes object passed to the predicate, potentially altering the logic that depends on the attributes of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the index `i` by 1, which may affect the processing of subsequent lines and how they are indexed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` instead of an empty object for the attributes, which could lead to different handling in the predicate function if it expects an object.

DONE.
