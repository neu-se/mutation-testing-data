  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key2
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is a variable that represents the current key in the data structure, while `key2` is a different variable that may not exist in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"key"` is a string literal rather than a variable, and it may not be recognized as a valid key in the data structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which may not be a valid key in the data structure.

DONE.
