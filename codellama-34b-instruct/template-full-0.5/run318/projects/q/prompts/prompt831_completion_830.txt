  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled, which would cause the `then` method to be skipped and the `catch` method to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with a value of `null` instead of `fulfilled`, which would cause the `then` method to be called with `null` as the argument instead of `fulfilled`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with a value of `undefined` instead of `fulfilled`, which would cause the `then` method to be called with `undefined` as the argument instead of `fulfilled`.

DONE.
