  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a boolean value indicating whether the operation is a delete operation or not. If we replace `op.retain` with `op.delete`, the `retain` method will be called on a boolean value, which will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is an object that contains the text to be inserted, and the `retain` method expects an object with a `length` property. If we replace `op.retain` with `op.insert`, the `retain` method will be called on an object with no `length` property, which will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length` is a method that returns the length of the insert operation, and the `retain
