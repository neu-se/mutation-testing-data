  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () {
    return promise;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` function now always returns a resolved promise, rather than a value or a promise. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to resolve the promise prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () {
    return reject;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` function now always returns a rejected promise, rather than a value or a promise. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` function to reject the promise prematurely, leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function () {
    throw new Error("Not Implemented");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `des
