  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is a string. If `op.retain` is a string, the original code would return 1, while this code would return the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is not undefined. If `op.retain` is not undefined, the original code would return the length of the string, while this code would return 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while this code checks if it is not null. If `op.ret
