  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is a string, instead of the `currentUrl` argument, which is an object. This would cause the function to return a different parsed URL object, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` function would be called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is a string, and the `search` argument set to `false`, instead of the `currentUrl` argument, which is an object, and the `search` argument set to `true`. This would cause the function to return a different parsed URL object, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.
