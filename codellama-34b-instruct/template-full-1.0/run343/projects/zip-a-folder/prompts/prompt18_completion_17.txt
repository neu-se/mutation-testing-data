  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK` would check if the file is both readable and writable, whereas `fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK` would check if the file is either readable or writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK && fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.R_OK && fs.constants.W_OK` would check if both `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK` are truthy, whereas `fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK` would check if either one is truthy.
