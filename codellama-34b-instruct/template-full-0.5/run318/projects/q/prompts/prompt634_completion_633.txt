  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` method delays the execution of the promise for 1000 milliseconds, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called after a delay, potentially resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("PLACEHOLDER"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method rejects the promise with the given error, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a rejected promise, potentially resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` method resolves the promise with the given value, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a resolved promise, potentially resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
