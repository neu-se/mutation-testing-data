  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last character of the word and append "ies" to the end, while the buggy code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the last character of the word with "ies". This would result in different plural forms for words that end in "y" and "quy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/y$/, 'ies') }
```
