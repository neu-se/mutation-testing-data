  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        -Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the `Math.sin(b)` term is flipped, which would cause the `tanh` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is used instead of `Math.sin`, which would cause the `tanh` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is used instead of `Math.sin`, which would cause the `tanh`
