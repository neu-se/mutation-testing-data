  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a different way of calculating the real component of the complex number, and it would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a different way of calculating the real component of the complex number, and it would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a different way of calculating the real component of the complex number, and it would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
