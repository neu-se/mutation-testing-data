  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1,2,3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to iterate over the first element of the array, which is a number, instead of over the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to iterate over an empty array, instead of over the array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[,,]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to iterate over an array of two undefined values, instead of over the array of arguments.

DONE.
