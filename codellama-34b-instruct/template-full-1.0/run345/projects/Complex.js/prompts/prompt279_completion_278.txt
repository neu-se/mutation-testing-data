  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a given angle in radians, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine. Changing the function will cause the code to calculate the incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `Math.cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a given angle in radians. Changing the function to a constant will cause the code to calculate the incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a mathematical expression that returns the sum of two numbers, while `Math.cos` is a function that returns the cosine of a given angle in radians. Changing the function to an expression will
