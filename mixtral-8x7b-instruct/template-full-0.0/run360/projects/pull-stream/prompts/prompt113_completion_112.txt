 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the error (if any) to the callback, while this modification also passes the accumulator value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not terminate the process, while this modification immediately terminates the process with a non-zero exit code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error to the callback, while this modification logs the error to the console and continues execution.

DONE.
