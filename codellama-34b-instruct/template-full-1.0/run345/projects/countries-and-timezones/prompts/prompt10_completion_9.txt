  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `result[country]` is null, but it would not check if it's undefined. If `result[country]` is undefined, the code would still crash because it would try to access the `current` property of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(result).includes(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `country` is a key in the `result` object, but it would not check if it's a property of the `result` object. If `country` is not a key in the `result` object, the code would still crash because it would try to access the `current` property of undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof result[country] === 'undefined'
```
