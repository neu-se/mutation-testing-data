  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment has a different string value, which would cause the pluralization function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment uses string concatenation to add the 's' suffix, which would cause the pluralization function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment uses the '+' operator to concatenate a string and a number, which would cause the pluralization function to return a different result.

DONE.
