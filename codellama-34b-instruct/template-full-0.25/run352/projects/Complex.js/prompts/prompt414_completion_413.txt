  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the positive square root, while the new code fragment calculates the negative square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the positive square root, while the new code fragment calculates the negative square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the positive square root, while the new code fragment calculates the square root of a different value.

DONE.
