  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to instead of overwritten.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten instead of appended to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'wx' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'wx'`, which means that the file will be created if it does not exist, and the operation will fail if the file already exists.

DONE.
