  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `_read`, so if `_read` is truthy, it would become falsy, and if `_read` is falsy, it would become truthy. This would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called when it should not be, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `_read`, which would cause the `nextChunk()` function to be called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
