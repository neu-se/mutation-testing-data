 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw a string instead of an Error object, which could cause issues in error handling downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an empty object instead of an Error object, which could cause issues in error handling downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Another error')
