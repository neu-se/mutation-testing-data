  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.forEach(predicate)
```
This would result in an infinite loop because it would repeatedly call the `predicate` function with the same `op` and `index` arguments, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(predicate)
```
This would result in an infinite loop because it would repeatedly call the `predicate` function with the same `op` and `index` arguments, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(predicate)
```
This would result in an infinite loop because it would repeatedly call the `predicate` function with the same `op` and `index` arguments, causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
