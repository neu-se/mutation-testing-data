  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and would cause the `Q.isPromise` function to return `false`, which would change the flow of execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and would cause the `Q.isPromise` function to return `false`, which would change the flow of execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () { return true; }, function () { return false; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise, and the resulting value would be different from the original value.

DONE.
