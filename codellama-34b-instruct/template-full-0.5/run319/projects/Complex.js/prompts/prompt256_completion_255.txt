  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different output values for the same input arguments, which would cause the final result of the `expm1` function to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` have different output values for the same input arguments, which would cause the final result of the `expm1` function to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` and `Math.sin` have different output values for the same input arguments, which would cause the final result of the `expm1` function to be different.

DONE.
