  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator is applied to the `a` variable, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is incremented by 1, which would change the value of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is multiplied by 2, which would change the value of the expression.

DONE.
