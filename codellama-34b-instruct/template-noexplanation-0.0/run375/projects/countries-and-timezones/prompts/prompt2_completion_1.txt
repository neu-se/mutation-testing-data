  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This code fragment is a function call that passes the `data.timezones` object as an argument to the `getTimezonesMap` function. This function call is equivalent to the original code fragment, which was `getTimezonesMap(data)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This code fragment is a function call that passes the `data.timezones` object as an argument to the `buildTimezonesMap` function. This function call is equivalent to the original code fragment, which was `buildTimezonesMap(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).reduce((result, id) => {
  const tz = data.timezones[id];
  const { c, a } = tz;
  const aliasTz = data.
