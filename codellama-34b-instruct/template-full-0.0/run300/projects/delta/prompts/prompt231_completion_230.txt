  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is larger than the actual length of the `other` Delta, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is smaller than the actual length of the `other` Delta, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a value that is larger than the actual length of the `other` Delta, potentially leading to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
