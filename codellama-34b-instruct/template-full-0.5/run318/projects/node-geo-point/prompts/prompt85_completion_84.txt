  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the destination point, whereas `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point. Using `φ2` instead of `φ1` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the destination point's latitude, rather than the starting point's latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` is the cosine of the starting point's latitude, whereas `φ1` is the starting point's latitude itself. Using `cos(φ1)` instead of `φ1` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the cosine of the starting point's latitude, rather than the starting point's latitude itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(φ1
