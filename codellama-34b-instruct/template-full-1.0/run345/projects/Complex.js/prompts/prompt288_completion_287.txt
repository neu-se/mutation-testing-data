  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with buggy code fragments that would cause different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the division would introduce a different factor of 0.5, which would affect the calculation of the tangent. The original code calculates the tangent using only the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, without modifying them. By dividing by 2, we would be modifying the values of the real and imaginary parts, which would result in a different tangent calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition would introduce a new term that would affect the calculation of the tangent. The original code calculates the tangent using only the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, without adding any additional terms. By adding `a + b`, we would be introducing a new term that would change the calculation of the tangent.

Option 3:
