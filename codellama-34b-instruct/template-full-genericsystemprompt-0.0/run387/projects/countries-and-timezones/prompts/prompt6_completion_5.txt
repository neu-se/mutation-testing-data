  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the given `id` instead of the `data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[a]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the given `a` instead of the `data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[c]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the given `c` instead of the `data` object.

DONE.
