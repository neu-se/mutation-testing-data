  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `stream`, which would cause the function to behave differently when `stream` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `stream` by 2, which would cause the function to behave differently when `stream` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `stream` array, which would cause the function to behave differently when `stream` is an array.

DONE.
