  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, policy.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a cloned policy object into the map rather than the original policy object, which could cause unexpected behavior if the policies are stateful or if the map is expected to insert the exact same object reference multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value into the map instead of the policy object, which could cause methods such as `get` and `query` to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, this.get(policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the policy object that is already in the map, rather than the current policy object from the `push` method, which could cause methods such as `push` and `query` to always return the same result, even if the policy object has been modified.
