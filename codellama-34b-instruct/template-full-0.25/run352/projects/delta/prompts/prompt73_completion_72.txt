  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the beginning of the array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp, this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

DONE.
