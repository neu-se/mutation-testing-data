  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `if` statement, causing the code inside the `if` block to run even if `hasStacks` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks && typeof process === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional condition to the `if` statement, causing the code inside the `if` block to only run if `hasStacks` is `false` and `process` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `if` statement, causing the code inside the `if` block to run even if `hasStacks` is `true`.

DONE.
