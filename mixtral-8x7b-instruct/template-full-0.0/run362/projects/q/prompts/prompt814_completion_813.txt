 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is called immediately, not when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` is not invoked as a function, resulting in no action being taken when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used with an empty array, which would cause the `callback` to be called without any arguments. If the `callback` expects an argument (such as an error object), this would cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
