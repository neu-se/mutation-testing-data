  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause unintended consequences if the error handling code is not properly implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would not be rejected at all, which could lead to unexpected results if the error handling code is depends on the promise being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('intentional error')
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown, which would be caught by the promise and cause it to be rejected, but the error message would be different from the original error message, which could cause confusion if the error handling code is not properly implemented.

DONE.
