Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${source} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `cssMapping.sourceRoot` from the source URL, potentially leading to incorrect source mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${cssMapping.sources[0]}${source} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first source in the `cssMapping.sources` array instead of the original source, potentially causing incorrect source mapping.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${source.toUpperCase()} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the source URL to uppercase, potentially causing issues with case-sensitive source mapping.

DONE.
