  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would strip the BOM character from the beginning of the string, even if it's not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^(\uFEFF|\uFEFF\uFEFF)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would strip the BOM character and any subsequent BOM characters from the beginning of the string, even if they're not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would strip all BOM characters from the beginning of the string, even if they're not present.

DONE.
