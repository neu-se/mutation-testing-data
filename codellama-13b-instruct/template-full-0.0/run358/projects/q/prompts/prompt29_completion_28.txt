  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length` property is used to determine whether the `laterQueue` array is empty or not, and the `+ 1` operation would cause the `laterQueue.length` property to be incremented by 1, which would cause the `while` loop to execute an extra iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length` property is used to determine whether the `laterQueue` array is empty or not, and the `- 1` operation would cause the `laterQueue.length` property to be decremented by 1, which would cause the `while` loop to execute one less iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `l
