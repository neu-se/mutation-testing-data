  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches a backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches the start of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a forward slash, while the new code fragment matches the end of a string.

DONE.
