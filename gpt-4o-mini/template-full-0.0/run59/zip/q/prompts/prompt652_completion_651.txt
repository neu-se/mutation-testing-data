Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the arguments array to 0, which means it will include all arguments instead of starting from the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments array with an empty array, meaning no arguments will be passed to the invoked method, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the method requires arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the arguments array to 1, which means it will skip the first argument and only include the rest, altering the intended invocation of the method.

DONE.
