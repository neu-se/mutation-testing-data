  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `gettype` function would be the same as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl, baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `gettype` function would be the same as the first argument, which would cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `gettype` function would be the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, which would cause the function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
