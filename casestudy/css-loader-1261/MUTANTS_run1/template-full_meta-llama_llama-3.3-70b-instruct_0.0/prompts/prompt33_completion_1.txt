Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of the original `normalizedUrl`, which would change the encoding of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL is converted to uppercase, which could affect the decoding process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(normalizedUrl + "?")
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra query parameter is added to the URL, and the `unescape` function is applied to the resulting string, which could lead to incorrect decoding.

DONE.
