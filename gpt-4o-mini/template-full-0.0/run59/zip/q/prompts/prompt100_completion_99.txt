Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the array, which would incorrectly skip over valid elements in a sparse array, potentially leading to an `undefined` value being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current element is `undefined`, which would cause the function to skip over valid elements that are not `undefined`, thus altering the intended reduction logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the index exists in the `arguments` object instead of the array, which would always return false for a normal array, leading to the reduction process failing to iterate over the array elements correctly.

DONE.
