  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is computing the square of `a` and the square of `b`, while the replaced code fragment is computing the product of `a` and `b` twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is computing the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while the replaced code fragment is computing the difference of the squares of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is computing the product of `a` and `b`, while the replaced code fragment is computing the difference of `a` and `b` multiplied by `b`.

DONE.
