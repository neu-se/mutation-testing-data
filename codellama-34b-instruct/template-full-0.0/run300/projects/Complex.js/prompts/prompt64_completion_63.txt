  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a different property of the `a` object than `phi`.

DONE.
