  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called with the rejection reason as an argument, whereas the original code fragment would not pass any arguments to the `onRejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called without any arguments, whereas the original code fragment would pass the rejection reason as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected(err, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function would be called with two arguments, the rejection reason and the index of the rejected promise, whereas the original code fragment would pass only the rejection reason as an argument.

DONE.
