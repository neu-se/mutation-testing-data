  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the index to be incremented by 1, potentially resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the index to be decremented by 1, potentially resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the index to be multiplied by 2, potentially resulting in a different value being returned.

DONE.
