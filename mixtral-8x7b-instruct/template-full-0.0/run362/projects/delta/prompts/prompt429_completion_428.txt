 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would return true for some cases where the original code would return false, potentially causing the iterator to continue iterating past the end of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would always return false, causing the iterator to stop iterating immediately, even if there are more elements in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method would not take into account the `offset` property, potentially causing the iterator to continue iterating past the end of the `ops` array or stop iterating prematurely.

DONE.
