  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the test for all values of `data`, instead of only passing the test for `data` that satisfies the regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fail the test for all values of `data`, instead of only failing the test for `data` that satisfies the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the test for all values of `data` that match the regex after being converted to lowercase, instead of only passing the test for `data` that satisfies the regex in its original form.

DONE.
