  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to delete the wrong characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain the wrong characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to insert the wrong characters.

DONE.
