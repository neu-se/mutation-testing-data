  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null value for `data`, but `null` would cause the `op` function to be called with `null` as an argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a defined value for `data`, but `undefined` would cause the `op` function to be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value for `data`, but `0` would cause the `op` function to be called with `0` as an argument, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
