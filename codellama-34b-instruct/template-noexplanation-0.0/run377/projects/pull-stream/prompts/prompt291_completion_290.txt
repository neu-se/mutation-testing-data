  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `false`, regardless of the input. This will likely cause tests that rely on the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `null`, regardless of the input. This will likely cause tests that rely on the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input. This will likely cause tests that rely on the function to fail.

DONE.
