  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with zero, while this replacement checks for greater than zero. This could cause the function to return a different value when the argument is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with zero, while this replacement checks for inequality with the other variable. This could cause the function to return a different value when the arguments are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with zero, while this replacement checks for equality with zero using the absolute value of the variable. This could cause the function to return a different value when the argument is negative.

DONE.
