  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that handles the rejection of a promise, while `onFulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of a promise. Replacing `onFulfilled` with `onRejected` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled, which could have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a function that handles the progress of a promise, while `onFulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of a promise. Replacing `onFulfilled` with `onProgress` would cause the promise to be in a progress state instead of a fulfilled state, which could have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in
