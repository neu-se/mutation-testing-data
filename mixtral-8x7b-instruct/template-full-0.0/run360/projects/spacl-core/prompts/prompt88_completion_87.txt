 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra value (the policy object itself) to the Map, causing issues when trying to retrieve policies by name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name.toUpperCase(), policy]
