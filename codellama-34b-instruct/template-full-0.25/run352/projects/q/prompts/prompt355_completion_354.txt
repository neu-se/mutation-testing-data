  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the `newException` object would be returned, which may not be the same as the original `newException` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `newException` object would be returned, which may not be the same as the original `newException` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of the `newException` object would be returned, which may not be the same as the original `newException` object.

DONE.
