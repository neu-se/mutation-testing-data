  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment is not the same as the one used in the buggy code fragment. The original code fragment uses the regular expression `/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/` to match wildcards in the path specification, while the buggy code fragment uses the regular expression `/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/` to match wildcards in the path specification. These regular expressions are not equivalent, and the buggy code fragment may not match all valid wildcards in the path specification.
