  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the variable `a` would cause the `toString()` method to return a string representation of the complex number with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the variable `a` would cause the `toString()` method to return a string representation of the complex number with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the variable `a` would cause the `toString()` method to return a string representation of the complex number with a different value.

DONE.
