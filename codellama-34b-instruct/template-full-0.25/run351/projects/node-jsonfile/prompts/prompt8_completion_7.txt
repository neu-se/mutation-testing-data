  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data, while this code uses a regular expression to remove the BOM. The regular expression may not match the BOM in all cases, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^(\ufeff)+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in this code fragment matches one or more BOMs at the beginning of the data, while the original code only matches a single BOM. This could lead to different behavior if the data contains multiple BOMs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^(\ufeff)+/g, '').replace(/^(\ufeff)+/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular
