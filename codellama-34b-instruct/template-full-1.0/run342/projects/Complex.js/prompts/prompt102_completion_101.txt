  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(plus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the plus sign instead of minus.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a different modulo 3 instead of modulo 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(plus % 2 ? '-' : '') + d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different variable than c.

DONE.
