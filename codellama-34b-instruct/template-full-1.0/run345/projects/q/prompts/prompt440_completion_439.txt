  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the reasons for unhandled rejections instead of the rejections themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, "no stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat all rejections as unhandled, regardless of whether they were handled or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the rejections that have been reported as unhandled, instead of all unhandled rejections.

DONE.
