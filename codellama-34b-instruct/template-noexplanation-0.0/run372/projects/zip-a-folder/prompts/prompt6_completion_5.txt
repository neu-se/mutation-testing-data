  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This will cause the `targetBasePath` variable to be set to the base name of the `targetFilePath` instead of the directory name, which will likely cause the `access` call to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This will cause the `targetBasePath` variable to be set to the extension of the `targetFilePath` instead of the directory name, which will likely cause the `access` call to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(path.dirname(targetFilePath), '..')
```
This will cause the `targetBasePath` variable to be set to the parent directory of the `targetFilePath` instead of the directory name, which will likely cause the `access` call to fail.

DONE.
