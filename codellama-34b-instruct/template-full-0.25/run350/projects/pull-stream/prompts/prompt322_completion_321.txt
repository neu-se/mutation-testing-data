  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(a && onEnd) || !onEnd`, which is not the same as the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `a || (onEnd && !onEnd)`, which is not the same as the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(!a && onEnd) || !onEnd`, which is not the same as the original expression.

DONE.
