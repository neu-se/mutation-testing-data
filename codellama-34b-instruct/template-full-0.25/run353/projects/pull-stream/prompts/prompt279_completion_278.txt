  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `prop`, which is a function. In the original code, `prop` is called as a function, but in the mutated code, it is used as a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is a property access expression, but `prop` is a function. In the original code, `prop` is called as a function, but in the mutated code, it is used as an object with a `foo` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop()` is a function call expression, but `prop` is a function. In the original code, `prop` is called as a function, but in the mutated code, it is used as a function that takes no arguments.
