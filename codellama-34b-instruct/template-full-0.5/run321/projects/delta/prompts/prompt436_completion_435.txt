  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `delete` property, while this code checks for the presence of
