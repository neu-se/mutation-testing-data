  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the `handler` is falsy, while this code checks for strict equality with `undefined`. If `handler` is `null`, the original code would return `true`, but this code would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `handler` is a function, while this code checks whether it is not a function. If `handler` is a function, the original code would return `false`, but this code would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `handler` is a function, while this code checks whether its constructor is not `Function`. If `handler` is a function, the original code would return `false`, but this code would return `true`.
