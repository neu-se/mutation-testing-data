  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the callback, while this new code fragment passes `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the callback, while this new code fragment passes a new error object instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the callback, while this new code fragment passes `undefined` instead.

DONE.
