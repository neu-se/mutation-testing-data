  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `length` variable is equal to 0, while the original code fragment checks if the `length` variable is falsy. If the `length` variable is equal to 0, the mutation code will return a different value than the original code fragment, which can cause a test failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `length` variable minus the `offset` variable is greater than 0, while the original code fragment checks if the `length` variable is less than or equal to `Infinity`. If the `length` variable is greater than `Infinity`, the mutation code will return a different value than the original code fragment, which can cause a test failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if
