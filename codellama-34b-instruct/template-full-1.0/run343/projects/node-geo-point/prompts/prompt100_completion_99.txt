  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the rad2deg function converts radians to degrees, and when replaced with 0, it would cause the function to always return 0, regardless of the input value, which is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the rad2deg function converts radians to degrees, and when replaced with 42, it would cause the function to always return 42 degrees, regardless of the input value, which is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the rad2deg function converts radians to degrees, and when replaced with the string 'hello', it would cause the function to always return the same value, regardless of the input value, which is not correct.

DONE.
