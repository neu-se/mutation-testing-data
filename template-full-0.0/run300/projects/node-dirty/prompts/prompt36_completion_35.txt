  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key];
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, undefined];
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is set to undefined, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, key];
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is set to the same as the key, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
