  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, regardless of the case of the letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, regardless of the presence or absence of newlines.

DONE.
