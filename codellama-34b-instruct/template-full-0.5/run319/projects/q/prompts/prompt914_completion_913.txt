  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `Object`, so it would not have an `arguments` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object literal, so it would not have an `arguments` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise` object, which is not an instance of `Object`, so it would not have an `arguments` property.

DONE.
