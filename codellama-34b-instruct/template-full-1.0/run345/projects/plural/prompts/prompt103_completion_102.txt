  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression would make it global, causing it to match all occurrences in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)s\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the "s" at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match only strings that end with "s", even if the regular expression is case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)s\b/gi
```
This would result in different behavior
