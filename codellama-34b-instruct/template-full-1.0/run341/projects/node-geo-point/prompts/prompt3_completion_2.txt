  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < 0 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both longitude values to be less than -180, while this new fragment only checks for one value to be less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude > -180 || longitude < 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both longitude values to be greater than 180, while this new fragment only checks for one value to be greater than -180.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < 0 && longitude > -180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses an OR operator, while this new fragment uses an AND operator.

DONE.
