  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "test" to the href attribute, which would cause the link to point to a different URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the "http://" protocol with "https://", which would cause the link to point to a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("?")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any query parameters from the URL, which could cause the link to point to a different resource.

DONE.
