Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore all additional arguments passed to the function, effectively only using the first argument (the method name) instead of all provided arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the total number of arguments instead of the actual arguments themselves, which would not be valid for the method invocation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the arguments, meaning that the method would be invoked without any parameters, potentially leading to unexpected results if the method requires arguments.

DONE.
