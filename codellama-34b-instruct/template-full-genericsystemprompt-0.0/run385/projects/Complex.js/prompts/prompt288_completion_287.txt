  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the complex number, while the mutated code fragment calculates the negative sine of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the complex number, while the mutated code fragment calculates the sine of the complex number plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the complex number, while the mutated code fragment calculates the sine of the complex number multiplied by the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
