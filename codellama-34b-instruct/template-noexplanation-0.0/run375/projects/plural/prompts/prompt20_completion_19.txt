  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the behavior of the function by adding an extra 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the behavior of the function by adding an extra 'es' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the behavior of the function by adding an extra 'ies' to the end of the word.

DONE.
