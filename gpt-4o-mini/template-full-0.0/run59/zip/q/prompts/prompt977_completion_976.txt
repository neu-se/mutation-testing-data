Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of creating a new deferred object that can resolve or reject, it immediately resolves the promise, which means that the callback will not be called in a Node-style manner.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to resolve the deferred object immediately, which would bypass the intended asynchronous behavior of waiting for the Node-style callback to be invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise, which would cause any subsequent `.then()` handlers to be skipped, leading to unhandled promise rejections instead of allowing the callback to execute.

DONE.
