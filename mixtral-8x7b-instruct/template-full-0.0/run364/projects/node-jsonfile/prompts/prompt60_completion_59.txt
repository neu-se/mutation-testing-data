 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an instance of `Buffer`, instead of checking if `content` is a `Buffer` object. This might not catch cases where `content` is a `Buffer` but not an instance of `Buffer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `content` is an array, instead of checking if `content` is a `Buffer`. This might not trigger any test failures, indicating that the tests do not cover the case where `stringify` is called with a `Buffer` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content && Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an unnecessary check for truthiness of `content`, which might not be present in the original code. This could lead to unexpected behavior in cases where `content` is falsy
