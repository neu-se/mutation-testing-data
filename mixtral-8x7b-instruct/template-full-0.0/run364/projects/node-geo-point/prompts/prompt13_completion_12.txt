 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `coordinates` array has 2 elements, but does not check if `point.coordinates` is an array. This could lead to a TypeError in the original code not being thrown when it should be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the correct operator to check if `point.coordinates` is an array, but it still does not check if the elements are of the correct type. This could lead to incorrect values being passed to `fromLngLatArray` and cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.every(item => typeof item === 'number') && point.coordinates.length !==
