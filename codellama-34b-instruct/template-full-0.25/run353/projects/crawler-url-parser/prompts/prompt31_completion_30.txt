  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches only if the string does not start with a protocol (e.g. "http://") or a single slash ("/"), while the modified code fragment matches only if the string does not start with a protocol or a single slash, or if it starts with a single slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)|^\w+:/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches only if the string does not start with a protocol (e.g. "http://") or a single slash ("/"), while the modified code fragment matches only if the string does not start with a protocol or a single slash, or if it starts with a word character followed by a colon (e.g. "http:").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?
