  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current object, not the `rules` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map((rule) => rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the same elements as `this.rules`, potentially changing the order of the elements or adding duplicate elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...this.rules]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the same elements as `this.rules`, preserving the order of the elements and not adding any duplicates.

DONE.
