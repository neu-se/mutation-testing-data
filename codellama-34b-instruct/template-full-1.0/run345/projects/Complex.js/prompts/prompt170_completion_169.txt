  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks for the presence of the "infinity" property on the object, which may not be the same as checking for the "zero" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property that refers to the object's constructor function, which may not have an `isInfinite` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.im === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, which may not be the same as checking for the presence of the "infinity" property.

DONE.
