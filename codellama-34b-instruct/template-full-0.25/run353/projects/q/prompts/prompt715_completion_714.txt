  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.foo` is not a valid property of the `object` variable, and would throw a `TypeError` if accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[bar]
```
This would result in different behavior because `bar` is not a defined variable, and would throw a `ReferenceError` if accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.baz` is not a valid property of the `object` variable, and would throw a `TypeError` if accessed.

DONE.
