  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` part would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `define` function to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& true` part would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `define` function to always be called, even if it was not intended to be called in that particular context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && define
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& define` part would always evaluate to `define`, causing the `define` function to be called with a different argument than it was intended to be called with.

DONE.
