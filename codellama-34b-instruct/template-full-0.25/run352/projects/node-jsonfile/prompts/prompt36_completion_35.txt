  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `options` object is used to pass arguments to the `fs.writeFile` method, so replacing it with `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value. The `options` object is used to pass arguments to the `fs.writeFile` method, so replacing it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. The `options` object is used to pass arguments to the `fs.writeFile` method, so replacing it with an empty object would cause an error.
