 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at (.+) \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the space character before the opening parenthesis in the regular expression, which could cause it to fail to match the expected pattern if there is a space in the actual stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the optional colon and following digits from the regular expression, which could cause it to fail to match the expected pattern if there are additional characters after the line number in the actual stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/at .+ \(.+:(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a space character before the opening parenthesis in the first capturing
