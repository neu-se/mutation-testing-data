 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `emit` method in a function expression, which would prevent it from being immediately invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', null, 'wrong argument')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an extra, incorrect argument to the `emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.anotherEmitMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because it references a non-existent method, causing a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
