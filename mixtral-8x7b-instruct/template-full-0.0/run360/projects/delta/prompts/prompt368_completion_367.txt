 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `peekType` method, whereas the original code fragment checks if the method exists first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `peekType` method in the context of the current object (`this`), which might not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter['peekType']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `peekType` property as a string key, which would bypass any potential overrides or modifications to the `peekType` method.

DONE.
