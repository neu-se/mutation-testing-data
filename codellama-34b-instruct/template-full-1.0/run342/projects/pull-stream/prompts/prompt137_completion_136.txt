  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return one more element than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return twice as many elements as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return half as many elements as the original code.

DONE.
