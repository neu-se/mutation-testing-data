  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` method searches for a match anywhere in the string, whereas `match` method matches the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, whereas `match` method returns an array of all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` method returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value is present in the string, whereas `match` method returns an array of all matches.

DONE.
