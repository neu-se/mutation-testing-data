 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a negative number is being calculated, which would cause an error in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be multiplied by 2, which would change the value of the denominator and thus the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(2 * (r - a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of the result is being taken, which would make the result always positive, even if the original result is negative.

DONE.
