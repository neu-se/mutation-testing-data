  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would not pass the `args` array to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the `this` value bound to the first argument, and it would not call the function with the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, and it would not call the function with the `args` array.

DONE.
