  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with only one argument instead of two, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with three arguments instead of two, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with a random number of arguments instead of two, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
