  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function (results) {
    return results.filter(function (result) {
        return result.state === "fulfilled";
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the fulfilled promises, whereas the original code returns all settled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function (results) {
    return results.filter(function (result) {
        return result.state === "rejected";
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the rejected promises, whereas the original code returns all settled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function (results) {
    return results.filter(function (result) {
        return result.state === "pending";
    });
});
