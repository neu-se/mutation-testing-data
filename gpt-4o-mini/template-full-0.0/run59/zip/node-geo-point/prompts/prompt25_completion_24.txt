Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'lat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for a property named 'lat' instead of 'longitude', leading to a TypeError when the method is called with a valid object that contains a 'latitude' property but lacks a 'lat' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for a property named 'longitudeextra', which will never exist in a valid object, causing a TypeError when the method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now incorrectly check for the existence of a 'latitude' property instead of 'longitude', which would lead to a TypeError when the method is called with a valid object that contains a 'longitude' property but lacks a 'latitude' property.

DONE.
