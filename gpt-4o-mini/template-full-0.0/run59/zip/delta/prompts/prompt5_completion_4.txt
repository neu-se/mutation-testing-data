Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the block that reduces the attributes if `keepNull` is explicitly `true`, potentially leading to attributes being retained even when they are `null`, which is contrary to the original intent of ignoring `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull && keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because this condition will always evaluate to `false`, causing the block to never execute, which means that all attributes from `b` will be included regardless of their values, including `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull || true
```
This would result in different behavior because this condition will always evaluate to `true`, causing the block to always execute, which means that all attributes from `b` will be reduced, regardless of whether `keepNull` is `true` or `false`, thus ignoring the original logic.

DONE.
