  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a variable that is undefined in the given code, so the code would produce a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is not called with the given code, so the progress value would not be updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed()
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the given code, so the progress value would be updated.

DONE.
