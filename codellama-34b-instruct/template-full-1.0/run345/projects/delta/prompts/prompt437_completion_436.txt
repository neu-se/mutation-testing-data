  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + nextOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp.attributes` would be converted to a number, which would change the result of the conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes + 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because `0.5` would be added to `nextOp.attributes`, which would change the result of the conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo" + nextOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` would be concatenated with `nextOp.attributes`, which would change the result of the conditional statement.

DONE.
