  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both `a` and `b` and returns the value of `b`. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `a + b` would cause the function to return the sum of `a` and `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both `a` and `b` and returns the value of `b`. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `a * b` would cause the function to return the product of `a` and `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates both `a` and `b`
