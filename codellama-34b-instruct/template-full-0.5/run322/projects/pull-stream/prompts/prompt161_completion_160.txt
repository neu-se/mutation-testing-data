  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the wrong arguments, potentially causing the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the second argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment that uses the `_value` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a modified version of the `_value` variable, potentially causing the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
