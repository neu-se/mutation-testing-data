  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getTimezone(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { allTimezones: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object with the `allTimezones` property set to `true`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
