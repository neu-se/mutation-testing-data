  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This code fragment will clear the entire data object, which is different from the original code fragment that only deletes the value associated with the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This code fragment will set the value associated with the given key to `undefined`, which is different from the original code fragment that deletes the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This code fragment will delete the key-value pair from the data object, which is the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
