 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only filters operations with an `insert` property, instead of using the provided predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(() => true)
