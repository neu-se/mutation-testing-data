 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.ops.slice(thisIter.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `ops` array directly and uses `slice` instead of the `rest` method, which could lead to different behavior if the `OpIterator` has any additional logic in its `rest` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.ops.splice(thisIter.index + 1)
