  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__proto__
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the prototype object of the `Q` function, rather than the `Q` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the prototype object of the `Q` function's constructor, rather than the `Q` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `Promise` constructor function, rather than the `Q` function itself.

DONE.
