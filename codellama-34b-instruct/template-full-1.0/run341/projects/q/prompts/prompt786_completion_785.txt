  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected with `rejected` if it is not fulfilled before the timeout. However, in the modified code, the promise is rejected with `1` instead of `rejected`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void rejected, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected with `rejected` if it is not fulfilled before the timeout. However, in the modified code, the promise is rejected with `1` instead of `rejected`. Additionally, the order of the arguments is swapped, so the rejection reason comes before the timeout value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, reject(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected with `rejected` if it is not fulfilled before the timeout.
