  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w => w
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of applying the rule to the word, while this modified code fragment returns the unmodified word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of applying the rule to the word, while this modified code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the result of applying the rule to the word, while this modified code fragment returns `null`.

DONE.
