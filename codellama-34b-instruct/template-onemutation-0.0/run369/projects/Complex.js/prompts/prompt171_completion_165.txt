  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is zero or `z` is infinite, but the replaced code fragment checks if `this` is zero or `z` is zero.

DONE.
