  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass both the error and the value to the nodeback function, whereas the original code only passed the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value to the nodeback function, whereas the original code passed the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the error and null to the nodeback function, whereas the original code only passed the error.

DONE.
