  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` can be `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `options.dest` is not actually required.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest.length` can be `0`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `options.dest` is not actually required.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.indexOf(' ') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` can contain a space, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `options.dest` is not actually required.

DONE.
