 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the URL starts with 'http' and ignores other possible protocols like 'https'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^[a-z0-9]+:/.test(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the URL starts with an alphanumeric character followed by a colon, which would match 'ftp:' or 'mailto:' schemes, but not relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!currentUrlStr.startsWith('//')
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the URL does not start with '//', which would allow relative URLs to be used as base URLs, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
