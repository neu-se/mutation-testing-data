  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is a string, while `baseOp.attributes` is an object. Using `baseOp.insert` would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive a string as input, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.retain` is a number, while `baseOp.attributes` is an object. Using `baseOp.retain` would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive a number as input, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.delete` is a boolean, while `baseOp.attributes` is an object. Using `baseOp.delete` would cause the `AttributeMap.invert`
