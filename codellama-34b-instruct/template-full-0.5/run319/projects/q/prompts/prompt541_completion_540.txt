  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is an expression that evaluates to the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is an expression that evaluates to the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"undefined"` is a string, whereas `void 0` is an expression that evaluates to the value `undefined`.

DONE.
