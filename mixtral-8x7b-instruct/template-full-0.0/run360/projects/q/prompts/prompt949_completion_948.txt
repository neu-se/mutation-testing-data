 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` method uses the provided `this` value, while `apply` uses the provided array as `this` and arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value and arguments provided, but does not execute the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` executes the provided code as JavaScript, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.

DONE.
