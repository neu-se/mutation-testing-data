  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the map, whereas `values()` returns an iterator over the values of the map. In the context of the code, `values()` is used to iterate over the URLs in the map and extract the type of each URL. If `keys()` is used instead, the code would iterate over the keys (which are the URLs) and try to extract the type of each key, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the map, whereas `values()` returns an iterator over the values of the map. In the context of the code, `values()` is used to iterate over the URLs in the map and extract the type of each URL. If `entries()` is used instead, the code would iterate over the key-value pairs and try to extract the type of each key-value pair
