  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs` is a property of the `Rule` class, while `verb` is a parameter of the `allow` and `deny` methods. Using `verbs` instead of `verb` would cause the code to modify the `verbs` property instead of the `verb` parameter, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs: { [index: string]: boolean } = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same properties as the `verbs` object, but with different values. This would cause the code to modify the new object instead of the original `verbs` object, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verbs = { ...this.verbs }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same properties and values as
