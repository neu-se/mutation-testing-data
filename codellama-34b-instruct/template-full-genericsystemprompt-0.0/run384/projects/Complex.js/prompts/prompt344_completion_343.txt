  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the `b * 2` expression, which is twice the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses the `a + b` expression, which is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
