  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sqrt` have different ranges and domains. While `Math.sqrt` returns the non-negative square root of a number, `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.sqrt` have different ranges and domains. While `Math.sqrt` returns the non-negative square root of a number, `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sqrt` have different ranges and domains. While `Math.sqrt` returns the non-negative square root of a number, `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number.

DONE.
