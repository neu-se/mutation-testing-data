  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite()` checks if the number is infinite. If the number is NaN, it will return true for `isNaN()` but false for `isInfinite()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` checks if the number is a finite number, while `isInfinite()` checks if the number is infinite. If the number is finite, it will return true for `isFinite()` but false for `isInfinite()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `isInfinite()`. If the number is infinite, it will return false for `isInfinite()` and true for `!isInfinite()`.
