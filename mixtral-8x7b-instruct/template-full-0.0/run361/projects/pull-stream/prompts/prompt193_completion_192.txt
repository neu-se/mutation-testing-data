 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if(true)` condition will always be met, causing the function to immediately return `cb(aborted)` without checking if `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `if(null)` will always be falsy, and the code inside the `if` block will not execute, potentially causing unexpected behavior if the `abort` callback is not called elsewhere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `read` function is truthy, which is likely not the intended behavior. This could cause the function to behave unexpectedly if the `read` function is defined but has a falsy value.

DONE.
