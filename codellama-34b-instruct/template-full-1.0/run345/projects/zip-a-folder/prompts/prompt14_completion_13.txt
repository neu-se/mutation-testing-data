  option 1

```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
this would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W_OK` would allow the user to write to the file, while `fs.constants.R_OK` would only allow the user to read from the file.

option 2

```
process.env.R_OK
```
this would result in different behavior because `process.env.R_OK` would look for an environment variable named "R_OK" whiles `fs.constants.R_OK` would look for a constant value defined by the fs module.

option 3

```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
this would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.X_OK` would check for execution permission while `fs.constants.R_OK` would check for read permission.
