  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns the type of a value as a string, while `type` calls the `type` function and returns a string representing the object's type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only perform the regular expression test on the `word` variable and not on the `rule[0]` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only perform the regular expression test on the `word` variable and not on the `rule[1]` variable.

DONE.
