  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if there are any reported unhandled rejections, regardless of whether the current promise is in the list of reported unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the current promise is in the list of reported unhandled rejections, regardless of whether there are any reported unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if there are any reported unhandled rejections, regardless of whether the current promise is in the list of reported unhandled rejections.

DONE.
