  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] < 0 && a['phi'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['r']` is not finite and `a['phi']` is finite, while this code fragment checks if `a['r']` is less than 0 and `a['phi']` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] > 0 && a['phi'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a['r']` is not finite and `a['phi']` is finite, while this code fragment checks if `a['r']` is greater than 0 and `a['phi']` is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] === 0 && a['phi'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
