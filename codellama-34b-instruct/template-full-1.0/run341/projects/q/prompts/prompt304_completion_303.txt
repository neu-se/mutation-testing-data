  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate infinitely if the condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate infinitely if the condition is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once even if the length of the array is greater than 1.

DONE.
