 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'mouses' for singular nouns ending in 'o', while this change would return 'mouses' which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return w + 'x' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function passed to `addRule` is not being used, and the returned value would always append 'x' to the input word, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns 'mouse' for singular nouns ending in 'o' when the word is 'moose', while this change would return 'mooses' which is incorrect.

DONE.
