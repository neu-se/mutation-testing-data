  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, while `null` would be used as the `this` value for the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, while `undefined` would be used as the `this` value for the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the `apply` method, while `this` would be used as the `this` value for the `apply` method.

DONE.
