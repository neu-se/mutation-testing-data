  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the fulfillment callback to be called with the rejection reason, and the rejection callback to be called with the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(fulfilled, rejected) => {
    return rejected(fulfilled);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment and rejection callbacks are swapped, causing the rejection callback to be called with the fulfillment value, and the fulfillment callback to be called with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(fulfilled, rejected) => {
    return fulfilled(rejected);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfillment callback is called with the rejection reason, causing the promise to be rejected with the rejection reason, even if the original promise was fulfilled.
