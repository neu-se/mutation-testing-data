 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'0' as any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the embedType to be a string, which could cause issues if the handler is expecting a number or another type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'embedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string 'embedType' as the embedType, instead of getting the actual embed type from the op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(a as any)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the type checking of the 'a' variable, potentially causing issues if 'a' is not an object or does not have a property at index 0.

DONE.
