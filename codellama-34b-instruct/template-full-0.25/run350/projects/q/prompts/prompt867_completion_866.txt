  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` to resolve the promise, while this new code fragment uses `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` to resolve the promise, while this new code fragment uses `deferred.notify(error)` to notify the promise of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.resolve(value)` to resolve the promise, while this new code fragment uses `deferred.reject(value)` to reject the promise with a value.

DONE.
