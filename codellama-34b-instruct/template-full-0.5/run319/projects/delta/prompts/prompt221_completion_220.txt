  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diffResult = diff(strings[0], strings[1], cursor);
```
This would result in different behavior because `diffResult` would be assigned the return value of the `diff` function, which is a `Delta` object, instead of the `diff` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diffResult = strings[0].diff(strings[1], cursor);
```
This would result in different behavior because `diffResult` would be assigned the return value of the `diff` method called on `strings[0]`, which is a `Delta` object, instead of the `diff` function itself.
