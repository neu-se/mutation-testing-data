  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `i` after the loop body has been executed, whereas the original code fragment increments `i` before the loop body is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `i` by 2 after the loop body has been executed, whereas the original code fragment increments `i` by 1 before the loop body is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `i` by 1 after the loop body has been executed, whereas the original code fragment increments `i` by 1 before the loop body is executed.

DONE.
