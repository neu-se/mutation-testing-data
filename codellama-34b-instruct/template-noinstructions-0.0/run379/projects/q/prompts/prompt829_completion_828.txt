  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, but the new code fragment throws an error regardless of the type of `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` is not a function, but the new code fragment throws an error regardless of the type of `callback`.
