  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because exclamation point `!` will return `true` if the value is "falsy," which means the promise is likely to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because a promise in the "rejected" state is likely to be rejected, whereas the original code only checks if the `state` property is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the `state` property is defined, whereas this code checks that the state is not "fulfilled."

DONE.
