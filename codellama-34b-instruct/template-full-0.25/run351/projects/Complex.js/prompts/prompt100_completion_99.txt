  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now 3 instead of 2, which would cause the sign to be incorrect for certain values of `minus` and `c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` is now increased by 1, which would cause the sign to be incorrect for certain values of `minus` and `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (c * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `c` is now multiplied by 2, which would cause the sign to be incorrect for certain values of `minus` and `c`.

DONE.
