  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different substring than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different substring than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different substring than the original code fragment.

DONE.
