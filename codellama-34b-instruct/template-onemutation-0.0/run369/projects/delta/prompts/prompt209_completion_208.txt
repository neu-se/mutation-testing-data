  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` operation onto the `delta` object, which would modify the `delta` object's state. In the original code, the `otherOp` operation is not pushed onto the `delta` object, so the `delta` object's state remains unchanged.

DONE.
