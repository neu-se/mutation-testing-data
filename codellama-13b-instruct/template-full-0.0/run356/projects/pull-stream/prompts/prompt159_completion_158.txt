  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `_value + 1`. This could potentially cause issues if the value of `_value` is not what was expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `_value - 1`. This could potentially cause issues if the value of `_value` is not what was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `_value * 2`. This could potentially cause issues if the value of `_value` is not what was expected.

DONE.
