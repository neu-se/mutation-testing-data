  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that checks if a string contains a certain substring, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. In this case, `includes` would always return `false` because `node.js` is not a substring of `module.js`, which would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `false` even if the stack line contains `node.js`.

DONE.
