  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This code fragment checks if the `coordinates` property of the `point` object is not an array, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This code fragment checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is not equal to 2, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] !== point.coordinates[1]
```
This code fragment checks if the first element of the `coordinates` array is not equal to the second element, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

DONE.
