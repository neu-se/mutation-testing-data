currentUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr == null` would return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is null or undefined, while `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` only returns `true` if `currentUrlStr` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because `!currentUrlStr` would return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is falsy (e.g. null, undefined, NaN, empty string, etc.), while `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` only returns `true` if `currentUrlStr` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrlStr.trim() === ''` would return `true` if `currentUrlStr` is an empty string after trimming, while `typeof currentUrlStr ===
