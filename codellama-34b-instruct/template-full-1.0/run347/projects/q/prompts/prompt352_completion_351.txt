  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("buggy")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a new error object, instead of the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("buggy")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error object, instead of returning a rejected promise with the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with an undefined value, instead of a rejected promise with the original exception.

DONE.
