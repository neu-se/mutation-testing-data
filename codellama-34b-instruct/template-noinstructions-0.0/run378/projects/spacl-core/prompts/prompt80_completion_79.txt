  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to be called on the `rule` object, which would check if the `path` matches the rule's pattern. However, the original code fragment was calling the `matches` method on the `Policy` object, which would check if the `path` matches any of the policy's rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called on the `rule` object, which would check if the `path` and `verb` combination matches the rule's pattern. However, the original code fragment was calling the `query` method on the `Policy` object, which would check if the `path` and `verb` combination matches any of the policy's rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone
