  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `abort` to be a boolean value, but `null` is a falsy value, so the `if (abort)` block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `abort` to be a boolean value, but `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if (abort)` block would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `abort` to be a boolean value, but `!abort` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `abort`, so the `if (abort)` block would be executed when it should not be.

DONE.
