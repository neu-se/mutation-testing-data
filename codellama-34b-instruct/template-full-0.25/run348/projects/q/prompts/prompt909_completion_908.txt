  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise that is already resolved with the value 0, instead of waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise that is already resolved with the value -1, instead of waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise that is already resolved with the value null, instead of waiting for the timeout to expire.

DONE.
