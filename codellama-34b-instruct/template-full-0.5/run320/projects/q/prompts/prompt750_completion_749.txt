  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if it is greater than 0. If `pendingCount` is greater than 0, the replacement code would always enter the `if` block, even if all promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if it is equal to the length of the `promises` array. If `pendingCount` is equal to the length of the `promises` array, the replacement code would always enter the `if` block, even if not all promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
