 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the locally scoped `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` argument passed to the function. This could cause issues if the `fs` module imported through `require('graceful-fs')` has different behavior than the one from `require('fs')`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
