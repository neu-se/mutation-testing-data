  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain + newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the `retain` property to be incremented instead of decremented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain - newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used instead of the `+` operator, which would cause the `retain` property to be decremented instead of incremented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain * newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the `retain
