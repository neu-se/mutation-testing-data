  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, "stack", {value: null, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `stack` property of the `promise` object with `null`, rather than the `stack` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, "stack", {value: undefined, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `stack` property of the `error` object with `undefined`, rather than the `stack` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, "stack", {value: "foo", configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `stack` property of the `promise` object with the string `"foo"`, rather than the `stack` property.

DONE.
