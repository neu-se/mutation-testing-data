  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `abort` and `false` are truthy, and if so, returns `false`. If `abort` is `true`, the `if` statement will evaluate to `false`, even if `op` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `op` or `false` are truthy, and if so, returns `true`. If `op` is `false`, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true`, even if `abort` is `true`.
