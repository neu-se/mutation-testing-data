  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length
```
This code fragment will cause the `gettype` function to throw an error if `pageurl` is not a string, as it will try to access the `length` property of a non-string object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http")
```
This code fragment will cause the `gettype` function to throw an error if `pageurl` does not contain the string "http", as it will try to access the `indexOf` method of a non-string object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.split("/")
```
This code fragment will cause the `gettype` function to throw an error if `pageurl` is not a string, as it will try to access the `split` method of a non-string object.

DONE.
