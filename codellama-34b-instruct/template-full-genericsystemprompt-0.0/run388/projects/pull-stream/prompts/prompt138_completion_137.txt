  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate(end))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `generate` function with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `generate` function without any arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
