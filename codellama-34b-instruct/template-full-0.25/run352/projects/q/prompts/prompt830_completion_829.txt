  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a null callback, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with an undefined callback, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with an empty function callback, which would not cause any errors to be thrown.

DONE.
