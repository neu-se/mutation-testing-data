  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, which is the `callback` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `args` array, which is not expected by the `callback` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the `args` array, which could cause the `callback` function to receive the arguments in the wrong order.

DONE.
