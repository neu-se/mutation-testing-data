  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the second argument instead of the third, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the third argument instead of the second, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 2, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start from the second argument and take only one argument, which could cause the `dispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments.

DONE.
