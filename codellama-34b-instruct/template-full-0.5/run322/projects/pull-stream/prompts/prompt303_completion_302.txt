  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, causing the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will return `true` if both `ended` and `true` are truthy, which would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `true` if either `ended` or `false` is truthy, which would cause the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
