  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points, while the modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere.

DONE.
