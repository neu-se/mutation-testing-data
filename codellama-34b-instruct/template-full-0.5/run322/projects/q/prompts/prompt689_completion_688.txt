  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would not pass the same arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" creates a new function with the provided arguments bound to it, whereas "apply" calls the function with the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because "test" is not a method of the Function prototype and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
