  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && abort` would only evaluate to `true` if both `err` and `abort` are truthy, whereas `err || abort` would evaluate to `true` if either `err` or `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ^ abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ^ abort` would evaluate to `true` if either `err` or `abort` is truthy, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err || abort` would evaluate to `true` if `err` is falsy or `abort` is truthy, whereas `err || abort` would only evaluate to `true` if `err` is truthy or `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
