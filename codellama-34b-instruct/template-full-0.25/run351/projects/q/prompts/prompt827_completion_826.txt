  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an unhandled error occurs in a promise chain. Setting it to `null` would prevent it from being called, which could cause unhandled errors to go unnoticed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Unhandled error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error whenever an unhandled error occurs in a promise chain, which could cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.error("Unhandled error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log an error message to the console whenever an unhandled error occurs in a promise chain, which could help with debugging.

DONE.
