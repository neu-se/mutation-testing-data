 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]/) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `search` instead of `match`, and checks for the presence of invalid characters instead of the absence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]/.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `test` method of a regular expression instead of `match` or `search`, which returns a boolean indicating the presence of invalid characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `match` method, effectively checking for the presence of invalid characters instead of the absence.
