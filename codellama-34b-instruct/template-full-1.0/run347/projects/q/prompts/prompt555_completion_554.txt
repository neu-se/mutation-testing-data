  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` would not be called in the case of an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the error to the console, but not propagate it to the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be thrown, which would be unrelated to the original error.

DONE.
