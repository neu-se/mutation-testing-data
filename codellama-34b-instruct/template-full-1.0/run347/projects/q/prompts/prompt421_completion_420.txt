  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `!isPromise(object)` since it would effectively invert the condition, making the `if` statement always true. This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state === "fulfilled"` check would always pass, causing the function to enter the `if` statement and `return inspected.value` even if the promise has been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `object instanceof Promise` since it would be a different way of checking if `object` is a Promise. This would result in different behavior because if `object` is not a Promise, the `!isPromise(object)` check would pass, causing the function to enter the `if` statement and `return inspected.value` even if the promise has been rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `isPromiseAlike(object)` since it would check if `object` is a promise-like object (i.e., an object with a `then` method). This would result in different behavior because if `object` is a promise-
