  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object, and `arg` is not defined in the provided code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object, and `re` is not defined in the provided code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` and `phi` are different properties of the `a` object, and `im` is not defined in the provided code.

DONE.
