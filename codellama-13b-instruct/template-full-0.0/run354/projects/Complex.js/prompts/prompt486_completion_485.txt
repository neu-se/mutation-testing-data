  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperties
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Object.defineProperty` to define a property on an object, while the modified code fragment uses `Object.defineProperties` to define multiple properties on an object. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the specific behavior of `Object.defineProperty`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Object.defineProperty` to define a property on the `Complex` object, while the modified code fragment uses `Object.defineProperty` to define a property on the `Complex` object and set its value to `true`. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the specific behavior of `Object.defineProperty`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule",
