  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `otherOp`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `otherOp`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
