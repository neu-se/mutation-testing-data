  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which will cause the regular expression to be tested against all possible matches in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which will cause the regular expression to be case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which will cause the regular expression to be tested against multiple lines in the string, rather than just the first line.

DONE.
