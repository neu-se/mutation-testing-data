  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object with the `allTimezones` property set to `true`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
