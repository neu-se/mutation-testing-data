  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `true` instead of `false` when the action is explicitly allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `null` instead of `false` when the combination of path and action is not governed by the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `false` instead of `true` when the action is explicitly allowed.

DONE.
