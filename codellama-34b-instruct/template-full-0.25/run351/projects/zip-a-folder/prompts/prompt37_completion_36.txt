  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `glob` method to be called even if `src` is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `directory` method to be called even if `src` is a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `glob` method to be called even if `src` is not a glob.

DONE.
