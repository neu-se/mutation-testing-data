  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object, while `row.key === undefined` checks if the `key` property is equal to `undefined`. If the `key` property is not defined, the first check would return `true`, while the second check would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object, while `!row.hasOwnProperty('key')` checks if the `key` property is not defined in the `row` object or in any of its prototypes. If the `key` property is defined in a prototype, the first check would return `true`, while the second check would return `false`.
