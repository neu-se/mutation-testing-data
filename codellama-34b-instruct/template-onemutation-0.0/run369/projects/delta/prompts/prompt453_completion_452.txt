  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `this.offset` to 0, but the mutated code sets it to 1. This could cause the `peekLength()` method to return a different value, potentially causing the `hasNext()` method to return a different result.

DONE.
