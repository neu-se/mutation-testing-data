```
(Array.apply(0,Array(1000)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array of length 1000, which would cause the code to throw an error due to exceeding the call stack size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){throw 'Exception in Deeper Promises';})
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a function that throws an exception when called and would cause the code to throw that exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a function, so the code would throw a TypeError.

DONE.
