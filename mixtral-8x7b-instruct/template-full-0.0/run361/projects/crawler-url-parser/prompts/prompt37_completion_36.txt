 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return `null` when the `baseUrlStr` is not provided and the `currentUrlStr` does not start with a protocol, whereas the original code would add 'http://' to the beginning of `currentUrlStr` in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not ignore the fragment (the part after '#') of the URL, whereas the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to use a different set of URL parse options, which could affect the parsing of the URL. For example, if the `slashesDenoteHost` option is set
