Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.emit('error', new Error('Close failed'))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of closing the streams, it emits an error indicating that the close operation failed, which could lead to resource leaks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `end()` on the write stream without checking if there are any in-flight writes, potentially leading to data loss if there are pending writes that have not yet been completed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it clears the queue of callbacks without closing the streams, which could lead to callbacks being lost and not executed, affecting the integrity of the data persistence process.

DONE.
