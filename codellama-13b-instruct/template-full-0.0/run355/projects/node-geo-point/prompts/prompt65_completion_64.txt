  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to Δλ would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from Δλ would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of Δλ by 2 would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 2 degrees.

DONE.
