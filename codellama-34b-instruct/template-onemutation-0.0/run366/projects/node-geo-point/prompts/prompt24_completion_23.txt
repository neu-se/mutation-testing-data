  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, but `object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')` is a function call that checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, and it will return `true` if the property exists and is not inherited from the object's prototype.

DONE.
