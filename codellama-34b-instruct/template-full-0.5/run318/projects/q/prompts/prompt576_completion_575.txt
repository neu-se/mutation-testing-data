  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to itself, which would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to `null`, which would cause the function to be called with `this` set to `null`, rather than the original `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `continuer` function to an anonymous function, which would cause the function to be called with `this` set to the anonymous function, rather than the original `continuer` function.

DONE.
