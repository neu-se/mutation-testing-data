  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `src` string on commas and then globs each part, whereas this new code fragment splits the `src` string on commas, globs each part, and then tries to glob each part again, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `src` string on commas and then globs each part, whereas this new code fragment splits the `src` string on commas, globs each part, and then tries to glob each part again with an empty options object, which would result in an error.
