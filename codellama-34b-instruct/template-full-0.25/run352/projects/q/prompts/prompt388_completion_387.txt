  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
