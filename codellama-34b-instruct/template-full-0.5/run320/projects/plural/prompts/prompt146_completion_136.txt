  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the first rule to the word, rather than the second rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the third rule to the word, rather than the second rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the fourth rule to the word, rather than the second rule.

DONE.
