  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.toUpperCase()` is a function that returns a new string with all characters in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.length` is a number representing the length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a string, but `data.split('')` is an array of strings, where each string is a single character from the original string.

DONE.
