  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` property would be set to `null`, which would prevent any error handlers from being called when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` property would be set to a function that throws an error when called, which would cause any error handlers to be called with a different error than the one that was originally thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror was called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` property would be set to a function that logs a message to the console when called, which would cause any error handlers to be called with a different context than the one that was originally
