 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
other.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array with the original and new elements, whereas `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
other.ops.splice
