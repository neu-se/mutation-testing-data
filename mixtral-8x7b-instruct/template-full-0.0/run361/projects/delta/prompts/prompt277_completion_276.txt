 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `peek` method, potentially causing issues if the method has side effects or if it relies on the current state of the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter['peek']
