  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `2` is a positive integer. In the original code, `10` is used, which is also a positive integer, but `2` is a different value and would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `-1` is not a positive integer. In the original code, `10` is used, which is a positive integer, but `-1` is a different value and would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it is not a positive integer. In the original code,
