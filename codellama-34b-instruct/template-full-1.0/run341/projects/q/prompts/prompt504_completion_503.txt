  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[0](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `value[0]` is a function, and `apply` is a method of functions in JavaScript. By replacing `apply` with `value[0]`, we are calling the function directly, without binding it to the `value` object. This could cause the function to be called with an incorrect `this` value, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.slice(name, name.length)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, and `()` is the array call operator in JavaScript. By replacing `apply` with `value.slice(name, name.length)()`, we are creating a new array and calling it as a function. This could cause a `TypeError` to be thrown, or the function to be called with incorrect arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name].call(
