  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is a method that emits an event, whereas `once` is a method that listens for an event to be emitted once. Using `emit` instead of `once` would cause the `close` event to be emitted multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that is listening for the `close` event.
