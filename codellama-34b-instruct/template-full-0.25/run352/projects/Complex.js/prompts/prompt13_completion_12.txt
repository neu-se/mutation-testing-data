  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || -b > x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which is a short-circuiting operator, meaning that if the first operand is truthy, the second operand is not evaluated. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `|` operator, which is a non-short-circuiting operator, meaning that both operands are always evaluated. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the second operand has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b || x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which is a short-circuiting operator, meaning that if the first operand is truthy, the second operand is not evaluated. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the `|` operator, which is a non-short-circuiting operator, meaning that both operands are always evaluated.
