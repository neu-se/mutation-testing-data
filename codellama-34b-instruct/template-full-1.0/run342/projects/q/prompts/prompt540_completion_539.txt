  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback, which would result in a rejection of the promise instead of a fulfillment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function, so the `fulfilled` callback would be called with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
