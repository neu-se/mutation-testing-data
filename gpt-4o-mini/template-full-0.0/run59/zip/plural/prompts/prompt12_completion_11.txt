Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|qu$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly matches words ending with 'qu' instead of 'quy', leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "soliloquy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 's' instead of changing 'y' to 'ies', which would incorrectly pluralize words like "cherry" to "cherrys" instead of "cherries".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last two characters instead of just the last one, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like
