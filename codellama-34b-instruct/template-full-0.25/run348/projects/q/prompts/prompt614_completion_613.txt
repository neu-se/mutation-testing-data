  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array resolves or rejects, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
