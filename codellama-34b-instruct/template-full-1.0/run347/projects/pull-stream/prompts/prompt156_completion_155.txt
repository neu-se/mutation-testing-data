  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `value === undefined` checks if `value` is strictly equal to `undefined`, whereas `value != null` checks if `value` is not equal to `null`. These conditions are not equivalent, as `undefined` is not the same as `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!value && onAbort` checks if `value` is falsy and `onAbort` is truthy, whereas `value != null` only checks if `value` is not equal to `null`. These conditions are not equivalent, as `value` could be a falsy value other than `null` (e.g. `false`, `0`, or an empty string).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.hasOwn
