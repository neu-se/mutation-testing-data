  mutation testing reveals potential issues with the test suite by modifying the code and checking if the tests fail. In this case, we can try replacing parts of the code to see if the tests will still succeed. As you mentioned, the following error can be fixed; the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([...]')'
```
This would result in different behavior in cases where the part after the `/`   and before the `/` is much longer than 99 characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/(/(/'))'
```
 Consider a case where thee is a triple slash between the part after the `/` and before the final `/`. The currrent REgEX pattern would fail in constant time whereas the modified one would fail in linear tieme.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/(_+(_/)?)?/'
``` 
 This modification would result in a nested optional group, which can  change the result of the
