  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, whereas the modified code fragment captures the last group of non-slash characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+?)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, whereas the modified code fragment captures the last group of non-slash characters, and the `?` makes the `+` quantifier non-greedy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the first group of non-slash characters, whereas the modified code fragment captures the last group of non-slash characters, and the `/` at the end of the fragment makes the regex engine try to match the next character as a slash.
