  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end) return cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would call `cb` with an error if `mapper` threw an error, while this new code would return `null` as the first argument to `cb`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
