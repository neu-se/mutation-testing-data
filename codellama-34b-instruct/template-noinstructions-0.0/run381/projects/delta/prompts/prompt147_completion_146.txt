  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the next element without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to check if there are any more elements in the sequence, potentially leading to a false positive or false negative in the mutation testing.

DONE.
