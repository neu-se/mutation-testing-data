  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) + θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the angle between the two points in radians, while the modified code fragment calculates the sum of the sine of the angle and the angle in radians. This would cause the `calculateBearing()` method to return a value that is different from the actual bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) + θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle between the two points in radians, while the modified code fragment calculates the sum of the cosine of the angle and the angle in radians. This would cause the `calculateBearing()` method to return a value that is different from the actual bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ) + θ
```
This would result in different
