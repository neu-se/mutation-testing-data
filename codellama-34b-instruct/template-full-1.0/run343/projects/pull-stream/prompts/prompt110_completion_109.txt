  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function would always be called with the initial value of 0, rather than the current value of "acc".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function would always be called with the initial value of null, rather than the current value of "acc".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function would always be called with the sum of "acc" and "data", rather than the current value of "acc".

DONE.
