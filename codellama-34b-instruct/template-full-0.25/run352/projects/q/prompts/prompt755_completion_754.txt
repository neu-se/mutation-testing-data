  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate(allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function would be called with the wrong arguments, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved.deprecate("allResolved", "allSettled");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function would be called on the wrong object, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deprecate(allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function would be called on the wrong object, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
