  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let difference = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of the `difference` variable, but the original code does not modify the value of `difference`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let difference = length - iter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of the `difference` variable based on the iter's next element, but the original code uses the current value of `difference` to determine the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let difference = length - <PLACEHOLDER>;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the value of the `difference` variable based on the current value of the cursor position, but the original code uses the current value of `difference` to determine the next element.

DONE.
