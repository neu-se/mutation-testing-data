  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a[key]` is not undefined, but this new code checks if `a[key]` is not null. This could cause the code to behave differently if `a[key]` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b[key]` is undefined, but this new code checks if `b[key]` is not undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently if `b[key]` is undefined.
