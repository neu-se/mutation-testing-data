  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `false`, which means that the `basis` variable will never be initialized, and the `reduce` method will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This code fragment will always evaluate to `true`, which means that the `basis` variable will always be initialized to the first element of the array, and the `reduce` method will work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This code fragment will evaluate to `true` if the `arguments` object has exactly two elements, and `false` otherwise. This means that the `basis` variable will be initialized to the first element of the array if the `arguments` object has exactly two elements, and the `reduce` method will work as expected.

DONE.
