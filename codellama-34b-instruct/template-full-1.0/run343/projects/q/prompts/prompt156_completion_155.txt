  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the stack trace of the first promise in the chain, while the original code would return the concatenated stack trace of all promises in the chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the stack traces, so the stack trace of the last promise in the chain would be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all but the first and last stack traces, which could be useful for debugging a chain of promises where the first and last promises are not relevant.

DONE.
