  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `peekType()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` property is being accessed instead of the `peekType()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType.call(thisIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method is being used to call the `peekType()` method on the `thisIter` object.

DONE.
