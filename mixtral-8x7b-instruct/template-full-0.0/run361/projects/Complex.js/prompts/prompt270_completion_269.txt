 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'], this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would affect the result of the 'abs' method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the real and imaginary parts instead of passing them as separate arguments to the 'hypot' function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot(this['re'], this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Math.hypot function instead of the 'hypot' function, which may have different rounding behavior or may not be supported in some JavaScript environments.

DONE.
