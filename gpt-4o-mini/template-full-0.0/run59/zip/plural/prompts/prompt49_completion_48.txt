Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the pluralization rule for words ending in a consonant followed by 'o', which should add 'es' instead of 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly changes the pluralization rule to add 'ies' for words ending in a consonant followed by 'o', which is not a standard pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends both 's' and 'es' to words ending in a consonant followed by 'o', which is not a valid pluralization and would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
