  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.pop()` returns the last element of the buffer, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` returns the last element and removes it from the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.shift()` returns the first element of the buffer, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` returns the last element and removes it from the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.slice(-1)` returns the last element of the buffer, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` returns the last element and removes it from the buffer.

DONE.
