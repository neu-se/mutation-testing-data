  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it will treat the `urlMap` as a string instead of a map object, and will throw an error when attempting to call the `values()` method.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `null` instead of a URL object, and the `gettype()` function will not be able to extract the URL type.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
new Map()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will create an empty map object instead of the intended `urlMap` object, and the `gettype()` function will not be able to extract the URL type.

DONE.
