  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys() would return an empty array instead of an array of object keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys() would throw a TypeError instead of returning an array of object keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because Object.keys() would return an array of object keys, but the array would not be in the expected order.

DONE.
