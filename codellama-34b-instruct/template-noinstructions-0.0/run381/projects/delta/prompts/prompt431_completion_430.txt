  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!length` checks if the `length` variable is falsy, while `length === 0` checks if it is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!length` checks if the `length` variable is falsy, while `length < 0` checks if it is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!length` checks if the `length` variable is falsy, while `length !== 0` checks if it is not equal to 0.

DONE.
