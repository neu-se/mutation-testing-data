  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a string literal, whereas the original code fragment was calling the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it is an empty array, whereas the original code fragment was calling the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a number literal, whereas the original code fragment was calling the `arguments` object.

DONE.
