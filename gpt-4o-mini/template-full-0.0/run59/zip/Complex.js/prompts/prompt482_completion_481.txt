Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero instead of checking if it is finite, which would lead to incorrect results for non-zero finite complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `isFinite` check, causing the function to return true for infinite values instead of false, leading to incorrect identification of finite complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part of the complex number is infinite, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to false positives for finite complex numbers with a finite imaginary part.

DONE.
