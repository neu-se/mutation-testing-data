  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would cause the promise to be fulfilled, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with an array of all the values in the input array, whereas `Q` would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
