  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a built-in JavaScript object and would not have a `dispatch` method, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which would not have a `dispatch` method, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have a `dispatch` method, causing an error.

DONE.
