Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of rejecting the promise would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in subsequent `.then()` calls.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve("Error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the promise with a string message instead of rejecting it would change the control flow, allowing the promise to be fulfilled with a message rather than indicating an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("Custom error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting the promise with a custom error message instead of the original exception would alter the error handling in the promise chain, potentially leading to different error handling logic being executed.

DONE.
