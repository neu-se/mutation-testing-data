 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `ret.host` property with a hardcoded string, which would not have the same properties as the original `ret.host` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `ret.host` property with `null`, which would cause any further attempts to access properties of `ret.host` to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `ret.host` property with a random number, which would not have any of the properties or methods of the original `ret.host` object.

DONE.
