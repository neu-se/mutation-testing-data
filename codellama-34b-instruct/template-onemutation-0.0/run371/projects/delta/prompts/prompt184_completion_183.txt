  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is a number, while the new code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `compose` method to behave differently when it encounters a `retain` operation with a string value.

DONE.
