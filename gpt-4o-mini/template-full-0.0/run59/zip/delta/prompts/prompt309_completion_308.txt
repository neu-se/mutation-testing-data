Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line = new Delta(this.ops);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes `line` with a copy of `this.ops`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the current line's operations instead of starting with an empty `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { someAttribute: true }, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an object with a fixed attribute instead of an empty object, which could affect how the predicate function processes the line and its attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the index `i` by 1 when calling the predicate, which could lead to incorrect indexing when processing multiple lines.

DONE.
