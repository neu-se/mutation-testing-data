Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last operation from the `ops` array regardless of whether it meets the condition of being a retain operation with no attributes, potentially leading to unintended data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument to `pop` is not valid; it would not remove any element from the array, thus leaving the last operation unchanged even if it should have been removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(lastOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to pop the last operation using `lastOp` as an argument, which is not how the `pop` method works; it would not remove the last element and could lead to confusion or errors in the logic.

DONE.
