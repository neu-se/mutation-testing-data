  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that have been fulfilled, and would ignore any promises that have been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that have been rejected, and would ignore any promises that have been fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider promises that are still pending, and would ignore any promises that have been fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
