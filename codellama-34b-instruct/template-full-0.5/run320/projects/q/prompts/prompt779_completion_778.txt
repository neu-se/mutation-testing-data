  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value, which would change the fulfillment value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, which would change the rejection reason of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("Test rejection"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new rejection reason, which would change the rejection reason of the promise.

DONE.
