  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!priority` would negate the priority flag, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority, arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` flag would be passed as the first argument to the `transformPosition` method, potentially causing it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg + 1` would offset the `index` parameter by 1, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

DONE.
