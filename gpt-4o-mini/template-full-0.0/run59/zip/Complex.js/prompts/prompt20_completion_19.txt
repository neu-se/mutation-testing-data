Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `a` or `b` is greater than 3000, which would lead to the square root calculation being skipped for values that should be processed, potentially causing incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a <= 3000 && b <= 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the less than or equal operator, which would allow values of exactly 3000 to pass through, potentially leading to incorrect calculations when the original logic intended to exclude those values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 1000 && b < 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the threshold from 3000 to 1000, meaning that many values that were previously processed would now be skipped, leading to incorrect results for a wider range of inputs.

DONE.
