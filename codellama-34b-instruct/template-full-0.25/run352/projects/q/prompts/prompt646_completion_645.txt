  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is not bound to any object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method with `this` as the `this` value, whereas `this.dispatch` does not specify a `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method with `this` as the `this` value and an empty argument list, whereas `this.dispatch` does not specify a `this` value or any arguments.

DONE.
