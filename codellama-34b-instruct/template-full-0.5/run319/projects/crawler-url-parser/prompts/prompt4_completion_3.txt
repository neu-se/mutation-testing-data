  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the base URL has illegal characters instead of the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr || _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if the current URL is falsy or has illegal characters, instead of returning `null` only if the current URL is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current URL has illegal characters and if the base URL is truthy, instead of checking if the current URL has illegal characters only.

DONE.
