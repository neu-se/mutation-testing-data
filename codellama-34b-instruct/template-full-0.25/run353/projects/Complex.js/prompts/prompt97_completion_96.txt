  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a['re'] + b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real parts of `a` and `b` instead of the real part of `a` and the imaginary part of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a['re'] - b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the real parts of `a` and `b` instead of the real part of `a` and the imaginary part of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a['re'] * b['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real parts of `a` and `b` instead of the real part of `a` and the imaginary part of `b`.

DONE.
