  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array instead of an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a random timezone object instead of the one corresponding to the given name, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects that are not necessarily related to the given timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with the same name as the given name, but with a different set of countries, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an array of country objects that are not necessarily related to the given timezone.
