  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and attempting to call it as one would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and attempting to call it as a function would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a function, and attempting to call it as one would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
