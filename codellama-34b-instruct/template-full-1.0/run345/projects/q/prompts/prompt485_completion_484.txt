  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
        <option>slice(0, 0)</option>
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method returns [0] which means the output array starts from index 0.

Option 2: The PLCAEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        <option>slice(1, 1)</option>
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method returns [1] which means the output array starts from index 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        <option>slice(2, 2)</option>
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice() method returns [2] which means the output array starts from index 2.

DONE
