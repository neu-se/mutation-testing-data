  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the target base path, which could change the directory that the zip file is written to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first character of the target base path, which could change the directory that the zip file is written to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first part of the target base path, which could change the directory that the zip file is written to.

DONE.
