  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, instead of passing it as a callback to `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, instead of passing it as a callback to `setTimeout`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function after a delay of 1000 milliseconds, instead of immediately.

DONE.
