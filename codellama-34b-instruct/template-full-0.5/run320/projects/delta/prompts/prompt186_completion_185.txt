  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be truthy, so the `if` statement would never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be falsy, so the `if` statement would always execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for null explicitly, and the `if` statement would only execute if `thisOp.retain` is null.

DONE.
