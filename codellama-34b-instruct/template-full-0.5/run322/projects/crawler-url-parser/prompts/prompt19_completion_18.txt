  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of "http://" with "https://" in the base URL string, which may not be intended and could cause issues with the URL parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all occurrences of "http://" from the base URL string, which may not be intended and could cause issues with the URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of "http://" with "ftp://" in the base URL string, which may not be intended and could cause issues with the URL parsing.

DONE.
