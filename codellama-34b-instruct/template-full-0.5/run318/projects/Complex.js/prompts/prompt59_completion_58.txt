  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` checks if a value is not finite, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` performs addition, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

DONE.
