  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'LineString';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `type` property of the input object to be `'Point'`, but by setting it to `'LineString'`, the method will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [100, 100];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `coordinates` property of the input object to be an array of two numbers, but by setting it to `[100, 100]`, the method will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = ['100', '100'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `coordinates` property of the input object to be an array of two numbers, but by setting it to
