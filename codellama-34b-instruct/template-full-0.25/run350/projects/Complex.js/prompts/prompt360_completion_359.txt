  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the code would be using the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different variable than `b`, and the code would be using the wrong variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because `2*a` is a different expression than `b`, and the code would be using the wrong value.

DONE.
