  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Q(bound)` creates a new `Q` object while `Q(bound)` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var $ = bound;
```
This would result in different behavior because `var $ = bound` assigns `bound` to the variable `$` while `Q(bound)` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q("hello")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q("hello")` creates a new promise for the string "hello" while `Q(bound)` does not.

DONE.
