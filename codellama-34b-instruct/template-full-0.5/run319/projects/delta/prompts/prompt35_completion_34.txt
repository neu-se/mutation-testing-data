  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for both null and undefined values, while the original code only checks for null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null && b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for both null and undefined values, while the original code only checks for null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(b, 'constructor')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks for the presence of the `constructor` property on the object, while the original code only checks for the presence of the `constructor` property on the `Object` prototype.

DONE.
