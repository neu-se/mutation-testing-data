  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the next element in the array instead of the current element, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the element at the current index multiplied by 2, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
