  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` will evaluate to `undefined`, which means that the function will not be called with any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid function argument, but it will not be called with the expected array argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` will evaluate to `undefined`, which means that the function will not be called with any arguments.

DONE.
