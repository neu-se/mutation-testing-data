  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is performing a subtraction operation, while this suggestion is performing an addition operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is performing a subtraction operation, while this suggestion is performing a subtraction operation with the operands reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData - opData
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is performing a subtraction operation, while this suggestion is performing a subtraction operation with the operands reversed.

DONE.
