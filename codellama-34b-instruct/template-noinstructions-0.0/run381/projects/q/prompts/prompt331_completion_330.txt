  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with a rejected promise, which would trigger the `when` method's rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with an error, which would trigger the `when` method's rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be called with `undefined`, which would trigger the `when` method's rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

DONE.
