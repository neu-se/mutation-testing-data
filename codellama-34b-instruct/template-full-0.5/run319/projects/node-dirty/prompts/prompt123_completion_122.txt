  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `_flush` if the queue is not empty and the stream is not waiting for a drain, while this new code will always call `_flush`, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any arguments to `_flush`, while this new code passes the size of the queue as an argument, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.size, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any arguments to `_flush`, while this new code passes the size of the queue and a boolean value as arguments, which could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
