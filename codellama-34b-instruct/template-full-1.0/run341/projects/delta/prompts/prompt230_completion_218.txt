  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the length of the text, which would cause the diff algorithm to not consider any insertions or deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the first string, which may not be equal to the length of the second string, causing the diff algorithm to not consider any insertions or deletions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the second string, which may not be equal to the length of the first string, causing the diff algorithm to not consider any insertions or deletions.

DONE.
