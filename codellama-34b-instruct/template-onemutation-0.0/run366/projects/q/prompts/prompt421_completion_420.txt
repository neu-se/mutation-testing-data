  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `value` is not a promise, and `false` when it is a promise. This would cause the `inspected.value` to be returned instead of the `value` itself, which would change the behavior of the `nearer` function.

DONE.
