 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the original condition, causing the callback to be invoked even if the end of the stream has not been reached or the data does not match the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length > 0 && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the test function has a length greater than 0 and if the data matches the test, which is different from the original condition that checks if the end of the stream has been reached and if the data does not match the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data is falsy or if the data matches the test, which is different from the original condition that checks if the end of the stream has been reached and if the data does not match the test.

DONE.
