Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the case where one of the complex numbers is zero as if it were infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results in multiplication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if the other complex number is infinite, which could lead to incorrect handling of multiplication involving zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, allowing the multiplication to proceed even when both complex numbers are infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
