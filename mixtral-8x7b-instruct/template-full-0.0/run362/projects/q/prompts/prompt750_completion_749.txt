 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is not triggered even if all input promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is triggered regardless of the input promises' states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection of the promise is triggered when the input promises array is empty, even if there are no rejections among the input promises.

DONE.
