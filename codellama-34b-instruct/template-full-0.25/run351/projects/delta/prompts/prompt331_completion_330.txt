  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, which may not exist or have a different value than the original `baseOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `baseOp` object, which may not be the same as the length of the original `baseOp` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `baseOp` object, starting from index 0 and ending at index 1, which may not be the same as the original `baseOp` object.

DONE.
