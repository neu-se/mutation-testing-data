  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check the type of operation in `this` instead of `other` which would potentially produce different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check the length of operation in `other` which is different from other.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return the next element in `this` instead of `other` which would potentially produce different output.

DONE.
