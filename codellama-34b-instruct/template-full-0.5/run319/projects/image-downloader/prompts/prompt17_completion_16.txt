  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.split(".").shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `decodedBasename` is a string, while the new code fragment `decodedBasename.split(".").shift()` returns an array of strings. This change would cause the function to behave differently when handling file extensions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `decodedBasename` is a string, while the new code fragment `decodedBasename.toLowerCase()` returns a new string with all characters in lowercase. This change would cause the function to behave differently when handling case-sensitive file names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `decodeURIComponent(basename)` is a string, while the new code fragment
