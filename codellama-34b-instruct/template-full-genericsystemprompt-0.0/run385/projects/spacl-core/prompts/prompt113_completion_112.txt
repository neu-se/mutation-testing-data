  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the verb is in the `verbs` object, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `verb` property in the `verbs` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of the value of the `verb` property in the `verbs` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`.

DONE.
