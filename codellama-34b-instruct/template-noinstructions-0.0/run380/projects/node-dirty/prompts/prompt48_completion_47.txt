  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the value returned by `this.get(key)`, which may not be the same as the value stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the value returned by `this.get(key)`, which may not be the same as the value stored in the database.
