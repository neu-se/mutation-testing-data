  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` is the negation of `err`, which means that the code will only execute the `next` function if `err` is falsy, whereas the original code executes the `next` function if `err` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.message` is a string, whereas `err` is an object. The code will only execute the `next` function if `err` is truthy and has a `message` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.code` is a number, whereas `err` is an object. The code will only execute the `next` function if `err` is truthy and has a `code` property.

DONE.
