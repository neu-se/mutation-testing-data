  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not be called, and therefore the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).dispatch('resolve')
```
This would result in different behavior because the dispatch method would not be called on the promise, and therefore the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {
    throw new Error('test');
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the generated error would not be caught by the `when` function, and therefore the promise would not be rejected.

DONE.
