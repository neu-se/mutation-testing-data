  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "put".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed from "post" to "delete".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"notDefinedMethod", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name is changed to a non-existent method.

DONE.
