  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, and would cause the `dispatch` method to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` returns a promise that is rejected, and would cause the `dispatch` method to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {}())
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns undefined, and would cause the `dispatch` method to return undefined instead of a promise.

DONE.
