  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match case-insensitively, so it would also match strings that contain uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match across multiple lines, so it would also match strings that contain newline characters.

DONE.
