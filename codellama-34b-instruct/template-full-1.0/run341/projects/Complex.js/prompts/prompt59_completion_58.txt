  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Number.isNaN```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite, meaning it neither infinite nor NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Number.isSafeInteger```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if a value is an integer, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```1 / x```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / x` returns the reciprocal of `x`, while `Number.isFinite` checks if a value is finite.

DONE.
