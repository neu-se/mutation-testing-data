 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return an empty array instead of potentially returning the keys of a given object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return `null` instead of an array when the input is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return an array of keys when the input is an object, instead of the values of the object.

DONE.
