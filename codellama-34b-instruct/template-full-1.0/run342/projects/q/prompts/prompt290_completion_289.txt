  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because when the resolver function is called with the value, it would reject the deferred promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise to be in a rejected state instead of a resolved state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because when the resolver function is called with the value, it would fulfill the deferred promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise to be in a fulfilled state instead of a resolved state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because when the resolver function is called with the value, it would notify the deferred promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise to be in a notified state instead of a resolved state.

DONE.
