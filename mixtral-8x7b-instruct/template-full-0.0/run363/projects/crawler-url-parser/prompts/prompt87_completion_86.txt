 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('href', 'broken_link')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed value 'broken\_link' to all 'a' elements' href attributes, instead of keeping their original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).text('Replaced Text')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the text of all 'a' elements to 'Replaced Text', instead of keeping their original text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let text = $(this).text() + '<script>malicious_code</script>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it injects a malicious script tag into the text content of all 'a' elements, which might not be present in the original code.

DONE.
