  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function returns an object with a `state` property, but the `inspect.state` property is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` function returns an object with a `state` property, but the `inspect().state` property is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.apply(this).state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect.apply(this)` function returns an object with a `state` property, but the `inspect.apply(this).state` property is not defined.

DONE.
