  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` is a reference to the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation in the other iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` is a reference to the `next` method of the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.next()` would return the next operation in the `newOp` object, whereas `thisIter.next` is a reference to the `next` method of the current iterator.

DONE.
