  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 degrees would cause the result to be off by a multiple of 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `Math.PI` to the angle `θ` would cause the result to be off by `Math.PI` radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting `Math.PI` from the angle `θ` would cause the result to be off by `Math.PI` radians in the opposite direction.

DONE.
