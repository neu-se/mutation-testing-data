  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes a single argument to the `mapper` function, while this modified code passes two arguments. This could potentially cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a non-null value as the second argument to the `mapper` function, while this modified code passes `null`. This could potentially cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a non-zero value as the second argument to the `mapper` function, while this modified code passes `0`. This could potentially cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, depending on its implementation.
