  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of the expression, so if `result[country]` is truthy, the expression would evaluate to `false`, and if it is falsy, it would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `result[country]` is `undefined`, the expression would evaluate to `true`, and if it is any other value, it would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `result[country]` is not `undefined`, the expression would evaluate to `true`, and if it is `undefined`, it would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
