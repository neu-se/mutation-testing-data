  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` method on the `head` object, which is not the same as calling the `task` function with the `domain` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call(domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` function with the `domain` object as the `this` context, which is not the same as calling the `task` function with the `domain` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.apply(domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` function with the `domain` object as the `this` context and an empty argument list, which is not the same as calling the `task` function with the `domain` argument.

DONE.
