  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds towards positive infinity, whereas `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds towards the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` rounds towards zero, whereas `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity.

DONE.
