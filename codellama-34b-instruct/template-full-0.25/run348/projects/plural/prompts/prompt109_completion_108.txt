  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')es\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w}
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now looking for words that end in "es" instead of "s".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'g'), function(w) { return w}
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now using the "g" flag to match all occurrences of the pattern instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|')
