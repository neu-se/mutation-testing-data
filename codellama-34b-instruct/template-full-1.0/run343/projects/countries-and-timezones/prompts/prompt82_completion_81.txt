  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new function that returns the result of `getCountry(c, options)`, while the modified code fragment creates a new function that returns an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getCountry(c, { ...options, deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment passes a different value for the `deprecated` option to `getCountry`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified code fragment calls `getTimezone` instead of `getCountry`.

DONE.
