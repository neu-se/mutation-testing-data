  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` is a different property than `ret.host`, and it may not be defined in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host + "." + ret.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `host` and `domain` properties with a dot in between, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split(".")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `host` property on dots and return the first part, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
