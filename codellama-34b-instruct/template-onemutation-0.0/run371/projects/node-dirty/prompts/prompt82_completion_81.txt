  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means the chunk does not contain a newline character. The modified code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is not -1, which means the chunk contains a newline character. This change would cause the code to behave differently when processing chunks that do not contain newline characters.

DONE.
