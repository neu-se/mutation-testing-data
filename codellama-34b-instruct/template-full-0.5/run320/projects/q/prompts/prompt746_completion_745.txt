  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onProgress` function with `null` as an argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onRejected` function instead of the `onProgress` function, which would likely cause a different outcome in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `onProgress` function with an empty function, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
