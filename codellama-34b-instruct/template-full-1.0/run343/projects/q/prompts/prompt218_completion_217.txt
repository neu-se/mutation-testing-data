  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a promise resolved with the value "fulfilled", while this new code fragment would return a string "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a promise resolved with the value "fulfilled", while this new code fragment would return a string "rejected".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a promise resolved with the value "fulfilled", while this new code fragment would return a string "pending".

DONE.
