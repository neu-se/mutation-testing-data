  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (spec.match(/\/\//) !== null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of `//` in the `spec` string, which was used in the `Matcher` class to check for empty segments in the path specification. Replacing it with `if (spec.match(/\/\//) !== null) {` would cause the code to check for the presence of `//` in the `spec` string, but return `null` if it is not found, instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (spec.match(/\/*) !== null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of `//` in the `spec` string, which was used in the `Matcher` class to check for empty segments in the path specification. Replacing it with `if (spec.match(/\/*) !== null) {` would cause the code to check
