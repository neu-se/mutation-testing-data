Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would incorrectly calculate the sine of the angle instead of the cosine, leading to an incorrect result in the destination calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cos` with `1` would ignore the angle entirely, effectively treating the cosine of the angle as a constant value of 1, which would distort the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using `tan` instead of `cos` would change the trigonometric function used in the calculation, leading to an incorrect computation of the destination point based on the tangent of the angle instead of the cosine.

DONE.
