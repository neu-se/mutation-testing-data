  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `Array.isArray` check, potentially causing the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw an error when it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of the `point.coordinates` array, potentially causing the `fromLngLatArray` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of the `point.coordinates` array, potentially causing the `fromLngLatArray` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
