  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `data`, which means that the `if` statement would be entered if `data` is falsy, rather than if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `data`, which means that the `if` statement would be entered if `data` is greater than 1, rather than if it is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator subtracts 1 from the value of `data`, which means that the `if` statement would be entered if `data` is less than 1, rather than if it is equal to 1.

DONE.
