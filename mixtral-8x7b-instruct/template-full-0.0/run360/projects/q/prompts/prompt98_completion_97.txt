 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index + 1` uses the addition operator instead of the post-increment operator. This could lead to different behavior if the `index` variable is not a number or if the `index` variable is used in the same expression after the `index + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++index` uses the pre-increment operator instead of the post-increment operator. This could lead to different behavior if the `index` variable is used in the same expression before the `++index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index = index + 1` uses an assignment operator instead of the post-increment operator. This could lead to different behavior if the `index` variable is used in the same
