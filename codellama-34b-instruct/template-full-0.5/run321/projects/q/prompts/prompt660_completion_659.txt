  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` would reject the promise, while `this.dispatch` would dispatch the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch(deferred.reject)` would reject the promise, while `this.dispatch` would dispatch the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch(deferred.resolve)` would resolve the promise, while `this.dispatch` would dispatch the promise.

DONE.
