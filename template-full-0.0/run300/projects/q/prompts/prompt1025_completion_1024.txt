  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a pending promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when(Q)` returns a resolved promise with the value `Q`, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
