  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive `null` as the fulfilled value, instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive `undefined` as the fulfilled value, instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would receive `0` as the fulfilled value, instead of the original value.

DONE.
