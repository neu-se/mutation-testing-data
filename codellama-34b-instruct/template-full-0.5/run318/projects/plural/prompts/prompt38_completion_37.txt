  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the word "corpus", which would not be matched by the original fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus|[^x]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the character class `[^x]`, which would match any character that is not "x", whereas the original fragment only matches "appendix" or "index".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|corpus|[^x]|[^i]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the new fragment includes the character class `[^i]`, which would match any character that is not "i", whereas the original fragment only matches "appendix" or "index".

DONE.
