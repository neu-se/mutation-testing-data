  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop() === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.pop()` returns the last element of the queue, while `laterQueue.length` returns the length of the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(laterQueue.pop())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Boolean` is a function that returns `true` if the argument is truthy, and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which returns `true` if the argument is falsy, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
