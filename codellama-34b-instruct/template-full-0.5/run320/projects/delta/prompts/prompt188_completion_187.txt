  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function expects the first argument to be an object with an `insert` property, but `'retain'` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a number, but the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function expects the first argument to be an object with an `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a number, but the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function expects the first argument to be an object with an `insert` property.

DONE.
