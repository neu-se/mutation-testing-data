  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This change will cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id)
```
This change will cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return the country object for the given timezone, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This change will cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return the timezone object for the given country, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
