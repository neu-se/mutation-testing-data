  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event even if the key already exists in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(this._data, [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event with the key as the only argument, whereas the original code fragment emits an event with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(this._queue, [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an event from the `_queue` map, whereas the original code fragment emits an event from the `this` object.

DONE.
