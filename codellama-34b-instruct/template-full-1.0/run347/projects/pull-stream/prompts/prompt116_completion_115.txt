  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is a boolean value, while `err, acc` is an array of two values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is a value, while `err, acc` is an array of two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, while `err, acc` is not an object.

DONE.
