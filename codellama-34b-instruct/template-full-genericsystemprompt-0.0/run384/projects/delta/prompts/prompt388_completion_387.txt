  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called with a different argument, which could change the length of the peeked operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called on a different iterator, which could have a different length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function is called with different arguments, which could change the minimum length of the peeked operations.

DONE.
