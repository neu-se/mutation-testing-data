  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first and last elements of the `tokens` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start from the last element of the `tokens` array and loop until it reaches the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i = tokens.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `tokens` array in reverse order, starting from the last element, and would skip every other element.

DONE.
