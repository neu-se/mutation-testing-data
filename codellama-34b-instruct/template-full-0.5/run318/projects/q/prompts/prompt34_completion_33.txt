  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is not defined, so the `runSingle` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is now `null`, so the `runSingle` function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is now `0`, so the `runSingle` function would not be called.

DONE.
