  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.cos```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of an angle, whereas `Math.tan` returns the tangent of an angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.random()```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), whereas `Math.tan` returns the tangent of an angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.sqrt```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.tan` returns the tangent of an angle.

DONE.
