  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('drain'));
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drain' is not a valid event name, so it would cause an error to be emitted instead of the expected 'drain' event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', true);
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument 'true' is added to the 'drain' event, which would cause the event handler to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted with the number of items in the cache, which would cause the event handler to behave differently.

DONE.
