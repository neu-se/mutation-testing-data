  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isNodeJS` variable is used to check if the current environment is Node.js, and if so, it throws the error synchronously to interrupt flushing. By negating the condition, the error is no longer thrown synchronously, and the code continues to execute asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isNodeJS` variable is used to check if the current environment is Node.js, and if not, it sets the `window` object as the global object. By checking if the `window` object is undefined, the code would always set the `window` object as the global object, even if the current environment is not Node.js.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `
