  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the `point` object as the second argument to `calculateDistance`, which is not the same as using `point` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the `point` object as the second argument to `calculateDistance`, which is not the same as using `point` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude - point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude and latitude of the `point` object, which is not the same as using `point` itself.

DONE.
