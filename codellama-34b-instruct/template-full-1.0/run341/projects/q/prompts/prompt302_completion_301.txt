  Welcome to the world of mutation testing! In this exercise, you'll be applying mutation testing to the provided code snippet to identify potential weaknesses in the test suite.

To perform mutation testing, you'll need to make small, intentional changes to the code and observe how the tests respond. If the tests don't fail after you make a change, it may indicate that the tests are not effective or that the code is buggy.

Let's get started! Replace the PLACEHOLDER in the code with the following code fragments and analyze how the tests respond:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the values of `x` and `y` are identical. If the tests don't fail with this change, it could indicate that the tests are not checking for value equality, which could be a problem.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y === z
```
This would result in different behavior because it would
