  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for null or undefined values in the timezone variable, whereas the original code fragment only checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the length of the timezone variable, whereas the original code fragment only checks for falsy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.isValid()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the validity of the timezone variable, whereas the original code fragment only checks for falsy values.

DONE.
