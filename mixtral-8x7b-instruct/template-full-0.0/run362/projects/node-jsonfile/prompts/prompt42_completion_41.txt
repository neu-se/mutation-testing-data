 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned string will be multiplied by 1, which will not affect the original behavior but is unnecessary and may indicate a lack of understanding of the `stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict' + stringify
