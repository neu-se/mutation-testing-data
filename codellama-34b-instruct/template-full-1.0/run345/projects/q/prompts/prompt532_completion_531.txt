  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value)["spread"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the "spread" property on the Q promise rather than calling the spread method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the Q promise instead of using the value as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would spread the value as-is rather than using it as an argument in the Q promise chain.

DONE.
