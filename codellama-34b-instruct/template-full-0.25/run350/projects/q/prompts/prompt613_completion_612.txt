  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the property `key` to `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior of getting the property `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the property `key`, which is different from the original behavior of getting the property `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would post the value `undefined` to the property `key`, which is different from the original behavior of getting the property `key`.

DONE.
