  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while the new code fragment `null` is a constant value that is not a function and does not take any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while the new code fragment `undefined` is a constant value that is not a function and does not take any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `end` and `stream`, while the new code fragment `function() {}` is a function that takes no arguments and does not return any value.

DONE.
