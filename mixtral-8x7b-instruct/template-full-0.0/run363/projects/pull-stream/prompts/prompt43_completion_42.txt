 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ref` array, so any modifications to the original `ref` array will not affect the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...ref]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as `ref`, so any modifications to the original `ref` array will not affect the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign([], ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the same elements as `ref`, so any modifications to the original `ref` array will not affect the returned value.

DONE.
