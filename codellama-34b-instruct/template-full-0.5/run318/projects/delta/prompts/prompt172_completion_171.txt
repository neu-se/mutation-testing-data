  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `other` delta's operations instead of the `this` delta's operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over both the `this` and `other` delta's operations, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the maximum length of the `this` and `other` delta's operations, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
