  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` property is not defined on the `generator` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` property is not defined on the `generator` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`. Additionally, the `arg` parameter is passed twice, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg, arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` property is not defined on the `generator` object, so the code would throw a `TypeError`. Additionally, the `arg` parameter is passed three times, which would cause an error.

DONE.
