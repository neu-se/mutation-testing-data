  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path, rather than a boolean value indicating whether the policy allows the given action on the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `matches` method of the policy with the given path and query context, rather than simply returning the result of the `matches` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `match` method of the policy with the given path and query context, rather than simply returning the result of the `match` method.

DONE.
