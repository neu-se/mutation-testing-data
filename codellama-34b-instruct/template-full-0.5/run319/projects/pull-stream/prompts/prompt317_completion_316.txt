  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `ended` as an argument, which is not the same as calling it with `null` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with both `null` and `data` as arguments, which is not the same as calling it with only `ended` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with both `null` arguments, which is not the same as calling it with `ended` and `data` as in the original code.

DONE.
