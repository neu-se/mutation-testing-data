Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always call `cb(end)` regardless of the value of `end`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when the stream ends.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the callback `cb(end)` from being called when the stream ends, which could lead to the consumer of the stream not being notified of the end of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to call `cb(end)` with `null`, which may not be a valid value for the `end` parameter and could lead to confusion or errors in the handling of the stream's end condition.

DONE.
