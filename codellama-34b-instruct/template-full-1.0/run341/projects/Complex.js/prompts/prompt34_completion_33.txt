  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` is the real part of the complex number, whereas `_b` is the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a + _b` is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, whereas `_b` is only the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * _b` is double the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `_b` is the imaginary part.

DONE.
