  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects a non-null object as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause it to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects a defined object as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause it to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects a non-zero value as its first argument, and passing `0` would cause it to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
