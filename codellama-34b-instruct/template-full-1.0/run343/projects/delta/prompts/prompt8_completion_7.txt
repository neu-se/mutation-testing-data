  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this one checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this one checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] == 'some value'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is not null, while this one checks if it is a specific value.

DONE.
