  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator of the values in the map, while the `keys()` method returns an iterator of the keys in the map. In this case, the `keys()` method would return an iterator of the URLs, while the `values()` method would return an iterator of the parsed URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator of the key-value pairs in the map, while the `values()` method returns an iterator of the values in the map. In this case, the `entries()` method would return an iterator of the URL-parsed URL pairs, while the `values()` method would return an iterator of the parsed URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.forEach()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach()` method applies a function to each element in
