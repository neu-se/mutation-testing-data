  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive a null value as its first argument, instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive an undefined value as its first argument, instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive a NaN value as its first argument, which is different from the expected value.

DONE.
