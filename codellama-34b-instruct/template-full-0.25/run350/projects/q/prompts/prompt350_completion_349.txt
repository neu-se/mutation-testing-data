  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `self` is an object that contains the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)` creates a new function that is bound to `self`, whereas `self` is an object that contains the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.call(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch.call(self)` calls the `promiseDispatch` method on `self`, whereas `self` is an object that contains the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
