  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array_slice` function to create a new array with the same elements as the original array, but with the first element removed. The buggy code fragment would instead use the `array_slice` function to create a new array with the same elements as the original array, but with the first element removed, and then use the `array_reduce` function to reduce the new array to a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array_reduce` function to reduce the `messages` array to a single value, but with the first element removed. The buggy code fragment would instead use the `array_reduce` function to reduce the `messages` array to a single value, but with the first element removed, and then use the `array_slice` function to create a new array with the same elements as the original array, but with the first element removed.
