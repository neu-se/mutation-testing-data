  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'head'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract links from the HTML head section, which may contain important information such as CSS and JavaScript files, rather than the main content of the page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').next().attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the href attribute of the next sibling element of each anchor tag, rather than the href attribute of the anchor tag itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').not('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude anchor tags with a base class from the extraction, potentially omitting important links.

DONE.
