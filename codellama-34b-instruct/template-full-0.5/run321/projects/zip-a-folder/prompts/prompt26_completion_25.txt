  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `archiverOptions` is `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || {gzip: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always include the `gzip` option, whereas the original code fragment would only include it if `archiverOptions` was not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format, archiverOptions || {zlib: {level: 9}}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always include the `zlib` option with a compression level of 9, whereas the original code fragment would only include it if `archiverOptions` was not `undefined`.

DONE.
