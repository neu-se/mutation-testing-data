Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function with the resolved value instead of passing the error, which would lead to incorrect handling of errors in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string message as the error instead of the actual error object, which could lead to confusion and improper error handling in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` with `null` for both the error and the value, which would mislead the caller into thinking that the operation was successful when it actually failed.

DONE.
