 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * parseFloat(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it always multiplies the real part by 1, whereas the original code fragment uses the `parseFloat` function to convert the string to a number. This change would cause incorrect results for strings that do not represent a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(c) ? 0 : parseFloat(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns 0 instead of `NaN` when the input string is not a valid number. This change would cause incorrect results when the input is not a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(parseFloat(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas the original code fragment
