  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes the element at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes the element at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the array, whereas `splice()` only removes the element at a specific index.

DONE.
