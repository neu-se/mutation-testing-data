  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes an op to the delta, while the replaced code fragment pushes null, which would not affect the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes an op to the delta, while the replaced code fragment pushes the delete property of the otherOp, which would not affect the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes an op to the delta, while the replaced code fragment pushes the retain property of the otherOp, which would not affect the delta.

DONE.
