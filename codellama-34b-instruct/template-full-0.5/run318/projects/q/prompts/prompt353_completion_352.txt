  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called with an exception object, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called with a different error object, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called with any argument, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
