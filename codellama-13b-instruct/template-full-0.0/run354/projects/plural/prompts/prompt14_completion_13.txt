  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the number 1 instead of the original code fragment, which was 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "0" instead of the original code fragment, which was 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return undefined instead of the original code fragment, which was 0.

DONE.
