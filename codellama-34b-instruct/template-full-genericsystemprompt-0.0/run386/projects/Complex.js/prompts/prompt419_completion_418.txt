  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while the new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is NaN.

DONE.
