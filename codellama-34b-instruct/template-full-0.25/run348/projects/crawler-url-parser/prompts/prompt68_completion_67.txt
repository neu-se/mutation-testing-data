  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with only one argument, which is not the intended behavior of the code. The `parse` function is supposed to take two arguments, the current URL and the base URL, and this change would cause it to only take one argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the same arguments as the original code, but in a different order. This change would not affect the behavior of the code, but it could potentially cause confusion or errors if the function is not designed to handle the arguments in this order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(sourceUrl, baseUrl, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with an additional argument, which is not
