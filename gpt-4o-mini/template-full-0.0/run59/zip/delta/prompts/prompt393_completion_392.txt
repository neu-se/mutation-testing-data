Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to always return one operation, potentially skipping over relevant operations that should be processed, leading to incorrect transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, which means the same operation could be processed multiple times, causing unexpected results in the transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` effectively does nothing and returns an empty operation, which could disrupt the expected flow of operations and lead to incorrect handling of the transformation.

DONE.
