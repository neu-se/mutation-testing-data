  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a method that calls a function with a given "this" value and arguments provided as an array. In this case, the function being called is "pull", but the "this" value is null, which may not be what the developers intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because "this" is a keyword that refers to the current execution context, which may not be the same as the "this" value in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(read, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because "read" is a variable that may have a different value than "this" in the original code.

DONE.
