Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.open
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.open` is an asynchronous method, whereas `this.openSync` is a synchronous method, so replacing it would change the method's behavior from blocking to non-blocking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.openSync.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.openSync.bind(null)` would change the context of `this` within the `openSync` method, potentially leading to errors if the method relies on the correct context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.openSync(filename, 'w')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code opens the file in write mode ('w') instead of read mode ('r'), which could lead to different file access and modification behavior.

DONE.
