  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeNodeResolver` method immediately, causing the function to return `undefined`, which would not be a correct implementation of the `resolve` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `makeNodeResolver` method on the Q object, which does not exist. This would cause an error when the `nmfapply` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `resolve` function as a callback to `setTimeout` instead of a node-style callback. This would cause an error when the `setTimeout` callback is executed.

DONE.
