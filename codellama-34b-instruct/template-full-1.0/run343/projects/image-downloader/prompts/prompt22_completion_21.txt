  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.relative` returns a path relative to the current working directory, whereas `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` joins multiple path components together, whereas `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.normalize(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.normalize` normalizes a path, whereas `path.resolve` returns an absolute path.

DONE.
