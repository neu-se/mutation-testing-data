  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj + {}` is a different object than `obj`, and would cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj[0]` is a different value than `obj`, and would cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` is a different string than `obj`, and would cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error.

DONE.
