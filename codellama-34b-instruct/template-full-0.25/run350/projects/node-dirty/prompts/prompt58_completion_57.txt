  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called immediately, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted immediately, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

DONE.
