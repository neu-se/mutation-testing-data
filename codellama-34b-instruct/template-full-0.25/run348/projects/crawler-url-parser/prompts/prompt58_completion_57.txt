  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the `if` statement would execute the code inside the block if the condition was true. By replacing it with `false`, the `if` statement would not execute the code inside the block, even if the condition is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the `if` statement would execute the code inside the block if the condition was true. By replacing it with `null`, the `if` statement would not execute the code inside the block, even if the condition is true, because `null` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the `if` statement would execute the code inside the block if the condition was true. By replacing it with
