  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.forEach((key, val) => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.forEach()` would iterate over each entry in the map, passing the key and value as arguments to the callback function, whereas the original code fragment `const [key, val] of this._data` would only iterate over the keys of the map and pass the key and value as separate variables to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().forEach(key => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` would return an iterator over the keys of the map, and `forEach()` would iterate over each key, passing the key as an argument to the callback function, whereas the original code fragment `const [key, val] of this._data` would only iterate over the keys of the map and pass the key and value as separate variables to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
