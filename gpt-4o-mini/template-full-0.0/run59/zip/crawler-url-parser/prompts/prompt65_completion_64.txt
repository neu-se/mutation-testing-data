Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host = parsedUrl.hostname;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the property being assigned to `ret.host` from the parsed URL's host (which includes the port) to just the hostname (which excludes the port), potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host = parsedUrl.host + 'extra';
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the host, which would make the host value invalid and could lead to incorrect URL resolution or parsing errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the host to `null`, which would cause any subsequent logic that relies on a valid host to fail or behave incorrectly, potentially leading to null reference errors or incorrect URL classifications.

DONE.
