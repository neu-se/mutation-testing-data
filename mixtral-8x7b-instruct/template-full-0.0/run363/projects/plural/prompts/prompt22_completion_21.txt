```
/nuclei|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fung[uo]s|cactus/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now checks for the presence of "fungo" or "fungu" instead of
