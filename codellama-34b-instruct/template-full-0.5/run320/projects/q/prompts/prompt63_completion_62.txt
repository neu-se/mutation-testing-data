  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, which is different from `window` in most cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object and does not have a `flush` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object and does not have a `flush` method.

DONE.
