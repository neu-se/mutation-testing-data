  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` checks if the key is present in the map, while `get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` returns an iterable of the values in the map, while `get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` returns an iterable of the key-value pairs in the map, while `get` retrieves the value associated with the key.

DONE.
