  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise object, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null value, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise.

DONE.
