  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCodePoint(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCodePoint()` expects a number representing a Unicode code point, while `key` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid key in a Map object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Symbol()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol()` creates a unique symbol value, which is not a key in the `_data` map.

DONE.
