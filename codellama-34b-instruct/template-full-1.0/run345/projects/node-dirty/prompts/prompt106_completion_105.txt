  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key` is always the same as `key` in the object `row`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"undefined"` is a string, while `row.val` is an object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid object value, while `row.val` is an object value.

DONE.
