  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the second-to-last op in the delta's ops array with the new op, rather than the last op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the first op in the delta's ops array with the new op, rather than the last op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the last op in the delta's ops array with the first op, rather than the last op with the new op.

DONE.
