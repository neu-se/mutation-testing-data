  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the link text, instead of the entire text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL of the link, instead of the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find("a").text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the text of the first link found in the element, instead of the text of the element itself.

DONE.
