Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "Error occurred"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the rejection reason to the next handler, it returns a string message, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a string instead of being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function() { throw new Error("Custom error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error instead of passing the original rejection reason, which would lead to a different error being propagated through the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with `null` instead of passing the rejection reason, effectively ignoring the rejection and treating it as a successful resolution.

DONE.
