Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Promise was rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the promise to be rejected with a specific error message instead of resolving it, which changes the expected outcome of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the resolved value by adding 1 to it, which could lead to unexpected results if the original value is not a number or if the intention was to return the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a `null` value instead of the result of `_fulfilled(value)`, which could lead to loss of the intended value and affect subsequent promise handlers.

DONE.
