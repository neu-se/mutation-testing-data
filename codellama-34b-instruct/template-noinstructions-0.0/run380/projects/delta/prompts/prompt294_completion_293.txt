  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first element of the iterator, potentially causing the loop to miss important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the previous element of the iterator, potentially causing the loop to repeat operations or skip over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over every other element of the iterator, potentially causing the loop to miss important operations or repeat operations.

DONE.
