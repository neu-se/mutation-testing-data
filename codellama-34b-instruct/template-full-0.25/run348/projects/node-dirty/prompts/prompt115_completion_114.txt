  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of an array, while `size` is a property of a map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the size of the map plus one, which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the size of the map multiplied by two, which would be incorrect.

DONE.
