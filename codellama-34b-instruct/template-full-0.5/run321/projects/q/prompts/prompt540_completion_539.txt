  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

DONE.
