  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `reject` function to be called with the `resolve` function as its first argument, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because only the `resolve` function is being called, and the `reject` function is not being called at all. This would likely cause the promise to never be rejected, even if an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is being called with no arguments, which would likely result in an error.

DONE.
