  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `cb`, potentially causing the `if` statement to be evaluated as `false` when it should be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would change the value of `cb`, potentially causing the `if` statement to be evaluated as `true` when it should be `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=>` would change the type of `cb` from a callback function to an arrow function, potentially causing the `if` statement to be evaluated differently.

DONE.
