Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(object).done(fulfilled, rejected, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the given object instead of resolving it, leading to a different handling of fulfilled and rejected states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(fulfilled, rejected, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves or rejects based on the original promise's state, but it would not call the `done` method, which is intended to handle unhandled rejections differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally(fulfilled);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the `fulfilled` callback regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected, which is not the intended behavior of the `done` method that should handle both states distinctly.

DONE.
