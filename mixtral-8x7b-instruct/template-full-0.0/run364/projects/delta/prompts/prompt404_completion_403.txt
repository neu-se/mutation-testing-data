 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler.transform` method would receive `null` as the third argument, which might cause a `TypeError` or unexpected behavior if the method is not prepared to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler.transform` method would receive an empty object as the third argument, which might cause a different execution path or unexpected behavior if the method is not prepared to handle empty objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `handler.transform` method would receive an array as the third argument, which is not the expected type (an object with a single property containing an array). This would likely cause a `TypeError` or unexpected behavior in the `handler.transform` method.

DONE.
