 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the array instead of the last one, affecting the order of data loaded from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new array, discarding the modifications made to the `arr` variable, and the `forEach` loop will not process any elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all key-value pairs from the internal `_data` object, discarding any previously loaded data and affecting the further operation of the class.

DONE.
