  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` always returns a fulfilled promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` always returns a rejected promise with a value of `undefined`, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise object.

DONE.
