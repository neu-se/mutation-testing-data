  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the value of `b` to calculate the logarithm, while replacing it with 0 would cause the logarithm to always be 0, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b === 0) ? 1 : b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not handle the case where `b` is 0, while this replacement would cause the logarithm to be 1 in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (b === 0) {
  return new Complex(Math.atan2(1, a), 0);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not have an explicit check for `b` being 0, while this replacement would cause the function to return a different value in that case.

DONE.
