Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of `point1` instead of `point2`, leading to an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude of `point2`, which would skew the distance calculation by artificially increasing the latitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude of `point2` by 2, which would distort the distance calculation by using an incorrect longitude value.

DONE.
