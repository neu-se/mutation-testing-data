  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that is called with the `end` and `data` arguments, but the original code fragment only calls `cb` with the `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with the `data` and `end` arguments in the opposite order than in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with an extra `end` argument, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
