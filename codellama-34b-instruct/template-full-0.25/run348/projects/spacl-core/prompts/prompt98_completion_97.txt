  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"name"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "name" instead of the actual name of the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the uppercase version of the policy name, which may not match the actual name of the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the reverse of the policy name, which may not match the actual name of the policy.

DONE.
