  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.push()` will add a new element to the end of the array, whereas `ref.unshift()` will add a new element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.splice()` will add or remove elements from the array, whereas `ref.unshift()` will only add a new element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift()` will remove the first element from the array, whereas `ref.unshift()` will only add a new element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
