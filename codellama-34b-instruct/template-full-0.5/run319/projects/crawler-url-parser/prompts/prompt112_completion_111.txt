  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null`, which would cause the `for` loop to exit immediately without iterating over any elements in the `urlMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `undefined`, which would cause the `for` loop to exit immediately without iterating over any elements in the `urlMap` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a specific URL, which would cause the `for` loop to iterate over all elements in the `urlMap` object that have a matching URL.

DONE.
