  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the property is undefined, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || object[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the property is defined or undefined, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the property is null, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
