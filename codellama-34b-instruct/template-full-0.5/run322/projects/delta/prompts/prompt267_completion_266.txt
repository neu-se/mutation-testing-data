  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes an element from a Delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to a Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that keeps an element in a Delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to a Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that combines two Deltas, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to a Delta.

DONE.
