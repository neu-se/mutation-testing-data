  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while `cb(false)` would return `false` in the same scenario.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while `cb(array[i])` would return the value of the array element at index `i` in the same scenario.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(array[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while `console.log(array[i])` would log the value of the array element at index `i` to the console without returning anything.
