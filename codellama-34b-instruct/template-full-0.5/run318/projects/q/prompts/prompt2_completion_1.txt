  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bootsrap"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bootsrap" is a string, whereas "bootstrap" is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because 1 is a number, whereas "bootstrap" is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a null value, whereas "bootstrap" is a function.

DONE.
