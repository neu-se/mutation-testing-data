Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) || isNodeFrame(line) || !line
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses logical OR instead of AND, meaning that it will include lines that are internal frames or node frames, as well as empty lines, which would not be filtered out by the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the check for `isNodeFrame(line)`, allowing internal frames to be included in the desired lines even if they are node frames, which the original code intended to exclude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to include only node frames and exclude internal frames, which is the opposite of the original intent to filter out both types of frames.

DONE.
