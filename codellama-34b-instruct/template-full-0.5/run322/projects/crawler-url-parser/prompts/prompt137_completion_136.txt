  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` character to split the URL path, while the new code uses the `\` character. This would cause the code to handle URLs differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` character to split the URL path, while the new code does not use any character to split the URL path. This would cause the code to handle URLs differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `/` character to split the URL path, while the new code uses the `/` character to split the URL path. This would cause the code to handle URLs differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
