Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used to encode a URI, whereas the original code used `decodeURI` to decode a URI, resulting in opposite operations being performed on the `normalizedUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape
```
This would result in different behavior because `unescape` is already being used earlier in the `normalizeUrl` function, but in this case, it would be used without the `decodeURI` function, potentially leading to different handling of special characters in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(url) { return url; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function simply returns the original `normalizedUrl` without any decoding or encoding, potentially leading to issues with special characters or encoding in the URL.

DONE.
