  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b*2` is a different expression than `b`, which would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different argument and therefore return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a-b` is a different expression than `b`, which would cause the `logHypot` function to receive a different argument and therefore return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a+b` is a different expression than `b`, which would cause the `atan2` function to receive a different argument and therefore return a different value.

DONE.
