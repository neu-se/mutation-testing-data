  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` has not been defined, but this replacement checks if it has been defined. If it has been defined, the code will enter the `else` block and throw a `ReturnValue` exception, even if the generator has not yet reached its final iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `StopIteration` has a specific type, but this replacement checks if it has a different type. If `StopIteration` has a different type, for example, if it is a string, the code will enter the `else` block and throw a `ReturnValue` exception, even if the generator has not yet reached its final iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "object"
```
This would result in different
