  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `progress` is an optional callback function that handles progress notifications. By removing it from the code, the promise will no longer receive progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, void
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is a shortcut for `function (){}` in JavaScript, which means that the `progress` callback will be set to a function that does nothing. This could cause the promise to receive progress updates, but the updates will be discarded without doing anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, ProgressTracker
```
This would result in different behavior because `ProgressTracker` is a hypothetical class that logs progress updates. By replacing `progress` with `ProgressTracker`, the promise will receive progress updates and log them to the console.

DONE.
