  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This code fragment will return the substring of `targetFilePath` starting from the second character, which may cause the `access` method to fail if the file path is not valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This code fragment will return the uppercase version of `targetFilePath`, which may cause the `access` method to fail if the file path is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/')[0]
```
This code fragment will return the first part of `targetFilePath` split by the `/` character, which may cause the `access` method to fail if the file path is not valid.

DONE.
