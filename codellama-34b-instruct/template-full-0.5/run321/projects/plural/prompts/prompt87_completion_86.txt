  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the word "person" specifically, while this new code fragment would match any word that ends in "people".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the word "person" specifically, while this new code fragment would match any word that ends in "peoples".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'human'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the word "person" specifically, while this new code fragment would match any word that ends in "human".

DONE.
