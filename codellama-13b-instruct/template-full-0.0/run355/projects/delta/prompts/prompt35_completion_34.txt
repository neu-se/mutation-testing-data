  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow `b` to be a non-object value, while the modified code fragment would only allow `b` to be a non-object value if it is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow `b` to be a non-object value, while the modified code fragment would only allow `b` to be null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow `b` to be a non-object value, while the modified code fragment would only allow `b` to be undefined.

DONE.
