 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isFinite(this['re']*10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part multiplied by 10 is finite, instead of checking if both the real and imaginary parts are finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is equal to 1, instead of checking if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] + this['im']*1i
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new complex number with the real part and the product of the imaginary part and the imaginary unit, instead of returning a boolean value indicating whether the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
