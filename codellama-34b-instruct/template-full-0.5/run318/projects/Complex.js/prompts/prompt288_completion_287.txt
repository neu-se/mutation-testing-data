  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `a`, causing the `cos` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator will add 1 to the value of `a`, causing the `cos` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator will multiply the value of `a` by 2, causing the `cos` function to return a different value.

DONE.
