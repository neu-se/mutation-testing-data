  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isInfinite`, so the resulting behavior would be the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
