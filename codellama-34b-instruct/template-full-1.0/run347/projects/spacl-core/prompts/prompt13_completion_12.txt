  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[^/]|:\/|/:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches if the path contains a colon, followed by a forward slash, or if the path ends with a colon. The proposed replacement would match if the path contains a colon, followed by anything but a forward slash, or if the path ends with a colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:./|:\/|/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches if the path contains a colon, followed by a forward slash, or if the path ends with a colon. The proposed replacement would match if the path contains a colon, followed by any character, or if the path ends with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches if the path contains a colon, followed by a forward slash, or
