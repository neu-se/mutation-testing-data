  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because a negative value is an invalid argument for the `slice` method, and would return an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` as an argument would cause the `dict()` method to throw an error, as it expects a number or a string as input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because using a zero as an argument would cause the `slice` method to return the entire string, instead of just the requested character.

DONE.
