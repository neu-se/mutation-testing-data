  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return `0` instead of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the string `"0"` instead of a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return `null` instead of a boolean value.

DONE.
