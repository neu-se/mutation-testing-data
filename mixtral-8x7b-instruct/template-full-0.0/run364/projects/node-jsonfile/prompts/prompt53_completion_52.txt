 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `replacer` is `undefined`, it will throw a `TypeError` in the original code, while the mutated code would use the default value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `replacer` is a number (0 in this case), the original code would use the identity function as the replacer, while the mutated code would replace the value with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because when `replacer` is a function, the original code would use the provided function as the replacer, while the mutated code would replace the value with an empty object due to the use of the `null` literal.

DONE.
