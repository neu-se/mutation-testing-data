  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which will invert the truthiness of the `mapper` variable. In the original code, the `mapper` variable is a function, so it will always be truthy and the `!` operator will always return `false`. In the mutated code, the `!` operator will return `true` if `mapper` is a falsy value, which could cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
