  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp.insert` property is a string, while the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the `nextOp` object is expected to be an object in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp.retain` property is a number, while the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the `nextOp` object is expected to be an object in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextOp.attributes` property is an object, while the original code fragment `nextOp` is an object. This could cause issues if the `nextOp` object is expected to be an object in the rest of the code.
