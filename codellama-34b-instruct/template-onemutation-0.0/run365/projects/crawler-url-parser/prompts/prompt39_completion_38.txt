  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'ftp:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for the "ftp" protocol, which is not included in the original code fragment.

DONE.
