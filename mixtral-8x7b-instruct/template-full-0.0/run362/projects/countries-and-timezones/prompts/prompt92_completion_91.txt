 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison between a string and a number would always be false, even if the countryId is a valid non-zero number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the getCountry function would return null immediately, without checking if the country is already in the countries object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries['0']
