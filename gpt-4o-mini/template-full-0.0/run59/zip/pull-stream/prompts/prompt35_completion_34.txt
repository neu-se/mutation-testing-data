Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the second argument to the first argument, potentially altering the intended order of arguments passed to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value of the second argument by adding 1 to it, which could lead to unexpected results if the second argument is not a number or if the addition changes the logic of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the second argument with `undefined`, which could cause errors or unexpected behavior when the `pull` function attempts to use this value in its logic.

DONE.
