  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method is called on a reversed array, which would cause the concatenated stack traces to be in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method is called on the first element of the array (the zeroth stack), which would be a different stack trace than the concatenated stacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the join method is called on the last element of the array (the last stack), which would be a different stack trace than the concatenated stacks.

DONE.
