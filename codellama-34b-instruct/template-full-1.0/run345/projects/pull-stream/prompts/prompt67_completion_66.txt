  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 end > true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `end` is greater than `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `end` is equal to `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end < true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `end` is less than `true`, even if `end` is `false`.

DONE.
