  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise is not the same as a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill([value])
```
This would result in different behavior because fulfilling a promise with an array containing the resolution value is not the same as fulfilling it with the resolution value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving a promise with the rejection of another promise is not the same as resolving it with the fulfillment of that promise.

DONE.
