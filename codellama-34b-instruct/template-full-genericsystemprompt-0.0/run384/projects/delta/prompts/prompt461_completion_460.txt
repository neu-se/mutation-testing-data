  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the current op in the rest of the ops, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the next op in the rest of the ops, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 3))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the next two ops in the rest of the ops, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
