  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code checks if both the complex number and the divisor are zero, resulting in a different output for the specific test case where both are zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if one of the two numbers is infinite, while the new code checks if both are infinite, resulting in a different output for the specific test case where both are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.NAN()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns NaN if one of the two numbers is not a complex number, while the new code always returns NaN, resulting in a different output for any test case where one of the numbers is not a complex number
