  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which has a different range and output than `cos`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is the sine function, which has a different range and output than `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is the tangent function, which has a different range and output than `cos`.

DONE.
