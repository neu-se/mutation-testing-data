  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `self` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `this` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Q` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
