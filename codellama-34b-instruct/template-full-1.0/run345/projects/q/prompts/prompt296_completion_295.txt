  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y)` is a different promise than `Q(x)`, and may not have the same resolution or rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x + y)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x + y)` is a different promise than `Q(x)`, and may not have the same resolution or rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(reject(y))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(reject(y))` is a rejected promise, whereas `Q(x)` may be resolved or rejected depending on the implementation.

DONE.
