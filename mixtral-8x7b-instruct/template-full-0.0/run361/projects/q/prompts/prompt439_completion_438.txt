 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` check in `isPromise` function would return `false` for `null` values, causing the function to return `value` instead of inspecting the state of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would not be called on the promise, and the state would not be checked. As a result, the function would always return a promise, even if it's fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` check in `isPromise` function would return `false` for functions, causing the function to return `value` instead of inspecting the state of a promise.

DONE.
