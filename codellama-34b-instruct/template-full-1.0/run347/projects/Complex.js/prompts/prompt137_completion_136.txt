  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method checks whether the complex number is infinite, and the PLACEHOLDER is not a valid argument for this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method checks whether the complex number is infinite, and the PLACEHOLDER is not a valid argument for this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite()` method checks whether the complex number is infinite, and the PLACEHOLDER is not a valid argument for this method.

DONE.
