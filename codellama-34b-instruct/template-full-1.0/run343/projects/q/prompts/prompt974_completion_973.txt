  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `nmapply` method would return `null` instead of the expected value from the `object` passed as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `nmapply` method would return an empty object instead of the expected value from the `object` passed as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `nmapply` method would return the string "hello" instead of the expected value from the `object` passed as the first argument.

DONE.
