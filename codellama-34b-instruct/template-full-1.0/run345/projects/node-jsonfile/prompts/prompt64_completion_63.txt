  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the content would be converted to an ASCII string instead of a UTF-8 string. This could cause issues if the content contains non-ASCII characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latin1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the content would be converted to a Latin-1 string instead of a UTF-8 string. This could cause issues if the content contains characters that are not present in the Latin-1 character set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the content would be returned as-is without any conversion. This could cause issues if the content is expected to be a string in a specific encoding.

DONE.
