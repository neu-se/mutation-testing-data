  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `abort` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment always calls `cb`, while this new code fragment only calls `cb` if `abort` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment always calls `cb`, while this new code fragment only calls `cb` if `abort` is truthy.

DONE.
