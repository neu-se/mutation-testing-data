  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `void 0`, does not throw an error and instead returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `void 0`, does not return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    return value + 1;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `void 0`, does not modify the value passed to the function.

DONE.
