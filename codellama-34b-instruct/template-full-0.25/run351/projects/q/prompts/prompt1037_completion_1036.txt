  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(function () { return { head: null, tail: null }; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns an object with `head` and `tail` properties, while this new code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns an object with `head` and `tail` properties set to `null`. This change would cause the `put` method to always resolve with `null` values for `head` and `tail`, which would likely cause the `get` method to fail when it tries to access the `head` and `tail` properties of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(function () { return { head: undefined, tail: undefined }; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a function that returns an object with `head` and `tail` properties, while this new code fragment creates a deferred
