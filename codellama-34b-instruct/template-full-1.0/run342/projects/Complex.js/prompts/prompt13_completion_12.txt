  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + x > b || x > b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra addition operations would cause the conditional expression to evaluate to a different value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - x < b || x < b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra subtraction operations would cause the conditional expression to evaluate to a different value in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b < x || x < a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra addition operations would cause the conditional expression to evaluate to a different value in some cases.

DONE.
