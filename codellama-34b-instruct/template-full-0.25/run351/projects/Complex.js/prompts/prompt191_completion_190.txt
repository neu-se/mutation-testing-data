  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a function that calculates the sine of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a function that calculates the cosine of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

DONE.
