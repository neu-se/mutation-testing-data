Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to be true when the operation type is 'delete', potentially altering the flow of logic and leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the operation from the `otherIter` iterator instead of the current `iter`, which could lead to incorrect decisions based on the state of the other iterator rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check for 'retain' operations instead of 'insert', which could lead to skipping over valid insert operations and affecting the overall logic of the function.

DONE.
