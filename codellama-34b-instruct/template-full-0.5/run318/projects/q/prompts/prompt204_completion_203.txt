  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getLineNumber` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lineNumber` variable is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a reference error.

DONE.
