  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + sourceUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate any preceding value to the `sourceUrl` string, potentially altering its value and causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!sourceUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the truthiness of `sourceUrl`, potentially altering the outcome of any conditional statements that depend on its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, potentially causing any conditional statements that depend on `sourceUrl` to fail.

DONE.
