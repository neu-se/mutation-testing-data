  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `NaN` when both operands are infinite, instead of `Infinity` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Infinity` when either operand is infinite, instead of `NaN` as in the original code.
