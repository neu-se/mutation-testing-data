  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(Promise.rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.rejected` is a rejected promise, which would cause the `when` function to immediately reject the promise, rather than waiting for the promise to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(Promise.resolved)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolved` is a resolved promise, which would cause the `when` function to immediately resolve the promise, rather than waiting for the promise to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(Promise.pending)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.pending` is a pending promise, which would cause the `when` function to wait for the promise to settle, rather than immediately resolving or rejecting the promise.

DONE.
