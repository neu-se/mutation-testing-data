 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and the `fapply` method will throw an error when it tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that immediately resolves the promise, bypassing the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function does not have the same behavior as `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which is used to create a Node.js-style callback for the `fapply` method.

DONE.
