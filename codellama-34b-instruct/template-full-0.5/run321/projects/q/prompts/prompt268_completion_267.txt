  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially have a different effect on the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially have a different effect on the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially have a different effect on the program's behavior.

DONE.
