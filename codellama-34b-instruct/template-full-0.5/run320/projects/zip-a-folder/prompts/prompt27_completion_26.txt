  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called twice, once for the `close` event and once for the `error` event, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('finish', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called only once, when the `finish` event is emitted, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected only once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('end', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called only once, when the `end` event is emitted, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected only once.

DONE.
