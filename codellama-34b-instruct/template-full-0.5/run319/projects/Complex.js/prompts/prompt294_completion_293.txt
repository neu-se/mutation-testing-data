  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not the same as the `b` variable, and the `cosh` function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value for the input `b + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value for the input `-b`.

DONE.
