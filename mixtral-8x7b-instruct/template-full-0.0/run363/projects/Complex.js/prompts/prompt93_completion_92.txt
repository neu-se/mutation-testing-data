 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
plus + minus > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 1 instead of checking if it equals 0 or if `c` is NaN. This could lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers when there are no sign changes in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(c) || c === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if `c` is NaN or an empty string. This could lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers when the input string contains whitespace characters but no actual numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
c.trim() === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if `c` is an empty string after removing leading and trailing whitespace. This could lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers when the
