  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<CODE>Object.entries</CODE>
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key/value pairs for an object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<CODE>Object.values</CODE>
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values for an object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<CODE>Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty</CODE>
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if a property exists on an object without checking its prototype chain, while `Object.keys` returns an array of keys including inherited properties.

DONE.
