 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called without passing any arguments, which would immediately reset the unhandled rejections array and stop tracking unhandled rejections. This could potentially hide unhandled rejections in the system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resetUnhandledRejections(true)
