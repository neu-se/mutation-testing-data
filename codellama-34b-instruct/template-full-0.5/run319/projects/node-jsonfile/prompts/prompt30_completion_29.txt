  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `obj` variable is truthy, but replacing it with `null` would cause the check to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `obj` variable is an object, but replacing it with an empty object would cause the check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `obj` variable is an object, but replacing it with an empty array would cause the check to fail.

DONE.
