  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, but `!Array.isArray(point.coordinates)` would check if `point.coordinates` is not an array, which would be the opposite of the original check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `point.coordinates.length !== 2` would check if the length of the `coordinates` array is not equal to 2, which would be the opposite of the original check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `point.coordinates.length < 2` would check if the length of the `coordinates` array is less than 2, which would be the opposite of the original check.
