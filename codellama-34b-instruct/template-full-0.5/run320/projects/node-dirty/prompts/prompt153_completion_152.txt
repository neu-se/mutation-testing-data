  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called twice in a row, which could cause the write stream to become clogged and prevent data from being written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called immediately after the `cork` method, which could cause the write stream to become unclogged and allow data to be written to the file, even if the `cork` method was not previously called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called with the `true` argument, which would cause the write stream to be uncorked and allow data to be written to the file, even if the `cork` method was not previously called
