  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the resulting delta to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the resulting delta to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the resulting delta to be different from the original.

DONE.
