  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used 0 as the `substr` starting position, which is the length of the word "thesis" minus 2. Using 1 instead would result in a different substring being returned, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `w.length - 2` as the `substr` starting position, which is the length of the word "thesis" minus 2. Using `w.length - 3` instead would result in a different substring being returned, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `w.length - 2` as the `substr` starting position, which is the length of the word "thesis" minus 2. Using 4 instead would result in a different
