  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the value is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'undefined', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `'undefined'` is a string, and it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the value is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, cb, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `cb`, and it would cause the `set` method to behave differently when the value is `undefined`.

DONE.
