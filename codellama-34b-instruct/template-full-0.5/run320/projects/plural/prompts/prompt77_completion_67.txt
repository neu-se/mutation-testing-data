  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a list of two elements, while the new code fragment is a single element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment has an extra element compared to the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die', 'dice', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment has a different order of elements compared to the original code fragment.

DONE.
