  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the sink value, which could cause the code to behave differently if the sink value is used elsewhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the sink value, which could cause the code to behave differently if the sink value is used elsewhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the sink value, which could cause the code to behave differently if the sink value is used elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
