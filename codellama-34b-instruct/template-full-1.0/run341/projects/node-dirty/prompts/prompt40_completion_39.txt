  Here are three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property of the `fn` object, rather than the value stored in the `_data` Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `key` property in the `_data` Map to `val`, rather than returning the value stored in the `_data` Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the total number of keys stored in the `_data` Map, rather than the value stored in the `_data` Map at the given key.

DONE.
