  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode <= 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the `statusCode` property is only checked to be greater than 200, whereas the original code fragment checks for equality. This change could cause the promise to resolve when it should have rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode & 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&` operator is a bitwise AND operator, which takes the bitwise AND of the operands. This change could cause the promise to reject when it should have resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode + 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will return a new value that is the sum of the two operands. This change could cause the promise to resolve when it should have rejected.

DONE.
