 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for non-equality instead of equality, which would cause the following block of code to execute when `newOp.retain` is a number, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain !== 'number' || typeof lastOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for non-equality or if `lastOp.retain` is not a number, which would cause the following block of code to execute when either `newOp.retain` or `lastOp.retain` is not a number, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' && typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.retain`
