  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Failed to load database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits `load` event with 0 as argument, while this code would emit an `error` event with a custom error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits `load` event with 0 as argument, while this code would emit `load` event with -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits `load` event with 0 as argument, while this code would emit `load` event without any arguments.

DONE.
