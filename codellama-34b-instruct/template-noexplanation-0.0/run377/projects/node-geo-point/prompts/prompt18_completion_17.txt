  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This code fragment will check if the `object` variable is falsy, which means it will return `true` if `object` is `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, or an empty string. This change will cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `object` argument is not an object, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This code fragment will check if the `object` variable has a property called `latitude`. If it does not, it will return `true`, which will cause the `fromObject` method to throw a `TypeError`. This change will ensure that the `object` argument has the required `latitude` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
