  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only sets the `seen[key]` property to `true` if the `invert` parameter is `false`. By setting it to `true` unconditionally, we are effectively inverting the behavior of the `seen` object, which could cause the `filter` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only sets the `seen[key]` property to `false` if the `invert` parameter is `true`. By setting it to `false` unconditionally, we are effectively inverting the behavior of the `seen` object, which could cause the `filter` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = !invert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only sets the `seen[
