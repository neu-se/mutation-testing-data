  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern `/^\/\/\//` matches a url that starts with three forward slashes instead of two, which is likely to be an invalid url.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:https?):\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern `/^(?:https?):\/\/` matches a url that starts with either "http" or "https" instead of just "http", which could lead to different behavior in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the pattern `/^https?:\/\//` matches a url that starts with either "http" or "https" instead of just "http", which could lead to different behavior in certain cases.

DONE.
