  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve(value)` is a function that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject(reason)` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

DONE.
