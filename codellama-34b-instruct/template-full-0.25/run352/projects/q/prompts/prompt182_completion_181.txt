  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace before the first ":" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack trace, which may not include the file name and line number information.

DONE.
