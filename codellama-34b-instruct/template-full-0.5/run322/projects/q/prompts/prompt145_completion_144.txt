  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return the original stack trace without filtering it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to the string "foo", which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return the filtered stack trace with the string "foo" appended to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to an empty array, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return an empty string.

DONE.
