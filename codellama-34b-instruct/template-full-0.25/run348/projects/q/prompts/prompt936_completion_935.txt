  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. In contrast, `arguments.length` returns the number of arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. In contrast, `arguments[0]` returns the first argument passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. In contrast, `arguments[1]` returns the second argument passed to a function.

DONE.
