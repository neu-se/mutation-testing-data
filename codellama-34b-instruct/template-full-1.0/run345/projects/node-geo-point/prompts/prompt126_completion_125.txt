  The code snippet provided is a class definition for a `GeoPoint` object, which contains various methods for calculating distances, bearings, and destinations based on geographical coordinates. The PLACEHOLDER in the `calculateDistance` method refers to the `distance` parameter, which is a numerical value representing the distance between two points.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.radius * this.distance
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.radius` is not defined in the class, and `this.distance` is a numerical value representing the distance between two points, while `radius` is a numerical value representing the radius of the Earth.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.distance * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a numerical value representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, while `this.distance` is a numerical value representing the distance between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
