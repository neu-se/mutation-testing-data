  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that takes a promise as an argument, and `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise. By calling `reject` with the value, it would create a new rejected promise and pass it to `become`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that takes a value as an argument and returns a resolved promise with that value. By calling `fulfill` with the value, it would create a new resolved promise with the given value and pass it to `become`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a function
