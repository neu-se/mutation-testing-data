Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the arguments by excluding the first element, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise dispatch operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the arguments, potentially altering the expected input for the promise dispatch operation and affecting how the promise resolves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on the first argument, which may not be a number, leading to unexpected results or errors during promise dispatch.

DONE.
