  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` are different variables, and using `point2Rad` in place of `point1Rad` would cause the calculation to use the wrong values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` would cause the calculation to use the sum of the two values, rather than the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(point1Rad, point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2()` takes two arguments, and using it in place of `point1Rad` would cause the calculation to use the arctangent of the two values, rather than the product.

DONE.
