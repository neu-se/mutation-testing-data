  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(["new illness"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the "illnesses" array, while this modified code fragment also includes an additional array element "new illness".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the "illnesses" array, while this modified code fragment only includes the last element of the "illnesses" array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the "illnesses" array, while this modified code fragment only includes the first element of the "illnesses" array.

DONE.
