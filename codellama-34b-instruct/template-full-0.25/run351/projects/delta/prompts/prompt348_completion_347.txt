  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` variables are not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.opData, this.baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.opData` and `this.baseOpData` are not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opData` and `baseOpData` variables are not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
