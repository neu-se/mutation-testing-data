  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null does not have a 'nmapply' method, so it would throw a TypeError when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when('hello')
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.when('hello') returns a promise that resolves with the value 'hello' immediately, instead of returning a promise that resolves with the value of the 'nmapply' method on Q.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ nmapply: function() { return Q; } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new object with a property 'nmapply' that returns a promise that resolves with the value 'hello'.

DONE.
