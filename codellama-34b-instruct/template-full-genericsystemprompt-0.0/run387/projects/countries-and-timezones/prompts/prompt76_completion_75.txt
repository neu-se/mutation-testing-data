  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `timezone` is an object with a `name` property, regardless of the value of `timezone`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name === 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `timezone` is an object with a `name` property that is equal to `'UTC'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name.includes('UTC')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `timezone` is an object with a `name` property that includes the string `'UTC'`.

DONE.
