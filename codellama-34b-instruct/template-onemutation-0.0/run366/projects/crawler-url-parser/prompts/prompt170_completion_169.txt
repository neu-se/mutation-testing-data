  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains of the two URLs are equal, while the new code fragment checks if they are not equal. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
