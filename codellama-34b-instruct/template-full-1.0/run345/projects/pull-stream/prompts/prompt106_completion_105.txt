  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and replacing it with `null` would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and replacing it with a string would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
