 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the `options` object to the `request` function, causing unexpected behavior in the `request` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object to the `request` function if `options` is falsy, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `options` object, and any modifications to the `options` object after this line would not affect the copy passed to the `request` function.

DONE.
