  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word "person," resulting in the plural form "people." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "'person'" would result in the same output for both the singular and plural forms, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word "person," resulting in the plural form "persons." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "'persons'" would result in the same output for both the singular and plural forms, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word "person," resulting in the plural form "peoples."
