  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `StopIteration` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `StopIteration` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration === "undefined" && "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `"undefined"`, even if `StopIteration` is defined.

DONE.
