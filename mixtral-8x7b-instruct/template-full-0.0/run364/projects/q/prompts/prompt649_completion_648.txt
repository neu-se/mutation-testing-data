 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, {args: args}]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` variable is now wrapped in an object, which changes how it will be processed by the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"Post", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "post" is now capitalized, which could cause issues if the `Promise.prototype.dispatch` method is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"post", [name, Q(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is now wrapped in a promise, which could cause issues if the `post` method is not designed to handle promises as arguments.

DONE.
