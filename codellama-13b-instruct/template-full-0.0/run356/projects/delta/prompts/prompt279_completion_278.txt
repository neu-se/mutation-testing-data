  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the length of the `Op` object, while the new code fragment returns the length of the `Op` object's `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the length of the `Op` object, while the new code fragment returns the `insert` property of the `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the length of the `Op` object, while the new code fragment returns the `retain` property of the `Op` object.

DONE.
