  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is not being called on the `tester` object, which is likely to cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    return cb(err);
  }
  cb(null, result);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with a callback function, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    return cb(err);
  }
  cb(null, result);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with a callback function, which is not the same as the original code
