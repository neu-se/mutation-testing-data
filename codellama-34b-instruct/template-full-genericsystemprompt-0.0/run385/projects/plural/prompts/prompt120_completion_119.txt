  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word as is, while this new code fragment returns the input word in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word as is, while this new code fragment returns the length of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word as is, while this new code fragment returns the input word with its characters reversed.

DONE.
