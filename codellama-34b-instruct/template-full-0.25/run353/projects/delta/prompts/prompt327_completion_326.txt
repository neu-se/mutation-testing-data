  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a new element into the inverted Delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the inverted Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes an element from the inverted Delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the inverted Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the current element in the inverted Delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the inverted Delta.

DONE.
