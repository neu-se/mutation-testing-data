  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisIter.peekText === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current op is a text insertion operation, whereas the original code checks if the current op is any type of insertion operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisIter.peekOp === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current op is a non-insertion operation, whereas the original code checks if the current op is any type of operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisIter.peekOp === 'object' && thisIter.peekOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current op is a non-insertion operation and has an `insert` property, whereas the original code checks if the current op is any type of operation.

DONE.
