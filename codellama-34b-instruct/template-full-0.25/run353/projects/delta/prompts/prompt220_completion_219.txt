  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `insert` property, while this replacement checks for its absence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `insert` property, while this replacement checks for its absence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the `insert` property, while this replacement checks for its absence.

DONE.
