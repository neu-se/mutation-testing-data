  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country === null` checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country !== null` checks if it is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country.length === 0` checks if the `country` variable is an empty string or an empty array.

DONE.
