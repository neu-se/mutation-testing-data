  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is a number, whereas this new code fragment checks if it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === ' ' || isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is a digit, whereas this new code fragment checks if it is not a digit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment parses the next token as a float, whereas this new code fragment multiplies the next token by -1 and then parses it as a float.

DONE.
