  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would not accept any arguments, whereas the original function definition takes an argument `definition`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object would not have a `definition` property, whereas the original function definition uses `definition` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would not be a valid function definition, whereas the original function definition is a function expression.

DONE.
