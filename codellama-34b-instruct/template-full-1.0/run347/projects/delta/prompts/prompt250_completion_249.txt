  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() ? otherIter.peekLength() : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of 0 when the other iter has no next elements, whereas the original code would only return a length of 0 when the its peek type is not an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() || thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of 1 when either of the iterators has no next elements, whereas the original code would only return a length of 1 when its peek type is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() ? 0 : otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of 0 when the other iter has no next elements, whereas the original code would only return a length of 0
