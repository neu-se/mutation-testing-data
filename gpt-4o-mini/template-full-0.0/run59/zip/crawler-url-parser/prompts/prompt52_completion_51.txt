Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original `currentUrlStr` instead of the parsed URL, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution and parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve the base URL using only the host of the parsed URL, ignoring the full URL structure and potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + '/dummy'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append a static string to the base URL, which could lead to incorrect URL resolution and parsing, as it would not reflect the actual intended URL structure.

DONE.
