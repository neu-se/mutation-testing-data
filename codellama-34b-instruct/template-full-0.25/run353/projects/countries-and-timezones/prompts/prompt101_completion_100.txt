  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the resulting behavior would be the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is checking for strict equality, so the resulting behavior would be different from the original code that used the `!` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).includes(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the given key is present in the object, so the resulting behavior would be different from the original code that used the `!` operator.

DONE.
