 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.next - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation's index reduced by 1, instead of the actual next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the ops array directly, bypassing the logic for handling the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current operation instead of the next operation, as the original `this.next` method does.

DONE.
