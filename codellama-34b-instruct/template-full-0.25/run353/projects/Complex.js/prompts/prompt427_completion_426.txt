  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by zero, which would throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by a negative number, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing by a different number, which would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
