  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `x` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `y` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z` variable is not defined in the scope of the function, and would cause a reference error.

DONE.
