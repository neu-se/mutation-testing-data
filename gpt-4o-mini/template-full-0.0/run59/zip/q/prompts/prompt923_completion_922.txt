Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs.slice(0, -1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `nodeArgs` array by removing the last element (the callback), which would prevent the correct callback from being invoked, leading to unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs.concat("unexpected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an unexpected string "unexpected" to the `nodeArgs`, which could cause the callback to receive incorrect arguments, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the `nodeArgs` array before passing it to the callback, which could lead to incorrect argument order being passed to the original function, resulting in unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
