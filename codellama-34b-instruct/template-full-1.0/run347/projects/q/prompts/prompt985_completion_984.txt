  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this.undefinedMethod
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefinedMethod` is not a valid method of the `Promise` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this.dispatch(Promise.resolve())
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects a thenable as its first argument, but `Promise.resolve()` is an immediately resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
this.dispatch(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects a thenable as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a thenable.

DONE.
