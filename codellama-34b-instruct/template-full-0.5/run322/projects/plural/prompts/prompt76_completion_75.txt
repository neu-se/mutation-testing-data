  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which is a valid plural form, but `'die'` is not a valid plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which is a valid singular form, but `'dice'` is not a valid singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which is a valid singular form, but `'dies'` is not a valid singular form.

DONE.
