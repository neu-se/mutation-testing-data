  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value.then(function () {
  return Q(<PLACEHOLDER>);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is being called on the `exception.value` promise, which could potentially alter its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value.catch(function () {
  return Q(<PLACEHOLDER>);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is being called on the `exception.value` promise, which could potentially alter its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.value.finally(function () {
  return Q(<PLACEHOLDER>);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is being called on the `exception.value` promise, which could potentially alter its behavior.

DONE.
