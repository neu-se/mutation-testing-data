 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider an `Op` object with a `delete` property that has a falsy value (e.g., `0`, `''`, `null`, or `false`) as having a length of `0`. The original code considers only `null` and `undefined` as not being a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.delete === 'number' && op.delete !== null
