  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('\n').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the path specification is no longer split on '/' characters, but on newline characters. This would cause the matcher to match a different set of paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the path specification is now split on '/' characters, but the slice function is called with a different starting index (2 instead of 1). This would cause the matcher to match a different set of paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('*').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the path specification is now split on '*' characters, but the matcher is still expecting a '/' character. This would cause the matcher to match a different set of paths.

DONE.
