  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it has a different signature. The `fromCallback` function expects a callback function as its first argument, while the `fromPromise` function expects a promise as its first argument.

DONE.
