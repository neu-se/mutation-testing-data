  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This change will cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with a delay of 1 millisecond instead of 0, which may cause the `flush` function to be called later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, -1
```
This change will cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with a delay of -1 millisecond, which is not a valid value and may cause the `flush` function to be called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, null
```
This change will cause the `setTimeout` function to be called with a delay of `null`, which is not a valid value and may cause the `flush` function to be called immediately.

DONE.
