 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.hasOwnProperty('r')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'r' property exists in the timezone object instead of accessing its value. This change would cause the `result.deprecated` property to be set to `true` only when the 'r' property exists in the timezone object, rather than depending on the value of 'r'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.r || false
