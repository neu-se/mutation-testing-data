  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` parameter is not the same as the `key` parameter, which is used to identify the property to be deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to set the value of a property, rather than delete it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` parameter is not necessary for the `delete` method, and it would cause an error if the `value` parameter is not provided.

DONE.
