  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves or rejects when any of the promises in the array have resolved or rejected.

DONE.
