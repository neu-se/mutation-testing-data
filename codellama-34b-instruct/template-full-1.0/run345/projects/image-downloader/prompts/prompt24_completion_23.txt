  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first character of the `dest` property instead of the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `dest` property to an integer instead of using its string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decode the `dest` property using `decodeURIComponent` instead of using its original string value.

DONE.
