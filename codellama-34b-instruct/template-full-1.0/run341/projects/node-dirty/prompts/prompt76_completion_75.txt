  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative value would be returned as the size of the database, even if the database has no entries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid value for the size of a database, and it would cause the `set` method to fail when trying to add a new entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is not a valid value for the size of a database, and it would cause the `set` method to fail when trying to add a new entry.

DONE.
