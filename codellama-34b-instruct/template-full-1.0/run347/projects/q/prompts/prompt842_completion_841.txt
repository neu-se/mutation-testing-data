  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise, while `Q.timeout` always returns a rejected promise with a custom error message or Error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a promise for the fulfillment of the given promise, while `Q.timeout` always returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` always returns a rejected promise with a given error, while `Q.timeout` may or may not return a rejected promise depending on the value of the `error` argument.

DONE.
