  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"progress" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single variable reference, while this option concatenates the string "progress" with the number 1, resulting in a new string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single variable reference, while this option calls the toString() method on the progress variable, resulting in a new string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single variable reference, while this option references the length property of the progress variable, resulting in a new number value.

DONE.
