  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether the `country` object does not exist, whereas this code is checking whether the `length` property of the `country` object is not defined. If the `country` object exists but does not have a `length` property, this code would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether the `country` object does not exist, whereas this code is checking whether the `length` property of the `country` object is zero. If the `country` object exists but has a `length` property with a value of zero, this code would behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether the `country` object does not exist, whereas this code is checking whether the `size` property of the `country`
