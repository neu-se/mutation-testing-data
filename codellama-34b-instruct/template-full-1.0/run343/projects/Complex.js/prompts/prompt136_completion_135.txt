  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` will flip the boolean value of `this['isInfinite']`, making it `false` when it was originally `true`, and vice versa. This would cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` line to be skipped when the original code would have executed it, making the function produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isZero']` is a different property and method than `this['isInfinite']`. Even if the input is infinite, it would still return the complex number that is constructed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would no longer be able to determine if the input is infinite or not. The program would always return the complex number that is constructed.

DONE.
