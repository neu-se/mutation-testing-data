  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when attempting to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is defined for the `Complex` class, but it expects a `Complex` object as its argument, not a `Number`. The code would throw a `TypeError` when attempting to call the method with a `Number` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is defined for the `Complex` class, but it expects a `Complex` object as its argument, not a `Number`. The code would throw a `TypeError` when attempting
