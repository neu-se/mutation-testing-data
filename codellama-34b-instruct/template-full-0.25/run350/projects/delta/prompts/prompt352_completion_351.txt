  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op instead of the base op, which could cause the transformation to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the attributes of the base op, which could cause the transformation to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the attributes of the base op and use the attributes of the other op, which could cause the transformation to produce a different result.

DONE.
