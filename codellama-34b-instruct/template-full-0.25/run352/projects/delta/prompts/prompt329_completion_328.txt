  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `op.attributes`, even if `op.retain` is falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `op.attributes` if `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain ? op.attributes : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `op.attributes` if `op.retain` is truthy, and `null` if `op.retain` is falsey.

DONE.
