  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with the `this` context set to `null`, whereas the original code uses the `progressed` function directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `progressed` function with `null` as the `this` context, whereas the original code uses the `progressed` function directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `progressed` function with `null` as the `this` context and an empty argument list, whereas the original code uses the `progressed` function directly.

DONE.
