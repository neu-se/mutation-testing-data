  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { deferred.reject(error) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different message than deferred.makeNodeResolver().

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error, result) { deferred.resolve(error || result) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with either the error or result from the callback, rather than just calling deferred.makeNodeResolver.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error, result) { deferred.reject(error ? error : result) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with either the error or result from the callback, rather than just calling deferred.makeNodeResolver.

DONE.
