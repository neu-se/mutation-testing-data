  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because "all" is a different method than "allSettled" and would return a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in the array are fulfilled, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with an array of states for the respective promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because "any" is a different method than "allSettled" and would return a promise that is fulfilled when any promise in the array is fulfilled, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with an array of states for the respective promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"none"
```
This would result in different behavior because "none" is not a valid method and would cause an error, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with an array of states for the respective promises.

DONE.
