  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more elements to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop if there are more elements to iterate over and the next element is not an insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() || iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop if there are more elements to iterate over or the next element is an insert operation.

DONE.
