  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when the `nodeArgs` array is passed to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when the `nodeArgs` array is passed to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be called instead of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which would not resolve the promise.

DONE.
