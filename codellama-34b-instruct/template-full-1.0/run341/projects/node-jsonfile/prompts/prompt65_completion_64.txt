  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice` expects an integer as the first argument, whereas `content.replace` expects a string or a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.charAt` returns a single character at a specified index, whereas `content.replace` replaces all occurrences of a string or regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.search` returns the index of the first occurrence of a string or regular expression, whereas `content.replace` replaces all occurrences of a string or regular expression.

DONE.
