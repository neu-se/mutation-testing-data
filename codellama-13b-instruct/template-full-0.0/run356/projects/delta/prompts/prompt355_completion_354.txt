  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while the buggy code fragment checks if the argument is a number and is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while the buggy code fragment checks if the argument is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the argument is a number, while the buggy code fragment checks if the argument is not null.

DONE.
