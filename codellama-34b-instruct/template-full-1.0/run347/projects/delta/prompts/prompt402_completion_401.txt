  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(thisData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now reversed, so the `embedType` would need to match the first key in `thisData` instead of `otherData`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be negated, so the `embedType` would need to not match the first key in `otherData` instead of matching it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because the check now uses the `include` method to see if `embedType` exists in the array of keys in `otherData`, instead of checking if it's equal to the first key.

DONE.
