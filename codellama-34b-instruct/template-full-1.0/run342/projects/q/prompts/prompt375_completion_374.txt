  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not being checked for inequality with `false`, which is a possibility in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not being checked for equality with `null`, which is a possibility in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not being checked for inequality with `false`, which is a possibility in the original code.

DONE.
