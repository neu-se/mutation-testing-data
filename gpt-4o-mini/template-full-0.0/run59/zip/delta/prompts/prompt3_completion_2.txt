Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` performs a shallow copy of the object `b`, meaning that nested objects will not be deeply cloned, potentially leading to unintended mutations if the nested objects are modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because directly assigning `b` without cloning means that any changes made to `attributes` will also affect `b`, as they will reference the same object in memory, leading to side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...b }
```
This would result in different behavior because using the spread operator creates a shallow copy of `b`, similar to `Object.assign`, which does not handle nested objects correctly, potentially causing issues if the nested properties are modified.

DONE.
