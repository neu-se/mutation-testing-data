Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would refer to the current execution context, which may not have the same properties as the `object` being passed, potentially leading to incorrect key retrieval.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` check to fail, as `null` does not have any properties, leading to an empty array being returned instead of the actual keys of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` check to fail, similar to using `null`, resulting in an empty array being returned instead of the actual keys of the object.

DONE.
