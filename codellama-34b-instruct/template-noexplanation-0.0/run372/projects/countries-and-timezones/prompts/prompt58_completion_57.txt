  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to memoize the timezone instead of the country, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the `getTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(timezone)
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to memoize the timezone instead of the country, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the `getTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(country)
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to memoize the country instead of the timezone, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the `getTimezone` function.

DONE.
