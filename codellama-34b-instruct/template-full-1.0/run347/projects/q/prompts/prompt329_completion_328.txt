  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (reject(new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y)));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always reject the promise with an error, regardless of whether the two values are the same or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (resolve(x));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always resolve the promise with the first value passed to it, regardless of whether the two values are the same or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (resolve(y));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always resolve the promise with the second value passed to it, regardless of whether the two values are the same or not.

DONE.
