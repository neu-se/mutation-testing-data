  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite, while `!isFinite` is the negation of that function, and would return `true` if the value is not finite. This would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `true`, even if the value is not finite, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinity` is a function that checks if a value is infinite, while `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite. This would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, even if the value is finite, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a function that checks if a value
