  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add an extra degree to the result of the `deg2rad` function, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the result of the `deg2rad` function, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract one degree from the result of the `deg2rad` function, which would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
