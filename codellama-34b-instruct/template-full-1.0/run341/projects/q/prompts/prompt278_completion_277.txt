  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise's progress listeners instead of resolving it.

DONE.
