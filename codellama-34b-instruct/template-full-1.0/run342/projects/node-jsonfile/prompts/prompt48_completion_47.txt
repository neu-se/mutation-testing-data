  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.test(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `str` variable as a string, while this code will try to call the `test` method of `str`, which is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test".concat(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `str` as a variable, while this code will concatenate the string "test" with the string value of `str`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `str` as a string, while this code will try to access the first character of `str` as an array.

DONE.
