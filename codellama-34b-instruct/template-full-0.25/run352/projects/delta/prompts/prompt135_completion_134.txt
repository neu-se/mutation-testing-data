  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peek` would return the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` would return a boolean indicating whether there are more operations in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peek` would return the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest` would return an array of the remaining operations in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peek` would return the next operation.

DONE.
