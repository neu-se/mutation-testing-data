Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to check for keys in `b` instead of `a`, potentially overwriting attributes from `b` that are not present in `a`, leading to loss of data that should have been preserved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, which means that the function would not add any attributes from `a` that are not present in `b`, effectively ignoring `a` entirely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to not iterate over any keys, meaning that no attributes from `a` would be added to `attributes`, resulting in a loss of any data that should have been merged from `a`.

DONE.
