  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of the array, rather than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array that is a concatenation of the original array and any additional arrays or values passed as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method returns a new array with each element transformed by the callback function, which in this case adds 1 to each element.

DONE.
