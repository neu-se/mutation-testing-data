  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the `reduce()` method applies a function to each element in the array and returns a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of the array passed as an argument, whereas the `reduce()` method applies a function to each element in the array and returns a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a new array by copying a portion of the original array, whereas the `reduce()` method applies a function to each element in the array and returns a single value.

DONE.
