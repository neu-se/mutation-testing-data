  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for a "#" symbol instead of an "@" symbol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for a "%" symbol instead of an "@" symbol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"^"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for a "^" symbol instead of an "@" symbol.

DONE.
