 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which would cause the `matches` method to always return `false` when checking for rule matches in the cloned policy, even if the path matches any rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule)
