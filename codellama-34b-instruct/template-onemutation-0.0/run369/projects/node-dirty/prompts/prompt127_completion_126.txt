  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty or if the write stream is waiting for a drain, while the new code fragment checks if the queue is not empty and the write stream is not waiting for a drain. This change would cause the `_flush` method to be called more frequently, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
