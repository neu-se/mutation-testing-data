 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use twice the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing the iteration to skip or repeat some operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
