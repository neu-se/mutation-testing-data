  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset < index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is not being incremented in the original code, so the loop would run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset > index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is not being incremented in the original code, so the loop would run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset !== index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is not being incremented in the original code, so the loop would run indefinitely.

DONE.
