  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retained the length of the current operation, while this version retains the length of the `thisOp` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retained the length of the current operation, while this version retains the length of the `otherOp` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retained the length of the current operation, while this version retains the sum of the lengths of the `thisOp` and `otherOp` operations.

DONE.
