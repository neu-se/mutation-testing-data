  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the first element of the array, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the last element of the array, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a random element from the array, rather than the first or last element.

DONE.
