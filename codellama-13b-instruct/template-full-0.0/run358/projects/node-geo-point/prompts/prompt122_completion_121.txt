  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the current object, while `this.latitude` refers to the `latitude` property of the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point` variable refers to a different object than the current object, and `point.latitude` refers to the `latitude` property of the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `this.latitude` and `point.latitude` refer to specific values.

DONE.
