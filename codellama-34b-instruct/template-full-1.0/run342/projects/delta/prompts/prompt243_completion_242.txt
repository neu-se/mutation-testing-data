  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `otherOp.delete` property, not its type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `otherOp.delete` property, not its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the existence of the `otherOp.delete` method, not its value.

DONE.
