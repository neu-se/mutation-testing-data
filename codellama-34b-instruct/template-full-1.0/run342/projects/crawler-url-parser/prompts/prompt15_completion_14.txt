  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#[^]/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character instead of just the slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the URL fragment and remove it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#^/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the start of the URL and remove it.

DONE.
