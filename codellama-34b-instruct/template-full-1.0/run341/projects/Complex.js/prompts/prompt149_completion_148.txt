  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the base or exponent is NaN, which is not the same as checking if they are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && z['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the base and exponent are both finite, which is not the same as checking if they are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0 || z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the base or exponent is zero, which is not the same as checking if they are infinite.

DONE.
