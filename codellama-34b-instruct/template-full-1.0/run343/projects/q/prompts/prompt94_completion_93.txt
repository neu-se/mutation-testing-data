  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop that would never enter the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop that would never enter the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (NaN) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop that would never enter the `if` statement.

DONE.
