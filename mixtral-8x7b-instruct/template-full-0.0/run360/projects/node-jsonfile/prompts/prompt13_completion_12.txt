 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operands for the conditional (ternary) operator, which may lead to unexpected behavior if `options.reviver` is falsy but not explicitly `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `undefined` as the second argument to `JSON.parse`, which may cause issues if the JSON string contains special values that require a custom reviver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `0` as the second argument to `JSON.parse`, which may cause issues if the JSON string contains special values that require a custom reviver function.

DONE.
