  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/y$|ch$|s$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'x' character is not matched in the first alternative, while it is in the original regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$|plural/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'plural' word is not matched in the original regex, while it is in this new regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|ice$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the 's' character is not matched in the third alternative, while it is in the original regex.

DONE.
