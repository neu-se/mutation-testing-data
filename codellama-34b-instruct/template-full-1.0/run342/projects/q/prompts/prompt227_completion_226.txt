  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(messages)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` returns true for a value that is not an array, whereas `messages` is a value that can be an array or a value that is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` is an integer that represents the number of elements in the array, whereas `messages` is a value that can be an array or a value that is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages.every(function (msg) { return msg !== q; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `every` method checks if every element in the array satisfies the provided testing function, whereas `messages` is a value that can be an array or a value that is not an array.

DONE.
