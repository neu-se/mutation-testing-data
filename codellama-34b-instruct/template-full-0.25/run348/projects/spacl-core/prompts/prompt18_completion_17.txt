  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of strings, but the `slice` method would return an array of numbers, which would cause the `reverse` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return a string, but the `reverse` method would return an array of strings, which would cause the `join` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of lowercase strings, but the `reverse` method would return an array of strings, which would cause the `map` method to fail.

DONE.
