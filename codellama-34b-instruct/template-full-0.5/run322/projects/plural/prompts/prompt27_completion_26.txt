  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this replacement subtracts 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this replacement adds 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this replacement multiplies the length by 2.

DONE.
