  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In this modified code, the two operands are concatenated using the `+` operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href - baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In this modified code, the two operands are subtracted using the `-` operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href * baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In this modified code, the two operands are multiplied using the `*` operator
