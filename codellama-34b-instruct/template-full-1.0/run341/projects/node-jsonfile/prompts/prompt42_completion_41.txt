  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Some random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because "Some random string" is a constant string and not the result of the `stringify` function, which is expected to return a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because 12345 is a number and not the result of the `stringify` function, which is expected to return a JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `stringify` in the original code fragment is a variable that is assigned to the result of `JSON.stringify(obj, options)`.

DONE.
