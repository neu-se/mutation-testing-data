  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pushes the callback to the list of callbacks if `cb` is truthy, while this modified code fragment pushes the callback regardless of whether `cb` is truthy or not.
