  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number and `op.attributes` is null, while the new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number and `op.attributes` is null, while the new code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number and `op.attributes` is not null. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null && op.attributes
