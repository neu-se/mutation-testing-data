  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.concat(other.slice(start));
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a new `Delta` object, whereas `concat()` returns a new `Delta` object that is the concatenation of the two input `Delta` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.compose(other.slice(start));
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose()` returns a new `Delta` object that represents the composition of the two input `Delta` objects, whereas `concat()` returns a new `Delta` object that is the concatenation of the two input `Delta` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.diff(other.slice(start));
```
This would result in different behavior because `diff()` returns a new `Delta` object that represents the difference between the two input `Delta` objects, whereas `concat()` returns a new `Delta` object that is the concatenation of the two input `
