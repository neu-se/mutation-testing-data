  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of the file, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the file, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\u0000/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the null character (0x00) from the beginning of the file, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
