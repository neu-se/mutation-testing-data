  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules.slice()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because slicing the `rules` array creates a shallow copy, which means that any changes made to the `rule` variable inside the loop would also affect the original `rules` array. In the original code, the `rule` variable is reassigned on each iteration of the loop, so any changes made to it would not affect the original `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of [...this.rules, null]) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator (`...`) creates a new array with the elements of `this.rules` and `null` appended to it. This means that the loop would iterate over the new array, which includes an extra `null` element at the end. In the original code, the loop only iterates over the `rules` array, so any changes made to it would not affect the loop.

Option 3: The PL
