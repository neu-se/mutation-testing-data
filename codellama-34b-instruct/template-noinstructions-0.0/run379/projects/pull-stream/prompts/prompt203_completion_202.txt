  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `map` function to never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the `end` variable, causing the `map` function to only be called if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the `end` variable, causing the `map` function to only be called if `end` is falsy.

DONE.
