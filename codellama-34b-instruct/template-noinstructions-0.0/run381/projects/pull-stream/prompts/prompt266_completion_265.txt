  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it could cause the function to behave differently when handling the `data` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `data`, and it could cause the function to behave differently when handling the `data` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to call itself recursively, potentially leading to a stack overflow.

DONE.
