Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the length of the operation, potentially causing the `retain` operation to process more characters than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly subtracts 1 from the length of the operation, which could lead to missing out on retaining the last character of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `retain` property of the operation instead of its length, which may not accurately reflect the number of characters to retain, especially if `retain` is undefined or null.

DONE.
