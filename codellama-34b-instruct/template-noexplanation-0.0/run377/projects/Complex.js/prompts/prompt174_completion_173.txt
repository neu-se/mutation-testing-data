  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === 0
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `===` operator instead of `==`. This is a more strict comparison that checks for both value and type equality, which can be useful in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This code fragment is the opposite of the original code fragment, and it checks if `d` is not equal to zero. This can be useful if the original code fragment is not working as expected and you want to check for the opposite condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This code fragment checks if `d` is greater than zero. This can be useful if you want to check if `d` is positive, and you don't care about its exact value.

DONE.
