  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing an empty function would cause the promise to resolve immediately without waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(error, result) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, and passing a function with two arguments would cause the promise to resolve with the result of the asynchronous operation, but the `error` argument would be ignored.

DONE.
