  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different operation than `op.retain`, and would cause the `retain` method to be called on a `delete` operation, which would have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different operation than `op.retain`, and would cause the `retain` method to be called on an `insert` operation, which would have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain(0)` would cause the `retain` method to be called with a length of 0, which would have unintended consequences.

DONE.
