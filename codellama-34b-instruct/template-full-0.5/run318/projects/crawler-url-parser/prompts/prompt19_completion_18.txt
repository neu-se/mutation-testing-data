  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the base URL, which could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with "http://", which could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the base URL, which could cause issues with the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
