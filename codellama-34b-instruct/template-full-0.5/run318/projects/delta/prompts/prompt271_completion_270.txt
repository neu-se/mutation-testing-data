  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the next operation is a delete, while the modified code fragment would skip over delete operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the next operation is an insert, while the modified code fragment would skip over insert operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the next operation is a retain, while the modified code fragment would skip over retain operations.

DONE.
