  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` is a method and should not be used as a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` is a method that needs to be called on the correct context, not invoked directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the next op, and we want to check if it's an insert.

DONE.
