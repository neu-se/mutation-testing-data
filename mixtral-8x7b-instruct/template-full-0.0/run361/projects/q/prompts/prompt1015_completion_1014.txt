 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately calls the function, instead of passing the function reference. This means that the `nodeArgs.push` call would receive the result of the function, rather than a function to be called within the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the intended function reference with a null value. The `nodeArgs.push` call would then receive null, which would likely cause an error in the `dispatch` method or within the called function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
