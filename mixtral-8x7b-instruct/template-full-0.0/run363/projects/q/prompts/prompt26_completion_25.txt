 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => task()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new arrow function, which may have different `this` binding or scope behavior compared to the original `task`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
task.apply(null, [])
