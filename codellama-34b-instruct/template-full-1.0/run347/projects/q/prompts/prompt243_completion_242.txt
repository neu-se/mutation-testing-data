  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` check would always fail if `resolvedPromise` is a promise, even if it is a fulfilled or rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` check would always pass if `resolvedPromise` is a falsy value (e.g., `0`, `false`, `undefined`, etc.), even if it is a fulfilled or rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is a fulfilled promise, and it would throw an error if `resolvedPromise` is a rejected promise or a non-promise value.

DONE.
