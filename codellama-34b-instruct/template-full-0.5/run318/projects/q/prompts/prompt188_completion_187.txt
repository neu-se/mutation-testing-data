  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the `attempt2` array, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `attempt2` array, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2.join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the elements of the `attempt2` array with an empty string, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
