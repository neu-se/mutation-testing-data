 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, while the original code simply references the arguments object. This could lead to different behavior in functions that modify the arguments object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of the enumerable properties of the arguments object, while the original code simply references the arguments object. This could lead to different behavior in functions that expect an array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.callee
