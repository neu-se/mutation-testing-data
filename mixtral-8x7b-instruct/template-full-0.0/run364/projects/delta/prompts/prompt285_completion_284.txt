 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf function would always return -1, as the second argument is treated as the position to start the search from, and Infinity is not a valid position in a string. This would cause the code to always treat the newline as if it were not found, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the eachLine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf function would always return -1, as the second argument is treated as the position to start the search from, and -1 is not a valid position in a string. This would cause the code to always treat the newline as if it were not found, potentially causing incorrect behavior in the eachLine function.
