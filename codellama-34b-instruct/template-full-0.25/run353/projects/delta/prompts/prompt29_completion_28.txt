  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.inverted
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.inverted` is a different object than `base`, and the `invert` function is not called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert()` is a different function than `base.invert`, and the `invert` function is not called on `base`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(base)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(base)` is a different function than `base.invert`, and the `invert` function is called on `base` with a different argument.

DONE.
