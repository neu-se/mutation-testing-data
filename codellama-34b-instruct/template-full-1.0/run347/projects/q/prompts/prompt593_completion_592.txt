  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.method
```
This would result in different behavior because `method` calls the function as a method of the specified object, while `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

DONE.
