  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
