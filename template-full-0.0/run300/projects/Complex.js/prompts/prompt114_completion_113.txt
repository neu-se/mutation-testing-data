  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the `parse` function is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the `parse` function is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the `parse` function is.

DONE.
