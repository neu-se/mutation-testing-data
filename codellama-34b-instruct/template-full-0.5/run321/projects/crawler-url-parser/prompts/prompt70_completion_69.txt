  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { ignoreWhitespace: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ignoreWhitespace` option would cause Cheerio to ignore whitespace characters in the HTML, which could affect the results of the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { lowerCaseTags: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `lowerCaseTags` option would cause Cheerio to convert all HTML tags to lowercase, which could affect the results of the `extract` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option would cause Cheerio to decode HTML entities, which could affect the results of the `extract` function.

DONE.
