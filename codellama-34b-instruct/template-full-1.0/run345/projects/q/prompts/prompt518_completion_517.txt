  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the returned promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the returned promise to be rejected with the rejection value `null` instead of the value held by `rejection`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.resolve` function would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the returned promise to be fulfilled with the value `null` instead of the value held by `rejection`.

DONE.
