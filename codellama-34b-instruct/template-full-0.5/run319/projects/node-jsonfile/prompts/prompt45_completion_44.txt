  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + obj, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string representation of `obj` with the string representation of `options`, rather than passing them as separate arguments to the `stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string representation of `obj` with the string representation of `options`, rather than passing them as separate arguments to the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string representation of `options` with the string representation of `1`, rather than passing them as separate arguments to the `stringify` function.

DONE.
