  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, whereas the `isInfinite` function checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is finite, whereas the `isInfinite` function checks if a value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property of the `Complex` object holds the imaginary part of the number, and checking if it is not equal to 0 will return a different result than checking if the number is infinite.

DONE.
