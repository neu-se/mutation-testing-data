Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `z` is infinite instead of checking if `this` is infinite, which could lead to incorrect results when adding two complex numbers where only one of them is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the case where `this` is zero as a valid condition for returning `Complex['NAN']`, which is not the intended logic for adding complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional condition that checks if `this` is zero while `z` is infinite, which could lead to unexpected results when adding complex numbers, potentially returning `Complex['NAN']` in cases that should not trigger that condition.

DONE.
