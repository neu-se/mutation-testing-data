  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to be used instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to use the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator instead of the type of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff()` function to use the length of the current operation in the `otherIter` iterator instead of the type of the current operation, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
