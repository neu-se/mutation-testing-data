  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which is a function. In the original code, `cb` is called as a function, but with the `!` operator, it is negated and becomes a boolean value. This change would cause the test to fail if it relies on the `cb` function being called.

DONE.
