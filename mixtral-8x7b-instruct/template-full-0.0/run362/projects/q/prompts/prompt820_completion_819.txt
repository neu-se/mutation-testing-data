 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would not have access to the `fulfilled`, `rejected`, and `progress` parameters, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would override the `fulfilled`, `rejected`, and `progress` parameters with the value `true`, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would interpret the `fulfilled`, `rejected`, and `progress` parameters as functions, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
