  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, which would prevent the `define` function from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& true` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, which would cause the `define` function to be called even if it is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === "function" && define.amd && typeof define.amd.define === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof define.amd.define === "function"` would check if the `define` function is defined on the `amd` object, which would cause the expression to evaluate to `false` if it is not defined.

DONE.
