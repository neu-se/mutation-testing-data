  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, rather than just the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().filter(x => x.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any values in the map that do not have a `url` property, rather than simply iterating over all the values.

DONE.
