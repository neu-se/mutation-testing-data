  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` parameter, which is an object, while the new code fragment is using the `null` constant, which is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` parameter, which is an object, while the new code fragment is using the `undefined` constant, which is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` parameter, which is an object, while the new code fragment is using the `0` constant, which is a primitive value.

DONE.
