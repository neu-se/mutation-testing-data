  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad = <PLACEHOLDER>(point2.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `point2.latitude` instead of `point1.latitude`, which could cause the calculation to be off by a significant amount.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radius = <PLACEHOLDER>(point1.longitude - point2.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `point1.longitude - point2.longitude` instead of `point1.longitude`, which could cause the calculation to be off by a significant amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const Ï†2 = deg2rad(<PLACEHOLDER>(point2.latitude));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `deg2rad` for `point2.latitude` instead of `point1.latitude`, which could cause the calculation to be off by
