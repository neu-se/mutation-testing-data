  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter would be passed as the first argument to `setTimeout`, which would cause the timeout to be cleared immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter would be passed as the second argument to `setTimeout`, which would cause the timeout to be cleared immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` parameter would be passed as the third argument to `setTimeout`, which would cause the timeout to be cleared immediately.

DONE.
