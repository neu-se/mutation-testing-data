  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the square root of the difference of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the square root of the difference of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
