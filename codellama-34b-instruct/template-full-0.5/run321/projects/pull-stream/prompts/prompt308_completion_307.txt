  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `test(data)` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy or `test(data)` is truthy.

DONE.
