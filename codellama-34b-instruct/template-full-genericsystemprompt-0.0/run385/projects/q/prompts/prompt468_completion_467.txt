  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"handledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong arguments, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
