  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromCallback` method takes a callback function as its second argument, while the `fromPromise` method returns a promise that resolves to the callback function's result. Using `fromCallback` instead of `fromPromise` would cause `readFile` to return a callback function instead of a promise, which would likely break any code that expects a promise to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
universalify.fromNodeCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `fromNodeCallback` is a function that creates a node-style callback function from a promise-based function. Using `fromNodeCallback` instead of `fromPromise` would cause `readFile` to return a node-style callback function instead of a promise, which would likely break any code that expects a promise to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
universalify.fromDenod
