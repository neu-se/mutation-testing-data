  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `err` argument as the first argument, while in the mutated code, `null` is passed as the first argument instead of `err`. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, for example, it may not handle errors correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `err` argument as the first argument, while in the mutated code, `undefined` is passed as the first argument instead of `err`. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, for example, it may not handle errors correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `err` argument as the first argument, while in the
