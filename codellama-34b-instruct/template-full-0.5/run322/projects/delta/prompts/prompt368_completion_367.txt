  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas the `peekType` property returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas the `peekType` property returns the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation in the iterator, whereas the `peekType` property returns the type of the current operation.

DONE.
