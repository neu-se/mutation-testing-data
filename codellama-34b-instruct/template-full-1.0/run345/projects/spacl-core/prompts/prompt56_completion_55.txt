  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.split()` splits the string into an array of characters, while `part.replace()` replaces a substring with a new string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(1)` removes the first character of the string, while `part.replace()` replaces a substring with a new string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `part[0]` returns the first character of the string, while `part.replace()` replaces a substring with a new string.

DONE.
