 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not check the current index against the length anymore, causing it to potentially access undefined array elements or even go into an infinite loop if `index` starts with a value greater than `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + 1 > length
