  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + "s"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add "s" to the end of the word, regardless of the word's pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(0, -1) + "es"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last character of the word and add "es" to the end, regardless of the word's pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 2) + "ies"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last two characters of the word and add "ies" to the end, regardless of the word's pluralization rules.

DONE.
