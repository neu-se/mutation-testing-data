 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would not inherit from `Promise.prototype`, and thus may not have access to methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, etc.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would inherit from an empty object, and thus may not have access to methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, etc.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would inherit from a function, and thus may not have access to methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, etc.

DONE.
