  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 hour to the offset, which could cause the resulting time string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset up to the nearest hour, which could cause the resulting time string to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset to the nearest hour, which could cause the resulting time string to be incorrect.

DONE.
