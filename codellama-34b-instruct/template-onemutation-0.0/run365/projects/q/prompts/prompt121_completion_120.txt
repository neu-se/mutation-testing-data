  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `in` operator to check if a property exists in an object, while the modified code fragment uses the assignment operator to assign a value to a variable. The `in` operator checks if a property exists in an object, while the assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

DONE.
