  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always throw an exception, whereas `thenResolve` will always return a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will always return a promise, whereas `thenResolve` will always return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function (value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will always return a promise, whereas `thenResolve` will always return a resolved promise.

DONE.
