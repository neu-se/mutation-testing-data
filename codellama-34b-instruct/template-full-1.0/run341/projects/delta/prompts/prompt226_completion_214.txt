  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to run indefinitely, as the length would never be greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
majorVersion > 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter a different branch of the if statement, potentially leading to different behavior depending on the implementation of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter a different branch of the if statement, potentially leading to different behavior depending on the implementation of the function.

DONE.
