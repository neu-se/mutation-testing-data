  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as `this` to the `fallback` function, which would likely cause the function to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as `this` to the `fallback` function, which would likely cause the function to fail to invoke the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() => {}` function would be passed as `this` to the `fallback` function, which would likely cause the function to fail to invoke the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
