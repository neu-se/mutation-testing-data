  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.filter(function(word) {return word === 'diabete'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would only return the word "diabete" instead of all the words in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.map(function(word) {return word.substring(0, 3) + 's'})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would only return the first three characters of each word + "s" instead of maintaining the original words with the "es" suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` function would only return the first two elements of the array instead of all the words.

DONE.
