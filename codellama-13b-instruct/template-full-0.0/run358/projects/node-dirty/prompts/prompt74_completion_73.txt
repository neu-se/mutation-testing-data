  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted immediately, without waiting for the file to be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be emitted if an empty line is encountered in the file, rather than being ignored.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be emitted if a corrupted row is encountered in the file, rather than being ignored.

DONE.
