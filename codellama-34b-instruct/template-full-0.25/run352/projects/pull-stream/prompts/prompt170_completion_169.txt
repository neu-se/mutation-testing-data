  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `cb(true)` when the array is empty, while this new code fragment returns `cb(false)` in the same situation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns `cb(null, array[i++])` when `i` is less than the length of the array, while this new code fragment returns it unconditionally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++] + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `array[i++]` without modifying it, while this new code fragment returns the value plus 1.

DONE.
