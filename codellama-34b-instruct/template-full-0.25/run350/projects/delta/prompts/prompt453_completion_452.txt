  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.offset === 0) {
  return this.ops.slice(this.index);
} else {
  return this.ops.slice(this.index + 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is 0, and if it is, it returns the entire array from the current index. However, if the offset is not 0, it returns the array from the current index plus 1. In this modified code, the offset is not taken into account, so the behavior would be different if the offset is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.offset === 0) {
  return this.ops.slice(this.index);
} else {
  return this.ops.slice(this.index - 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is 0, and if it is, it returns the entire array from the current index.
