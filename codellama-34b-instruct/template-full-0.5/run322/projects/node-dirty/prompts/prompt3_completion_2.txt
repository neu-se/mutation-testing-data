  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `val == null` would also match `null` values, whereas `val === undefined` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `val !== undefined` would match any value that is not `undefined`, whereas `val === undefined` would only match `undefined` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because `!val` would match any falsy value, whereas `val === undefined` would only match `undefined` values.

DONE.
