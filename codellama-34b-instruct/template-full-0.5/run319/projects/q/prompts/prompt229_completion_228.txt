  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, and `args[0]` would return the first element of the array, which may not be the same as the original `args` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` would return a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the same as the original `args` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` would return a new array that is a concatenation of the `args` array with any additional arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
