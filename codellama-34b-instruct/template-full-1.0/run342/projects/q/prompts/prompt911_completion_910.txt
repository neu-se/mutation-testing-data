  Option 1:
```
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that joins two arrays, while `+` is the array concatenation operator. In this case, `nodeArgs` is an array, so `baseArgs + nodeArgs` would produce a different result than `baseArgs.concat(nodeArgs)`.

Option 2:
```
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(nodeArgs.join())
```
This would result in different behavior because `join()` is a method that converts an array to a string, while `concat()` expects to be passed another array. In this case, `nodeArgs.join()` would produce a different result than `nodeArgs`.

Option 3:
```
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` only joins two arrays, while `baseArgs + nodeArgs` joins an array with a string. In this case, `baseArgs
