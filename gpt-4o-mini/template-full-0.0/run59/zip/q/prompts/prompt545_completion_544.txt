Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]();
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the generator function without passing the argument, which would lead to incorrect handling of the value being yielded or thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg, arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the argument twice to the generator function, which is not the intended use and could cause unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].call(this, arg);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` for the generator function call, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if the generator relies on its own context.

DONE.
