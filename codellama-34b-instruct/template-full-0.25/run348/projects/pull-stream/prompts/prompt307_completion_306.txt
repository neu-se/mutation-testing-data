  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment called `cb` with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment calls it with the wrong arguments, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, !data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment called `cb` with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment calls it with the wrong arguments, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment called `cb` with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment calls it with the
