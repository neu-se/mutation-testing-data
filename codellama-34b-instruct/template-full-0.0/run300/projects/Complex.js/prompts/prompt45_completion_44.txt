  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor.name` would return the name of the constructor function that created the object `a`, whereas `typeof a` would return the type of the object `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.toString()` would return a string representation of the object `a`, whereas `typeof a` would return the type of the object `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the object `a`, whereas `typeof a` would return the type of the object `a`.

DONE.
