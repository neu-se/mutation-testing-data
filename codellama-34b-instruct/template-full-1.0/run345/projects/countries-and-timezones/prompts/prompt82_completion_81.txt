  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated version of the country, whereas the original code fragment would return the current version if it exists, and the deprecated version if it does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getTimezone(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone corresponding to the country, whereas the original code fragment would return the country corresponding to the timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getTimezonesForCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the deprecated timezones for the country, whereas the original code fragment would return the current timezones for the country.

DONE.
