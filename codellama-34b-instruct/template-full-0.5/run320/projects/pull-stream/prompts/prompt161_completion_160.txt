  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` as the value, regardless of whether the `value` parameter is null or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `abort` as the first argument, regardless of whether the `value` parameter is null or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `value` parameter as the second argument, regardless of whether it is null or not.

DONE.
