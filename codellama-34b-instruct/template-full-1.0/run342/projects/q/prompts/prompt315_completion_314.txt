  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the if statement would be checking if the `descriptor[op]` property is undefined, rather than checking if the `fallback` function is undefined. If the `descriptor[op]` property is undefined, the `promiseDispatch` function would still be called, which could result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof descriptor[op] !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the if statement would be checking if the `descriptor[op]` property is not a function, rather than checking if the `fallback` function is undefined. If the `descriptor[op]` property is not a function, the `promiseDispatch` function would still be called, which could result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(descriptor[op], op)
```
