  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one element, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator over the other delta, potentially skipping over the next operation in the other delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null operation into the delta, which could cause issues when the delta is applied to a document.

DONE.
