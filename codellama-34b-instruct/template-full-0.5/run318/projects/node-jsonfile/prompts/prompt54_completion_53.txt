  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 for the `spaces` argument, regardless of the actual value passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 for the `spaces` argument, regardless of the actual value passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1 for the `spaces` argument, regardless of the actual value passed in.

DONE.
