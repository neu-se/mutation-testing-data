  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is not called in the mutated code, while the mutated code calls the `onAbort` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is not called in the mutated code, while the mutated code calls the `onAbort` function with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is not called in the mutated code, while the mutated code calls the `onAbort` function with an empty argument list.

DONE.
