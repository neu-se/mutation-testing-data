  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + λ1 * Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x)` calculates the longitude of the destination point using the arctangent of the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate, while the new code fragment `λ2 = λ1 + λ1 * Δλ` calculates the longitude of the destination point using the sum of the initial longitude and the difference in longitudes between the initial and destination points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + λ2 * Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x)` calculates the longitude of the destination point using the arctangent of the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate, while the new code fragment `λ2 = λ1 + λ2 *
