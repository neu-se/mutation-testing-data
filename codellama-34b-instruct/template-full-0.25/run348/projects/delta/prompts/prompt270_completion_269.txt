  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the `retain` method to be executed, whereas the original code fragment did not call `retain` with a non-zero argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the `delete` method to be executed, whereas the original code fragment did not call `delete` with a non-zero argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` would be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the `retain` method to be
