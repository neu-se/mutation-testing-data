  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `if` statement, causing the `else` block to be executed when the `if` condition is `true`, and the `if` block to be executed when the `if` condition is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is an instance of the `Function` constructor, which is not the same as checking if `stream` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `stream` is a function using the `typeof` operator, which is the same as the original code.

DONE.
