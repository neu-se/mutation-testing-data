  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a small imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a small imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a small imaginary part.

DONE.
