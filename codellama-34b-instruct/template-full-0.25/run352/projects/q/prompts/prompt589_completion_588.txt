  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `async` function immediately, rather than returning a function that can be called later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `async` function immediately and pass the result of `makeGenerator` as an argument, rather than passing the `makeGenerator` function itself as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () { return makeGenerator; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that returns the `makeGenerator` function, rather than returning the `makeGenerator` function directly.

DONE.
