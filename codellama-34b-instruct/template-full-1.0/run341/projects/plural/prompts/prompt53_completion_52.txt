  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.endsWith('oof')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith` method is checking for a substring match at the end of the word, while the original code fragment was checking for an exact match using `===`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toLowerCase() === 'dwarf' || w.toLowerCase() === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method is converting the word to lowercase before checking for a match, while the original code fragment was checking the word as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!/dwarf|roof/.test(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is checking for the presence of the substrings 'dwarf' or 'roof' in the word, while the original code fragment was checking for an exact match using `===`.

DONE.
