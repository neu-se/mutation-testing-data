  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would be called immediately, instead of waiting for all promises to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would be called immediately, instead of waiting for all promises to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` would be called immediately, instead of waiting for all promises to be resolved.

DONE.
