  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. If the code is changed to `Promise.resolve`, the function will return a resolved promise with the error message as its value, rather than a rejected promise with the error message as its reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise with a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise with a different error message than the original code.

DONE.
