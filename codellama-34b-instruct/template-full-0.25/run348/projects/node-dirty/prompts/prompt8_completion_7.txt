  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be stored in the database as such, whereas the original code fragment would store the value of `val`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be stored in the database as such, whereas the original code fragment would store the value of `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be stored in the database as such, whereas the original code fragment would store the value of `val`.

DONE.
