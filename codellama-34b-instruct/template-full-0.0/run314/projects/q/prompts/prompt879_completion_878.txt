  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw an error, which would be caught by the `fail` method and the promise would be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the method to return a resolved promise, which would be caught by the `then` method and the promise would be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its argument, but a function that throws an error is being
