  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` instead of `true` when the field is seen for the second time, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to return `false` instead of `true` when the field is not unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` instead of `true` when the field is seen for the second time, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to return `false` instead of `true` when the field is not unique.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `null` instead of `true` when the field is seen for the second time, which would cause the `nonUnique` function to return `null` instead of `true` when the
