  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the `firstLeft` condition is not met, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the `firstLeft` condition is not met, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the `firstLeft` condition is not met, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
