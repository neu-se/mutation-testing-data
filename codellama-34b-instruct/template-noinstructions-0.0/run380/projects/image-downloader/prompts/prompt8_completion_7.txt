  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension is specifically '.jpg'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === path.extname(options.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the file extension is not present, while this new code fragment checks if the file extension of the destination file is the same as the file extension of the source URL.

DONE.
