  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, unhandledReasons.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a copy of the `unhandledReasons` array without the last element, which would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return a different value than the original code.
