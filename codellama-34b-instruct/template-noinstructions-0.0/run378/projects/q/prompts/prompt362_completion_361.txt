  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the rejected value instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the progress value instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the rejected value instead of the fulfilled value.

DONE.
