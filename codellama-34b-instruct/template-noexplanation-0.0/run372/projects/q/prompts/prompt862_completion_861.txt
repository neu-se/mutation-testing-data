  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout + 1)
```
This code fragment is different from the original in that it adds 1 millisecond to the timeout before delaying the promise. This change will cause the promise to be delayed for longer than the original code, which may cause issues in the program's behavior or performance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout - 1)
```
This code fragment is different from the original in that it subtracts 1 millisecond from the timeout before delaying the promise. This change will cause the promise to be delayed for less time than the original code, which may cause issues in the program's behavior or performance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout * 2)
```
This code fragment is different from the original in that it doubles the timeout before delaying the promise. This change will cause the promise to be delayed for twice as long as the original code, which
