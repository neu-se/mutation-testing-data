  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the regex match with 'ves' instead of 'ses', which is not the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w + 'z'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 'z' to the end of the word instead of 's', which is not the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.substr(0, 1) + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 'i' to the beginning of the word instead of 's', which is not the correct plural form.

DONE.
