  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` in cases where it should evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` in cases where it should evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different value than `otherOp.retain`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` in cases where it should evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
