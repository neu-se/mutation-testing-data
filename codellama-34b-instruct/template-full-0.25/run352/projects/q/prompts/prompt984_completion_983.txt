  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with `undefined`, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the string "error", whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error object, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with `undefined`.

DONE.
