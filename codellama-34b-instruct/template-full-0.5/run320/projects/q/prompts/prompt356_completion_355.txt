  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "rejected" instead of the original rejection value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a new error object with the message "rejected" instead of the original rejection value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original promise instead of the rejection value.

DONE.
