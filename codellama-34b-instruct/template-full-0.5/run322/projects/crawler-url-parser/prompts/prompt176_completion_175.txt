  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.host` is a different property than `url`, and would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.pathname` is a different property than `url`, and would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.search` is a different property than `url`, and would return a different value.

DONE.
