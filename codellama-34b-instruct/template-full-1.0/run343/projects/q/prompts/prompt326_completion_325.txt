  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `op`, which could cause the function to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add one to the value of `op`, which could cause the function to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op => op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=>` operator would create a new function that returns its argument unmodified, which could cause the function to return a different value or throw an error.

DONE.
