  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be wrapped in an array, which would cause the `npost` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be replaced with the first element of the `args` array, which would cause the `npost` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be replaced with the last element of the `args` array, which would cause the `npost` method to fail.

DONE.
