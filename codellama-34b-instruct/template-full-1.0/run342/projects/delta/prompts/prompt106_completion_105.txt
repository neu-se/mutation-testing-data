  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
constant value
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant value would no longer be treated as an object property and would always be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation (!) operator would change the logical logic of the code, causing the filter function to always return the opposite result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of arguments passed to the predicate function, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
