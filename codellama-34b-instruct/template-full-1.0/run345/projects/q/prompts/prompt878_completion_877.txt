  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0] = deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the wrong set of arguments.

DONE.
