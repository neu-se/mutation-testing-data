  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` method to return `false` when it should return `true`, leading to incorrect results in the `isFinite` and `isInfinite` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` method to return `null` when it should return `true`, leading to incorrect results in the `isFinite` and `isInfinite` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This change will cause the `isNaN` method to return `undefined` when it should return `true`, leading to incorrect results in the `isFinite` and `isInfinite` methods.

DONE.
