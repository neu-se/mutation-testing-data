  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the current `this` value, which is the promise object. In the original code, `this` is not bound to the promise object, so the `then` method would be called on the global object or `undefined` in strict mode.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `then` method with the current `this` value as the `this` context, which is the promise object. In the original code, `this` is not bound to the promise object, so the `then` method would be called on the global object or `undefined` in strict mode.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `
