  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of operations in the delta, whereas `chop` returns a new delta with the last operation removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new delta with the first operation removed, whereas `chop` returns a new delta with the last operation removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` returns a new delta with the first operation removed and replaced with the provided replacement delta, whereas `chop` returns a new delta with the last operation removed.

DONE.
