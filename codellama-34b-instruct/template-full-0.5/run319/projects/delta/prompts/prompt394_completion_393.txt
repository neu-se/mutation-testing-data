  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called with a length of 0, which would cause the method to return early without performing any operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called with a negative length, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would be called with an infinite length, which would cause the method to loop indefinitely.

DONE.
