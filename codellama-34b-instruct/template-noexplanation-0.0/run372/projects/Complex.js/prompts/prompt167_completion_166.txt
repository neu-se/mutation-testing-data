  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This change will cause the `div` function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This change will cause the `div` function to return `Complex['NAN']` when the divisor is zero, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'] && z['im'] === 0
```
This change will cause the `div` function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero and the dividend is purely real, which is incorrect.

DONE.
