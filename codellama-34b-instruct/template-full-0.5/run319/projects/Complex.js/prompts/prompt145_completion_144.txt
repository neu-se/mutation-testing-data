  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isZero`, and it checks for the opposite condition (infinity instead of zero).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is a different property than `re`, and it checks for the opposite condition (non-zero imaginary part instead of zero real part).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a different property than `im`, and it checks for the opposite condition (non-zero real part instead of zero imaginary part).

DONE.
