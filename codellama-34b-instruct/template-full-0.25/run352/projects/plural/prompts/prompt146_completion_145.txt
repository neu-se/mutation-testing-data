  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a string. Using `rule[0]` would cause the function to return the regular expression instead of the string, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra 's' to the end of the string, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the string to uppercase, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
