Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the trigonometric function from sine to cosine, which will yield different values for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the imaginary part by adding 1 to it, which will affect the output of the complex number calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the input to the sine function by adding 1 to `b`, leading to a different output than the original `Math.sin(b)`.

DONE.
