  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the `e.stack` property starting from the second character, instead of returning the entire property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a trimmed version of the `e.stack` property, removing any leading or trailing whitespace, instead of returning the entire property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first line of the `e.stack` property, instead of returning the entire property.

DONE.
