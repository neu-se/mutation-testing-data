Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.delete === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks for `thisOp.delete` instead of `thisOp.retain`, which could lead to unexpected results when composing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type check for `otherOp.retain` from 'number' to 'string', which would cause the condition to fail when it should succeed, potentially skipping necessary operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'boolean' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
