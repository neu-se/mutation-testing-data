  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if there are more operations to iterate over and the next operation is not an insert, leading to a different set of operations being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue only if there are more operations to iterate over and the next operation is an insert, leading to a different set of operations being applied.

DONE.
