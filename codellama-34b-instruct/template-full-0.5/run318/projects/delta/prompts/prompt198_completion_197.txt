  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the second-to-last position in the delta's operations array, rather than the last position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the last position in the delta's operations array, but also include the second-to-last operation as part of the new operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the last position in the delta's operations array, but also include the last operation as part of the new operation.
