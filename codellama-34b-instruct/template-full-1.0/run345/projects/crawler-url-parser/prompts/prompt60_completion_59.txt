  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any hash fragments from the URL, whereas the original code fragment only removes the hash fragment if it appears at the end of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '').replace(/^\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any hash fragments from the URL and then replace any leading slashes with "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only replace any leading slashes with "http://", but not remove any hash fragments from the URL.

DONE.
