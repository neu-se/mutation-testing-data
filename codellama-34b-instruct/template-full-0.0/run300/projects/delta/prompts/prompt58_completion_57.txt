  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array.isArray` method would be called on `b` instead of `a`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor === Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of `a` would be compared to the `Array` constructor, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not an array.

DONE.
