  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the condition to be `true` if `abort` is `false`, even if `op(data)` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `!==`, which would cause the condition to be `true` if `abort` is `true`, even if `op(data)` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the condition to be `true` if `abort` is not `true`, even if `op(data
