  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would pass the error to the callback, while `null` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would pass the error to the callback, while `undefined` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` would pass the error to the callback, while `new Error()` would create a new error object and pass it to the callback.

DONE.
