  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This change will cause the key to be incremented by 1, which may result in a different key being used for the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This change will cause the key to be doubled, which may result in a different key being used for the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the key to be converted to uppercase, which may result in a different key being used for the cache.

DONE.
