  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
