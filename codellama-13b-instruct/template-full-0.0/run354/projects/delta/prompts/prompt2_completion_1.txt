  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would not merge the `b` object into the `a` object if `b` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would not compare the `a` and `b` objects if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` function would not invert the `attr` object if `base` is undefined.

DONE.
