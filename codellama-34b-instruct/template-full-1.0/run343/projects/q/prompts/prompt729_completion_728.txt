  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes and returns the first element of the `promises` array, whereas the original code uses all the elements of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the `promises` array, whereas the original code uses all the elements of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new array containing all elements of `promises` except the first one, whereas the original code uses all the elements of the array.

DONE.
