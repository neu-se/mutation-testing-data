  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + options
```
This would result in different behavior because `file + options` is not the same as `file, options`, as it would concatenate the strings instead of passing them as separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `file`, as it would cause the `fs.readFileSync` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `options`, as it would cause the `fs.readFileSync` function to throw an error.

DONE.
