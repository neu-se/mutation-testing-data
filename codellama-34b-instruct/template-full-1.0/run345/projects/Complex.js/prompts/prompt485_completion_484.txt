  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `module` is a function, which would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the modified code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `define` is a string, which would evaluate to `false` in the original code, but `true` in the modified code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `exports` is undefined, which would evaluate to `true` in the original code, but `false` in the modified code.

DONE.
