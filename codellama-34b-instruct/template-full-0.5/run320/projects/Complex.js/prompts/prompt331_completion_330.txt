  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `a` is not zero, even if `b` is not equal to 1 or -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1 || b === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1 or -1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1 or -1 and then checks if `a` is equal to zero. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if `b` is equal to 1 or -1 and `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 &&
