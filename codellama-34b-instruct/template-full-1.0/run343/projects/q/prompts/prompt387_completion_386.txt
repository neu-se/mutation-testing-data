  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is a non-null object, so passing `null` as an argument would cause a `NullPointerException` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is a non-null object, so passing `undefined` as an argument would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is a function, so passing `Object` as an argument would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
