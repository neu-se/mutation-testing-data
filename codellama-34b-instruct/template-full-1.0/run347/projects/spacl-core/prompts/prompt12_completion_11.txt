  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.search` returns the index of the first match, whereas `spec.match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.replace` replaces the matched text with a new string, whereas `spec.match` returns an array of all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.startsWith` returns a boolean indicating whether the string starts with the specified text, whereas `spec.match` returns an array of all matches.

DONE.
