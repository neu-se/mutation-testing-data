  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a callback function as the first argument, while the replacement code calls the callback function with a null value, which would cause the callback to be invoked immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a callback function as the first argument, while the replacement code calls the callback function with an undefined value, which would cause the callback to be invoked immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a callback function as the first argument, while the replacement code calls the callback function without any arguments, which would cause the callback to be invoked immediately and potentially cause an error.

DONE.
