  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message to indicate that the row at the end of the database is corrupted, whereas the original code would indicate that the entire row is corrupted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Invalid JSON in database: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message to indicate that the JSON in the database is invalid, whereas the original code would indicate that the row is corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted database: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message to indicate that the entire database is corrupted, whereas the original code would indicate that a specific row is corrupted.

DONE.
