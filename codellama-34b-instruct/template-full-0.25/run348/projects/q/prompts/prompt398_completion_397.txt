  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `thenResolve` method would not be called, causing the promise to be resolved with a value of `null` instead of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `thenResolve` method would not be called, causing the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and the `thenResolve` method would not be called, causing the promise to be resolved with a value of `0` instead of `value`.

DONE.
