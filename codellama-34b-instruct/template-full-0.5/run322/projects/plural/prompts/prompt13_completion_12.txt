  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` returns a substring from the specified position to the end of the string, while `w.substring` returns a substring from the specified position with the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` returns a substring from the specified position to the end of the string, while `w.slice` returns a substring from the specified position with the specified length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substr` returns a substring from the specified position to the end of the string, while `w.substr(1)` returns a substring from the specified position with the specified length, but starting from the second character.

DONE.
