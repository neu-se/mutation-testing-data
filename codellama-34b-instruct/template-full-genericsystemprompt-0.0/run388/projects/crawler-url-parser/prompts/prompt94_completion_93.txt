  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the value of the `href` attribute, while this modified code fragment returns the concatenation of the `href` attribute and the string "test".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `href` attribute, while this modified code fragment replaces the "http://" protocol with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `href` attribute, while this modified code fragment returns only the first part of the `href` attribute, separated by the "/" character.

DONE.
