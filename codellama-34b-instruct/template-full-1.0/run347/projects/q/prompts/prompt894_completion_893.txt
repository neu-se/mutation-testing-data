  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `!array_slice` would return the opposite boolean result of `array_slice`, potentially leading to incorrect functioning of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(this, [])` would return an empty array, which would likely cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.slice(0, -1)` would return the first n-1 elements of the array, potentially leading to incorrect functioning of the surrounding code.

DONE.
