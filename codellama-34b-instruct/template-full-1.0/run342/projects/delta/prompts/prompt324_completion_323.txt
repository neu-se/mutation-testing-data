  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the +1 causes the function to skip over the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the -length causes the function to start at a position that is length characters earlier in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + Math.random()*length
```
This would result in different behavior because the random offset would cause the function to start at a random position within the string, rather than at the beginning.

DONE.
