 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return []; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` method would always return an empty array instead of resolving or rejecting based on the first resolved or rejected promise in the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q.reject('Buggy implementation'); }
