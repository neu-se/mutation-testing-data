  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.previous` returns the previous operation in the iteration, whereas `otherIter.next` returns the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the iteration to move to the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the iteration to move to the previous operation.

DONE.
