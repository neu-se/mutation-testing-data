  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid object and `void 0` is not, and using `null` would change the behavior of the code in the promise's `.fail()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid object and `void 0` is, and using `undefined` would change the behavior of the code in the promise's `.fail()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid object and `void 0` is not, and using `0` would change the behavior of the code in the promise's `.fail()` method.

DONE.
