  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while the modified code fragment calculates the negative hyperbolic cosine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while the modified code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a+b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, while the modified code fragment calculates the hyperbolic cosine of `a+b`.

DONE.
