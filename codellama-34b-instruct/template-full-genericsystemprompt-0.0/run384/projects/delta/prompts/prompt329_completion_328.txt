  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the attributes of the op, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only invert the attributes of the op if it has at least one attribute, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only invert the attributes of the op if it has no attributes, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
