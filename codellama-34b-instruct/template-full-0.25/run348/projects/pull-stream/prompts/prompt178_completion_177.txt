  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with the `cb` function as the first argument, rather than the `abort` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `abort` function as the first argument, rather than the `abortCb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onAbort` function with the `cb` function as the first argument, rather than the `abortCb` function.

DONE.
