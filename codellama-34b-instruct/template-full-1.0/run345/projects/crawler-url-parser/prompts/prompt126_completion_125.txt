  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` option would cause the parser to interpret the input `url` as a URL with a protocol, rather than a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `slashesDenoteHost` option would cause the parser to interpret the input `url` as a path, rather than a URL with a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, URL.DEFAULT_PORT, URL.DEFAULT_PORT)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `DEFAULT_PORT` value for the `port` option would cause the parser to use a default port for the URL, rather than using the port provided in the input `url`.

DONE.
