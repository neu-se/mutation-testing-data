  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has a property with the given name, but it does not check if the property is a number. By using `object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')`, we are checking if the object has a property called 'latitude' and if it is a number.

DONE.
