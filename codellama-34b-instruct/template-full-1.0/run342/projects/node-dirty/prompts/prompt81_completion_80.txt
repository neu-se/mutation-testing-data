  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable is not defined. Instead, `null` is passed, which could cause the callback to be called with a non-error value, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable is not defined. Instead, `undefined` is passed, which could cause the callback to be called with a non-error value, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable is not defined. Instead, an empty object is passed, which could cause the callback to be called with a non-error value, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
