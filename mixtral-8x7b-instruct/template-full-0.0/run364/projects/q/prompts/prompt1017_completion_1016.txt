 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not called, and the promise is immediately rejected with no error information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("pre", [name, nodeArgs]).fail;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the wrong event type ("pre" instead of "post"). This could cause the method to be handled by a different event handler or not handled at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve;
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is immediately resolved with no value or error information. This could cause the promise to be settled in a way that is not consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

DONE.
