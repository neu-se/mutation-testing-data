  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a stack trace that includes the line number of the error, which could be useful for debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a stack trace that includes the line number of the error, but with an offset of 2, which could be useful for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a stack trace that includes the line number of the error, but with an offset of 3, which could be useful for debugging.

DONE.
