  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `insert` property is being accessed instead of the `insert` property itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is being called on the `insert` property instead of the `insert` property itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first character of the `insert` property is being accessed instead of the `insert` property itself. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `insert` property is not a string or if it is an empty string.

DONE.
