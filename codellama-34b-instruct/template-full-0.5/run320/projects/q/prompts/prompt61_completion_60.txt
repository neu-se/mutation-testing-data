  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `window`, and would cause the `bind` method to return a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `window`, and would cause the `bind` method to return a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object (in non-strict mode), which is different from `window` in most cases.

DONE.
