  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a positive sign for the variable `b`, while the mutated code fragment has a negative sign. This change would cause the `atanh` function to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplies the variable `b` by 1, while the mutated code fragment multiplies it by 2. This change would cause the `atanh` function to produce different results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 0 to the variable `b`, while the mutated code fragment adds 1. This change would cause the `atanh` function to produce different results for certain input values.

DONE.
