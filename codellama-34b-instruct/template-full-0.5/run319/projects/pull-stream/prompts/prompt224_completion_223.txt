  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is called with the `data` parameter, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is called with an extra argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
