  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return `1` instead of the correct index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return the original index instead of the correct index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return the length of the delta minus 1 instead of the correct index.

DONE.
