  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a function that memoizes a timezone object, while `memoizeCountry` is a function that memoizes a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildTimezone` is a function that builds a timezone object, while `memoizeCountry` is a function that memoizes a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` is a function that retrieves a timezone object, while `memoizeCountry` is a function that memoizes a country object.

DONE.
