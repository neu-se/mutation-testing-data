  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a) + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `b` is not included in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `a` is subtracted instead of added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + Math.abs(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of `b` is used instead of `b` directly.

DONE.
