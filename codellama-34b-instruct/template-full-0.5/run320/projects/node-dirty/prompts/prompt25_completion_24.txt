  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with an error, whereas the original code would call it with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with an error message, whereas the original code would call it with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the value of the key, whereas the original code would call it with no arguments.

DONE.
