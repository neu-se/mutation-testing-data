 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
retDelta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from the array, while `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
retDelta['push']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation to access the `push` method, which would allow for dynamic property names. However, in this case, it would still behave the same way as the original code since `'push'` is a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
retDelta.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, not the end.

DONE.
