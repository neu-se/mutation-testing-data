  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the code would use the value of `y` instead of `x` in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add 1 to the value of `x` before using it in the calculation, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would multiply the value of `x` by 2 before using it in the calculation, which would change the result.

DONE.
