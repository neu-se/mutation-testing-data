Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", key, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes the `key` and `value` as separate arguments instead of as an array, which would lead to an error in the dispatch method expecting an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("update", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an invalid operation name "update" instead of "set", which would not be recognized by the dispatch method, leading to a failure in property setting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `value` argument, which means the property would not be set to the intended value, potentially leaving it unchanged.

DONE.
