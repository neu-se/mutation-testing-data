  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the zero would cause the subsequent code to always execute the else block, which is not the intention.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the one would cause the subsequent code to always execute the else block, which is not the intention.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null would cause the subsequent code to always execute the else block, which is not the intention.

DONE.
