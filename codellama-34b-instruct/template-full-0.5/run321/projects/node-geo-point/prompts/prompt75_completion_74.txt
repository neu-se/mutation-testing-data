  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would return a number with the value of the `bearing` variable, while the `Math.PI / 180` multiplication would return a number with the value of `bearing` multiplied by the ratio of `Math.PI` to 180.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would return a number with the value of the `bearing` variable, while the `Math.PI` multiplication would return a number with the value of `bearing` multiplied by `Math.PI`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would return a number with the value of the `bearing` variable
