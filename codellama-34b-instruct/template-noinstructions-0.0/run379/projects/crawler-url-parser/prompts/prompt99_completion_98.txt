  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the property is an own property of the object, whereas `has` checks if the property exists in the object, including inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` returns the value associated with the property, whereas `has` returns a boolean indicating whether the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the number of elements in the map, whereas `has` checks if the property exists.

DONE.
