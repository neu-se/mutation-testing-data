  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `end` argument, while the modified code fragment calls the callback function with both the `end` and `i++` arguments. This change would cause the callback function to be called with an unexpected argument, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

DONE.
