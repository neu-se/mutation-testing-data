  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the added "bug" string would cause the output JSON file to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the added "null" string would cause the output JSON file to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the added "undefined" string would cause the output JSON file to be invalid, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` function to throw an error.

DONE.
