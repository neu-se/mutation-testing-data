  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
DONE
```

This would result in different behavior because the `DONE` statement is a dummy statement that does nothing, unlike `retDelta.chop()` which chops the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.flatten()
```

This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.flatten()` would flatten the delta, but the original code kept the delta as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(retDelta.length())
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code kept the delta's length, unlike this option which deletes the entire delta.
