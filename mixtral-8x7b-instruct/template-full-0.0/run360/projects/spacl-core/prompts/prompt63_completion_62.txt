 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method modifies the original array, so the `props` array will be empty in the `Matcher` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array, leaving the `props` array empty in the `Matcher` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with all elements passing the test, which is always true, so the `props` array will be empty in the `Matcher` constructor.

DONE.
