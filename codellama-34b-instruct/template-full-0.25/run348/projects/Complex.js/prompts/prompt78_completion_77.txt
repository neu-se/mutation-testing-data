  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second element of the `tokens` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially accessing an element that does not exist in the `tokens` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, potentially causing the code to behave differently when encountering certain characters in the input string.

DONE.
