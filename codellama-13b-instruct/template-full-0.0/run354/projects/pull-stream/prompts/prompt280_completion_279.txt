  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with an additional argument, which would cause it to throw an error if it is not expecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being called with a different context, which could cause it to behave differently if it is not expecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.bind(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is now being bound to a different context, which could cause it to behave differently if it is not expecting it.

DONE.
