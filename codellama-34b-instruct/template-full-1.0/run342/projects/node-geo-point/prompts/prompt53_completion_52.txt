  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2 - φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function, which takes the tangent of the ratio of the coordinates' differences, while the new code fragment uses simply the difference of the coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2 - φ1) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function, which takes the tangent of the ratio of the coordinates' differences, while the new code fragment uses the difference of the coordinates and adds 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ2 - φ1) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function, which takes the tangent of the ratio of the coordinates' differences, while the new code fragment uses the difference of the coordinates and multiplies it by 2.
