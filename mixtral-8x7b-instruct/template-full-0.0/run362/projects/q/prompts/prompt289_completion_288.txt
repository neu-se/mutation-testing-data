 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array instead of the resolver function to the `promise` function, causing the function to throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the resolver function to the `promise` function, causing the function to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a function that always returns 42 instead of the resolver function to the `promise` function. This would cause the returned promise to always resolve to the value 42, instead of resolving to the value returned by the resolver function.

DONE.
