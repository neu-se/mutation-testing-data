  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to always return `true` when the `end` argument is truthy, regardless of whether it is `true` or not. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `true` as the first argument, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to always return `false` when the `end` argument is falsy, regardless of whether it is `false` or not. This would cause the `read` function to be called with `false` as the first argument, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to always return `null` when the
