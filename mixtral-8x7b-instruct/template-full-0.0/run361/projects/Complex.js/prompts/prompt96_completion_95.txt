 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function would return true, causing the function to exit prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would treat any input with a non-zero real part as a valid number, even if it is not a valid complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would return `null` instead of a complex number, causing the function to exit prematurely.

DONE.
