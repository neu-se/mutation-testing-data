 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for reference equality instead of deep equality. If the attributes objects have the same properties and values but are not the same object, this would cause the condition to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
JSON.stringify(newOp.attributes) === JSON.stringify(lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for stringified equality instead of deep equality. If the attributes objects have the same properties and values but are in a different order, this would cause the condition to pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
isEqual(lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments. If the `isEqual` function is not commutative, this would cause the condition to fail.

DONE.
