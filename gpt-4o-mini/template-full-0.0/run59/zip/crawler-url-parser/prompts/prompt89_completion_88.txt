Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the text of the anchor element to uppercase, potentially altering the expected text value that is stored in `currentUrl.text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('title').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve the `title` attribute of the anchor element instead of its text content, which may lead to `currentUrl.text` being `undefined` if the `title` attribute is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the HTML content of the anchor element instead of just the text, which could include HTML tags and lead to unexpected results in `currentUrl.text`.

DONE.
