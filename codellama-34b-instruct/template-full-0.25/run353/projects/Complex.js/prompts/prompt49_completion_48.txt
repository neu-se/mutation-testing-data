  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the logical negation of `Number.isFinite`, which means that it will return `true` if the argument is not a finite number, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used to check if the argument is a finite number, and if it is not, the function returns `Complex.INFINITY`. By replacing it with `!Number.isFinite`, the function will return `Complex.INFINITY` if the argument is a finite number, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a function that checks if the argument is NaN (Not a Number), and it will return `true` if the argument is NaN, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `Number.isFinite` is used
