  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reducer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `acc` and `data` are not passed as arguments to `reducer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc && reducer(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc` is not used as a condition for calling `reducer`, and `reducer` is called with only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + reducer(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` operator is used instead of `,` operator, and `reducer` is called with only one argument.

DONE.
