 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
"string".length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[Symbol.match]` method expects a string as its argument, but it would now receive a number, causing a compilation error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.spec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[Symbol.match]` method expects a string as its argument, but it would now receive a `spec` property, causing a compilation error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[Symbol.match]` method expects a string as its argument, but it would now receive a random number, causing a compilation error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
