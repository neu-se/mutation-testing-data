  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match words that end with a consonant followed by 'y', instead of matching words that end with either 'y' or 'quy'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match words that end with 'quy', instead of matching words that end with either 'y' or 'quy'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies'
