  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(this.longitude, this.latitude);
```
This code fragment creates a new `Tile` object with the `longitude` and `latitude` properties of the `GeoPoint` object, which is different from the original code fragment that uses the `toTile` method of the `GeoPoint` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(this.latitude, this.longitude);
```
This code fragment creates a new `Tile` object with the `latitude` and `longitude` properties of the `GeoPoint` object, which is different from the original code fragment that uses the `toTile` method of the `GeoPoint` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(this.longitude + 1, this.latitude + 1);
```
This code fragment creates a new `Tile` object with the `long
