  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a resolver function that always resolves with a value of `null`, regardless of the actual value of the promise. This will likely cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `nfbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a resolver function that always resolves with a value of `undefined`, regardless of the actual value of the promise. This will likely cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `nfbind` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This change will cause the `makeNodeResolver` function to return a resolver function that always resolves with a value of an empty function, regardless of the actual value of the promise. This will likely
