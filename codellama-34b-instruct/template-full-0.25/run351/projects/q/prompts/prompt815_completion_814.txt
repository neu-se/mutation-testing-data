  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw` to propagate the rejection reason, while this replacement uses `throw` to throw an error unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw` to propagate the rejection reason, while this replacement uses `Q.reject` to explicitly reject the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw` to propagate the rejection reason, while this replacement uses `Q.resolve` to resolve the promise with the rejection reason.

DONE.
