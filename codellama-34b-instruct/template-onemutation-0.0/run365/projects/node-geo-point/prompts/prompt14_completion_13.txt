  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `point.coordinates` is an array, but does not check its length. The modified code fragment checks if `point.coordinates` is an array and has a length of 2. If the length is not 2, the modified code fragment would return `false`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true`.
