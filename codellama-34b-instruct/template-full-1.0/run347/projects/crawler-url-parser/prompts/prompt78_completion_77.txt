  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('body a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements in the `body` element, whereas the original code selects all `a` elements on the page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a[href]')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements with a `href` attribute, whereas the original code selects all `a` elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').not('[href]')
```
This would result in different behavior because it selects all `a` elements without a `href` attribute, whereas the original code selects all `a` elements.

DONE.
