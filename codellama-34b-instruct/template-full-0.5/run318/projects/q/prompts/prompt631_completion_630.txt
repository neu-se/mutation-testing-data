  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a different method than `delete`, and it would not delete the property but instead set it to a new value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method than `delete`, and it would not delete the property but instead retrieve its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a method, and it would cause an error when trying to invoke it.

DONE.
