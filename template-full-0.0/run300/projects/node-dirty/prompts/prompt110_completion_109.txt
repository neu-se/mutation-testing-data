  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, whereas the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

DONE.
