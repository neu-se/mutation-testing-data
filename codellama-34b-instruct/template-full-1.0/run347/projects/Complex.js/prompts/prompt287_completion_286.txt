  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would use the cosine instead of the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would add the real and imaginary parts instead of multiplying them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would use the tangent instead of the sine.

DONE.
