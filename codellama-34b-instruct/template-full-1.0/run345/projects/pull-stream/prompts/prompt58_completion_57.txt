  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` (the original code fragment) checks the truthiness of the `done` variable, while `!done()` (the new code fragment) checks the return value of the `done` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done.called
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` (the original code fragment) checks the truthiness of the `done` variable, while `!done.called` (the new code fragment) checks the `called` property of the `done` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done.result
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` (the original code fragment) checks the truthiness of the `done` variable, while `!done.result` (the new code fragment) checks the `result` property of the `done` function.

DONE.
