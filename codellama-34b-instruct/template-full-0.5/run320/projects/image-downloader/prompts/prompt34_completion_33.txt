  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` expects a function as an argument, and `null` is not a function. In the original code, the function passed to `res.resume()` is a no-op, but with `null`, it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` expects a function as an argument, and `() => {}` is a function that does nothing. In the original code, the function passed to `res.resume()` is a no-op, but with `() => {}`, it would execute the no-op function, which could potentially have side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` expects a function as an argument, and `
