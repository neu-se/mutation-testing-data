 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a copy of the `props` array instead of reversing it in-place, which may cause the `Matcher` instance to use incorrect property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.filter(prop => prop !== '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes empty strings from the `props` array, potentially causing the `Matcher` instance to ignore some property references.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sorts the `props` array alphabetically, which may not match the order of property references in the path specification.

DONE.
