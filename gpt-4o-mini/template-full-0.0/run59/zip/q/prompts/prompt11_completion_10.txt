Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected module definition from a function to a string, which would cause the module to not export the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the context in which the `definition` function is executed, potentially leading to unexpected results if `definition` relies on its original context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the `definition` function with a different context (`this`), which may lead to different variable bindings and behavior if `definition` uses `this` internally.

DONE.
