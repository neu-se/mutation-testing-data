  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first operand instead of the second operand to the progress listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the third operand instead of the second operand to the progress listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the progress listener instead of the expected value.

DONE.
