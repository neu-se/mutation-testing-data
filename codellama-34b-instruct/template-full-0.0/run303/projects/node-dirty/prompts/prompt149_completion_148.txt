  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the callbacks would be called in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, so the first callback would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== cbs[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, so the first callback would be removed from the array.

DONE.
