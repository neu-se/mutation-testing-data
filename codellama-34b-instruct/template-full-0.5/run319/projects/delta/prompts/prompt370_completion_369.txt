  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the entire delta, whereas `delta.retain` would retain only the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(length + 1)` would retain one more character than the original code, potentially causing the transformation to be off by one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(length - 1)` would retain one less character than the original code, potentially causing the transformation to be off by one character.

DONE.
