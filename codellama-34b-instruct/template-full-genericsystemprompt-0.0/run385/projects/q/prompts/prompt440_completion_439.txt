  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the reason for the rejection instead of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the promise that was reported as unhandled instead of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the reason for the rejection instead of the promise.

DONE.
