  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is not a method of the `Promise` prototype, and it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, and it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, and it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
