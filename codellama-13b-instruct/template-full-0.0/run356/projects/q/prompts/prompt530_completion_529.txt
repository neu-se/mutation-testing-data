  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called with the `reason` argument, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function is called with the `value` argument, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function is called with the `value` and `fulfilled` arguments, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
