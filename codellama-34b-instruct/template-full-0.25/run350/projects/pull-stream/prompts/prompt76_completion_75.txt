  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true, done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && true), (done && function () {})`, which would always evaluate to `true` and a no-op function, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort || false), (done || function () {})`, which would always evaluate to `abort` and a no-op function, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false, done && function () {}
```
