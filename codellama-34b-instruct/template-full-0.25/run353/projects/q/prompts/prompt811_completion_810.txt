  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a function that calls the callback with the given arguments, but in this case, no arguments are provided, which may cause the callback to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a function that calls the callback with the given arguments, but in this case, no arguments are provided, which may cause the callback to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a function that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, and its arguments are the provided arguments. In this case, no arguments are provided, which may cause the callback to behave differently.

DONE.
