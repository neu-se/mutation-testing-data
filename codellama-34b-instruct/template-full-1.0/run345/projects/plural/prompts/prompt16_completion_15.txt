  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in a bug because the code would add "ies" to words that end in "y", rather than "es".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 2
```
This would result in a bug because the code would add "ies" to words that end in "y", rather than "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in a different behavior because the code would add "ies" to words that end in "y", rather than "es".

DONE.
