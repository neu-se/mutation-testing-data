  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the character at the specified index instead of pushing it to the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(index, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a space character at the specified index instead of pushing the character to the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(index, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the character at the specified index instead of pushing it to the line.

DONE.
