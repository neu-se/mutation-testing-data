  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `allResolved` method would return a rejected promise with an error message indicating that all promises were rejected. In contrast, the original code fragment `this` would return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, which may or may not be rejected.
