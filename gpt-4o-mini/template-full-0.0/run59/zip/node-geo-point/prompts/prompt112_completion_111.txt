Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of an angle, while `Math.tan` calculates the tangent, leading to incorrect results in the calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` computes the cosine of an angle instead of the tangent, which would significantly alter the calculations related to the latitude and longitude, resulting in incorrect tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.tan(1)` would return a constant value (the tangent of 1 radian) instead of calculating the tangent of the variable angle, leading to a fixed and incorrect output for the tile coordinates.

DONE.
