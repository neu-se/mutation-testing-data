  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the semicolon is a statement terminator, and the original code used a comma to separate the glob parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the pipe symbol is a bitwise OR operator, and the original code used a comma to separate the glob parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the ampersand symbol is a bitwise AND operator, and the original code used a comma to separate the glob parts.

DONE.
