  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {
    throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all " +
        "promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the rejection message to include the error message from the last rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {
    throw new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all " +
        "promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the try/catch block and allow the rejection error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all
