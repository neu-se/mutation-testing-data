  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array_slice(arguments)]
``` 
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `args` variable, which is a shallow copy of the `arguments` object that is created earlier in the function. Using `array_slice` on `arguments` directly would include the `object` and `args` variables in the copy, whereas the original code fragment does not include them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not a function parameter, but it is being passed as an argument to the `Q.dispatch` method. The original code fragment does not pass `arguments` as an argument to `Q.dispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because
