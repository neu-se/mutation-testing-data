  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would always return the same value, instead of returning the value of the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail.head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `head` property of the `tail` object, instead of the value of the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `tail` property of the `tail` object, instead of the value of the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object.

DONE.
