  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete` only removes the element at the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with an undefined value would overwrite the existing value at the specified key, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with a null value would overwrite the existing value at the specified key, whereas `delete` would remove the key-value pair altogether.

DONE.
