  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.length, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the total length of the ops array, whereas the original code calculates the length of the last op in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.retain, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the total retain value of the ops array, whereas the original code calculates the length of the last op in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.insert, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the total insert value of the ops array, whereas the original code calculates the length of the last op in the array.

DONE.
