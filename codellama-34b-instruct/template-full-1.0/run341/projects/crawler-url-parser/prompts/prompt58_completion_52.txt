  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different from the original, and it matches a different part of the string. The original regular expression uses the global flag (g) and the dotall flag (s), which can cause the regular expression to match newlines as well as other characters. The new regular expression only matches non-forward-slash characters at the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different from the original, and it matches a different part of the string. The original regular expression uses the global flag (g) and the dotall flag (s), which can cause the regular expression to match newlines as well as other characters. The new regular expression only matches forward-slash characters at the start of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior
