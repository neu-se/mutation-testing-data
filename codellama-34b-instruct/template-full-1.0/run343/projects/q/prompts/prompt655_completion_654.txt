  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the value `1` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the value `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called with the value `undefined` instead of the expected object.

DONE.
