 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first character of the captured group, changing the captured value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
''.concat(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an empty string at the beginning of the captured group, changing the captured value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
globalThis[part]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the captured group as a property of the global `this` object, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
