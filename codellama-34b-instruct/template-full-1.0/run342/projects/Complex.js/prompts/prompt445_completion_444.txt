  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator ensures that `places` is a non-null value, but the value of `places` is not considered in the calculation of the return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || {a: 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because `places` would become an object with a property `a` that is set to `1`, which would cause errors if `places` is used as a number in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1 || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation `places + 1` would produce a different result than just `places` alone, which would affect the return value.

DONE.
