  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would extract the first element of the `arguments` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would start extracting elements from the `arguments` array at the second index, whereas the original code fragment started at one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, -1)` would extract the last element of the `arguments` array, which is not the same as the original code fragment `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

DONE.
