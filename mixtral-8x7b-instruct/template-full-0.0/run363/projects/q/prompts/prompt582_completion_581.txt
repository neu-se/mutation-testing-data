 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer, "throw", undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a default value for the `arg` parameter in the `continuer` function, which could cause the error handling to behave differently if the `throw` operation is called without an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `continuer` function with a new function that always throws an error, which would cause the async generator to always reject with an error instead of properly handling the different operations (`next`, `throw`, etc.).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer, "someInvalidOperation"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an invalid operation name, which would cause an exception to be thrown and the async generator to fail to handle the operation properly.

DONE.
