  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenated stack traces would be separated by a single space instead of a newline and separator string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenated stack traces would be separated by a tab character instead of a newline and separator string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<br>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenated stack traces would be separated by an HTML line break instead of a newline and separator string.

DONE.
