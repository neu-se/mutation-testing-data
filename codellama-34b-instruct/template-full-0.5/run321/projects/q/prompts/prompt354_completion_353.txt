  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that can be used to throw an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `throw` is a keyword that can be used to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.when(Q.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the given reason.

DONE.
