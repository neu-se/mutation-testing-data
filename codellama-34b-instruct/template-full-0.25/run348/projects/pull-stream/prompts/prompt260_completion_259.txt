  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this replacement checks if `err` is truthy. This could cause the `nextStream` function to be called with a non-error value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this replacement checks if `err` is equal to `true`. This could cause the `nextStream` function to be called with a different error value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this
