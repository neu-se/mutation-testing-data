  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `toString()` method on `concatedStacks`, which would return a string representation of the concatenated stacks, whereas the original code fragment would return the concatenated stacks as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of `concatedStacks` starting from the second character, whereas the original code fragment would return the concatenated stacks starting from the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.substr(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of `concatedStacks` starting from the last character, whereas the original code fragment would return the concatenated stacks starting from the first character.

DONE.
