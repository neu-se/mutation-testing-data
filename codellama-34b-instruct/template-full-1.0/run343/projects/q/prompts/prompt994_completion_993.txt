  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<deferred.resolve>
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called immediately, without waiting for the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<deferred.reject>
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called immediately, without waiting for the promise to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<deferred.notify>
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called immediately, without waiting for the promise to resolve.

DONE.
