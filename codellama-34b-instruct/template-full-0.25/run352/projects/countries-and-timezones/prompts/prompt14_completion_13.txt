  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` properties are not initialized to empty arrays, which could cause errors if they are accessed before they are initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: null, all: null } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` properties are initialized to `null`, which could cause errors if they are accessed as arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: undefined, all: undefined } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` and `all` properties are initialized to `undefined`, which could cause errors if they are accessed as arrays.

DONE.
