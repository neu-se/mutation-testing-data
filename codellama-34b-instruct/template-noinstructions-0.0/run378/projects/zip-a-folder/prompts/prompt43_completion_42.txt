  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match all files in the directory instead of just the ones specified by the glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match all files in the directory that have the same name as the glob pattern, instead of just the ones that match the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart + '**'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match all files in the directory and its subdirectories, instead of just the ones in the directory.

DONE.
