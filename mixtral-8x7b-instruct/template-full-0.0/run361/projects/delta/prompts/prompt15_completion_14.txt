 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` and `undefined` values of `a` as equal, while the original condition checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof a !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `a` as a non-object if it is a number, boolean, or symbol, while the original condition checks specifically for non-object `a` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `a` as a non-object if it is an array, while the original condition checks specifically for non-object `a` values.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting unexpected behavior in the code. DONE.
