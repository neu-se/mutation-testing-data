 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for null explicitly, while the original code checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(countries).includes(country.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the country object is already in the countries object, while the original code checks if it's not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the country variable is undefined, while the original code checks if the country object is not defined.

DONE.
