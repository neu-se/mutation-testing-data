  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not an object, regardless of whether it is `null` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not `null`, regardless of whether it is an object or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(b, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `b` is not equal to `null`, regardless of whether it is an object or not.

DONE.
