  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the first point, while `λ2` is the longitude of the second point. Using `λ1` instead of `λ2` would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value, while `φ2` and `λ2` are variables. Using `0` instead of `φ2` or `λ2` would result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
