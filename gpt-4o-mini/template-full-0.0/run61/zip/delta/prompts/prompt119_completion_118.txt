Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the length by using the `insert` property instead of the entire `elem`, potentially leading to incorrect length calculations when `elem` does not have an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the actual length calculation with a constant value of `0`, which would always return a length of `0` regardless of the actual content of `elem`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `retain` property instead of the entire `elem`, which could lead to incorrect length calculations if `elem` does not have a `retain` property or if it is not a number.

DONE.
