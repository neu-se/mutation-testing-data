  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element at a given index. In this case, `pop()` would remove the last unhandled rejection, which may not be the same as the one that was just added.

DONE.
