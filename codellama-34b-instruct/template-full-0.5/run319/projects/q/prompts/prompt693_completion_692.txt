  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)` would return an array with the first argument of `fcall`, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array with all arguments except the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the same as `undefined` and would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined` and would cause the function to return `null` instead of a promise.

DONE.
