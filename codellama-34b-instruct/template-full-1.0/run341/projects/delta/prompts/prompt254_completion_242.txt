  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `next` method returns the next operation itself, which could be a different length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rest` method returns the remaining operations in the iterator, while the `next` method returns only the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, while the `next` method advances the iterator.

DONE.
