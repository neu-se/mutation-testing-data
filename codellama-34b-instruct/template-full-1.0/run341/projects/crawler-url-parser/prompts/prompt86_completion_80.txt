  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim` method would not be called, and the `text` method would return the elements text content along with potential leading and trailing whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` method would return an array of strings, where each string represents a word in the elements text content, and the `split` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().includes(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method would return a boolean value indicating whether the elements text content contains a space, and the `text` method would not be called.

DONE.
