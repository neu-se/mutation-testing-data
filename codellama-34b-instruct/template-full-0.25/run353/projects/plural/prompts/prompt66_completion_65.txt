  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with the same match pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the `rules` array, while this code fragment would replace an existing rule with the same match pattern.

DONE.
