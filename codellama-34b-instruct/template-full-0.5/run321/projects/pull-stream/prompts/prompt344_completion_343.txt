  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && !(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the ternary expression, causing the `onAbort` function to be called with `null` instead of `abort` when `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === false ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary expression would evaluate to `null` when `abort` is falsy, instead of `abort` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === true ? abort : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary expression would evaluate to `abort` when `abort` is truthy, instead of `null` as in the original code.

DONE.
