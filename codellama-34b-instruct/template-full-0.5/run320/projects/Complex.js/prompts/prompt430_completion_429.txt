  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` always rounds up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` always rounds to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` always rounds up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(x) => x
```
This would result in different behavior because the identity function `(x) => x` always returns its input, while `Math.ceil` always rounds up.

DONE.
