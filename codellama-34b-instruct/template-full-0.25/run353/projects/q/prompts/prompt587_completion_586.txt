  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator.bind(this))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `this` context of the `makeGenerator` function to the `this` context of the `spawn` function, which could potentially change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator.bind(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `this` context of the `makeGenerator` function to `null`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator.bind(undefined))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `this` context of the `makeGenerator` function to `undefined`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `makeGenerator` function.

DONE.
