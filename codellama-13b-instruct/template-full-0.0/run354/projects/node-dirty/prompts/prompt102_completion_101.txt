  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the key from the data map, while the new code fragment deletes the key from the data map and then returns the deleted value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value associated with the key in the data map, while the new code fragment returns the value associated with the key in the data map and then deletes the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value associated with the key in the data map to undefined, while the new code fragment sets the value associated with the key in the data map to undefined and then returns the deleted value.

DONE.
