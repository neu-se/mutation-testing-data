  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return index;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original index, regardless of the operations performed on the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the delta, regardless of the operations performed on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the base index of the delta, regardless of the operations performed on it.

DONE.
