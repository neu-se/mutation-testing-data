 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) !== undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the URL in the map instead of just checking if the URL exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the URL is in the map, but does not retrieve the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'urlMap.prototype.has.call(urlMap, currentUrl.url)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to explicitly set the `this` context to `urlMap` when calling the `has` method.

DONE.
