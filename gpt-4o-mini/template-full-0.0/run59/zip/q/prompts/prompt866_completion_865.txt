Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a resolved promise immediately instead of a deferred object, which means the subsequent `resolve` call will not have any effect, and the promise will not wait for the timeout to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer().promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the promise directly to `deferred`, which means that the `resolve` method will not be available on `deferred`, leading to an error when trying to call `deferred.resolve(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = { resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} };
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a mock `deferred` object that does not actually implement the promise functionality, meaning that calling `deferred.resolve(value)` will do nothing and the promise will never resolve.

DONE.
