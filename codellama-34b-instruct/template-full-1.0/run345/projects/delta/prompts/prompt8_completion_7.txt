  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for not null, while the new code checks for undefined. If a property is null, it will be treated as if it is not there, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a property is null, while the new code checks if it is not undefined. If a property is null, it will be treated as if it is not there, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a property exists, while the new code checks if it is not in the prototype chain. If a property is in the prototype chain, it will be treated as if it is not there, which could lead to unexpected results.
