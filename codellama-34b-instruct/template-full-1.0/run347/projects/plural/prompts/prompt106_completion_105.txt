  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(\b(?:123|456|789)s\b', function(w, regex) { return w.replace(regex, 'xes') })
```
This would result in different behavior because a new rule is added to the existing rules list, which would cause the plural function to return a different result for words that match the new rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:123|456|789)s\b', function(w, regex) { return w.replace(regex, 'xes'); })
```
This would result in different behavior because a new rule is added to
