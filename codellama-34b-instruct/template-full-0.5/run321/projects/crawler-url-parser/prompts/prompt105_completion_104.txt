  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the `text` variable with an empty string, while this code fragment concatenates `text` with the string "bug".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `text` variable, while this code fragment converts it to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the `text` variable, while this code fragment removes the first character of the string.

DONE.
