  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value, so if `value` is truthy, it would become falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value, which could change its type or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value, which could change its type or value.

DONE.
