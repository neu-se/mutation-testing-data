  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that needs to be called with the object as its context, otherwise it will return `false` for inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method instead of the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object, but passes the property name as a string instead of a symbol.

DONE.
