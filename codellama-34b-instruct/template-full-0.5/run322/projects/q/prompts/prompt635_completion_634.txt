  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property from an object, and if the object is null, it will throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property from an object, and if the object is undefined, it will throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.del` method is used to delete a property from an object, and if the object is a number, it will throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

DONE.
