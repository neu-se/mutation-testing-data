  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `res` is `null`, even if `res` is not `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a strict inequality operator, so it would only evaluate to `true` if `res` is not `false` and not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is a logical NOT operator, so it would evaluate to `true` if `res` is `false` or `null`.

DONE.
