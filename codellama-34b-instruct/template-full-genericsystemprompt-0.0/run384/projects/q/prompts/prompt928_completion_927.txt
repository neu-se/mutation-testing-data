  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `Q.denodeify` function, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one to the `Q.denodeify` function, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments as an array, but the array would be empty, instead of containing all the arguments.

DONE.
