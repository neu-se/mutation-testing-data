  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `parse` is not defined in the code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"extract"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `extract` is not defined in the code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"gettype"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` is not defined in the code snippet, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
