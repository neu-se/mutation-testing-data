  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of the word "memo" to the list of rules, while the modified code fragment adds the same word as both the singular and plural form. This would cause the pluralization function to return the same word for both singular and plural forms, which is incorrect.
