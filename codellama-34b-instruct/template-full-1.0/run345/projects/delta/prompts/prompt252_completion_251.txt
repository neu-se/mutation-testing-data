  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would expect the iterator to move forward by 1, but instead it would stay at the same index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would expect the iterator to move forward by 1, but instead it would move backwards by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would expect the iterator to move forward by 1, but instead it would move forward by 2.

DONE.
