  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
        if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
        if (this._inFlightWrites <= 0 && !this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
        for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
      });
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._inFlightWrites <= 0` would always be true, causing the `drain` event to be emitted every time, even when it's not supposed to.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
        if (!cbs.length && err != null) this.emit('error', err);
        if (this._waitForDrain) this.emit('drain');
        for (const cb of cbs) cb(err);
      });
```
This would result in
