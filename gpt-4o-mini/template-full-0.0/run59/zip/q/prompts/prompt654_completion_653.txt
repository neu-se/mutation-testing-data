Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a resolved promise instead of dispatching the operation, which means the method invocation would not occur as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args, "extraArg"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the target method does not handle additional arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "post" to "get", which would attempt to retrieve a property instead of invoking a method, leading to incorrect functionality.

DONE.
