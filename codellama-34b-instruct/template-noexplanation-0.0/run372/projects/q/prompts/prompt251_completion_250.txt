  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This change will cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined`, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This change will cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined` if either `Q.longStackSupport` or `hasStacks` is false, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks && false
```
This change will cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined` if `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` are both true, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
