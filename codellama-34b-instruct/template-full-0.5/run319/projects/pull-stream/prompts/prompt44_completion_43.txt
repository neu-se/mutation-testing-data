  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the `ref` variable would not be called as a function, and the code would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ref
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have a `source` property, so the `read.source` line would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref` is not a function, so the `null` variable would not be called as a function, and the code would not work as intended.

DONE.
