  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.splice(0, 0, ...rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat(rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array, whereas `push` modifies the existing array.

DONE.
