  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peekLength()` method to return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the next operation in the `other` delta, which would cause the `length` variable to be incremented by one more than it should be, leading to an incorrect result.
