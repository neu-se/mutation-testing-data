  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.x
```
This would result in a different behavior because in the original code, the object is not accessed, whereas in this modified code, the object is accessed, which could potentially lead to a different value being passed to the `isPromiseAlike` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++object
```
This would result in a different behavior because in the original code, no operation is performed on the object, whereas in this modified code, the object is incremented, which could potentially lead to a different result when passed to the `isPromiseAlike` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in a different behavior because in the original code, the object is not accessed as an array, whereas in this modified code, the object is accessed as an array, which could potentially lead to a different value being passed to the `isPromiseAlike` function.

DONE.
