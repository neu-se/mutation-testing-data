  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is not set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of the `deprecated` option, which could cause the function to return a different set of timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = Object.keys(timezones).length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` option to the number of timezones, which could cause the function to return a different set of timezones.

DONE.
