  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `sink(null)` is a function call with only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `sink(undefined)` is a function call with only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `source` is a function that takes two arguments, but the replacement code fragment `sink(acc)` is a function call with only one argument.

DONE.
