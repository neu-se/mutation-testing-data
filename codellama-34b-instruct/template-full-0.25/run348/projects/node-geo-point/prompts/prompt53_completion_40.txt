  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is added to the `Δλ` value, which would cause the bearing calculation to be offset by 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` value is multiplied by 2, which would cause the bearing calculation to be doubled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is subtracted from the `Δλ` value, which would cause the bearing calculation to be offset by -180 degrees.

DONE.
