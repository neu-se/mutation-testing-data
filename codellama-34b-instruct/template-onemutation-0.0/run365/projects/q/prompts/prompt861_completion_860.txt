  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout !== void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timeout` is equal to `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not equal to `undefined`. This change would cause the `timeout` parameter to always be considered, even if it is not provided, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `timeout` feature.

DONE.
