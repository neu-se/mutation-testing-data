  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.get(key)` method returns the value stored at the given key in the database, whereas the original code fragment `key` simply returns the key itself. This would cause the `update` method to update the value stored at the given key with the result of the `updater` function, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.get(key).val` expression returns the value stored at the given key in the database, whereas the original code fragment `key` simply returns the key itself. This would cause the `update` method to update the value stored at the given key with the result of the `updater` function, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).val.toString()
```
This would result
