  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `retain` property to be incremented by `firstLeft`, which would change the behavior of the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the `retain` property to be multiplied by `firstLeft`, which would change the behavior of the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would cause the `retain` property to be divided by `firstLeft`, which would change the behavior of the `compose` method.

DONE.
