  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run at all, potentially causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra iteration, potentially causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
