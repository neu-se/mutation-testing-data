  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which can be used to test the `query` method's behavior when the `rules` array is modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.query(path, verb, ctx) === true)
```
This code fragment filters the `rules` array to only include rules that return `true` when the `query` method is called with the given `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments. This can be used to test the `query` method's behavior when the `rules` array contains only a subset of the original rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.query(path, verb, ctx))
```
This code fragment maps the `rules` array to an array of `boolean` values, where each value represents the result of calling the `query
