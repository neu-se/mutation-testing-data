  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```"&"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` operator would be interpreted as a bitwise AND operator, which would likely cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```"|"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` operator would be interpreted as a bitwise OR operator, which would also likely cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```"+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` operator would be interpreted as a plus operator, which would likely cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
