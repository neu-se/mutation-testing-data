  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` would be called immediately, rather than when the timeout expires.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` would be called immediately, rather than when the timeout expires, and the promise would be resolved with the error, rather than rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify` would be called immediately, rather than when the timeout expires, and the promise would be notified with the error, rather than rejected.

DONE.
