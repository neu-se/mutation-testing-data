  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the square root operation `Math.sqrt`, which is replaced with the number 2. This would cause the entire expression to evaluate to 2, instead of the complex number that the original code is expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the square root operation `Math.sqrt`, which is replaced with the number -2. This would cause the entire expression to evaluate to -2, instead of the complex number that the original code is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the square root operation `Math.sqrt`, which is replaced with the number PI. This would cause the entire expression to evaluate to a different complex number, because the square root of PI is not equal to the square root of 2.

DONE.
