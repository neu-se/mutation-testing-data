Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the measurement from the number of lines in the `line` Delta to the number of operations in the `line`, which could lead to incorrect handling of line breaks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it artificially increases the count of lines by one, potentially causing the predicate to be called one extra time than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the count of lines by one, which could lead to missing the last line when calling the predicate, thus altering the expected output.

DONE.
