  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `abortCb` callback is provided, it will be called with `abort` as an argument, otherwise it will be called with `null`. In the original code, the `abortCb` callback is always called with `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb ? abort : read
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `abortCb` callback is provided, it will be called with `abort` as an argument, otherwise it will be called with the result of `read(abort, cb)`. In the original code, the `abortCb` callback is always called with `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb ? abort : map.source(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `abortCb` callback is provided
