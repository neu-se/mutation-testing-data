  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    deferred.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `function (err, value) { deferred.resolve(value); }`, which would resolve the promise with the value, whereas this new code fragment would reject the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    deferred.resolve(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `function (err, value) { deferred.resolve(value); }`, which would resolve the promise with the value, whereas this new code fragment would resolve the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err, value) {
    deferred.notify(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `function (err, value) { deferred.resolve(
