  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is negated, causing the value to be subtracted instead of added.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is doubled, causing the result to be greater than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the value is changed to zero, causing the result to be different from the original.

DONE.
