  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` returns a new array with the elements in the opposite order, while `array_slice` returns a new array with the selected elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_sort
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_sort` returns a new array with the elements sorted, while `array_slice` returns a new array with the selected elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, while `array_slice` returns a new array with the selected elements.

DONE.
