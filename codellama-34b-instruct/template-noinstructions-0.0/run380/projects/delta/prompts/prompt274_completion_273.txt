  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation is not an insert, while this replacement checks if it is an insert. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation has a length greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the peeked operation is an insert. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the if-else statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the peeked operation has a length greater than 0, while this replacement checks if the peeked operation has a length of 0. This would cause the
