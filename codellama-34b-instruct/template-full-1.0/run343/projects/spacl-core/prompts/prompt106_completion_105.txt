  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.allow
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.allow` would always return `true`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.deny
```
This would result in different behavior because `policy.deny` would always return `false`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
