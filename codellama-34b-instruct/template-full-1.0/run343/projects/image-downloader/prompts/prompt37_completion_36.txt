  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'` instead of the default `'a'` (append), which would overwrite the file instead of appending to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'` (append) instead of the default `'w'` (write), which would allow the stream to be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'w' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'` (write) instead of the default `'a'` (append), which would overwrite the file instead of appending to it.

DONE.
