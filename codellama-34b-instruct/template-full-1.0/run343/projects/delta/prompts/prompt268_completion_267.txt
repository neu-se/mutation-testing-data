  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would make the code snippet always return null, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the NaN value would cause the code snippet to always return NaN, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would make the code snippet always return undefined, regardless of the values of the other variables.

DONE.
