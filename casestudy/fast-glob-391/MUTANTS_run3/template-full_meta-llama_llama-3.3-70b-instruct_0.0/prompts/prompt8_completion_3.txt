Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
negative, this._micromatchOptions
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` property is not explicitly set to `true`, which could lead to different pattern matching results if the original intention was to include dot files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
positive, this._micromatchOptions
```
This would result in different behavior because the `negative` patterns are being replaced with the `positive` patterns, effectively inverting the filtering logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
negative, { ...this._micromatchOptions, dot: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` property is explicitly set to `false`, which could lead to different pattern matching results if the original intention was to include dot files.

DONE.
