  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error when `exception` is null or undefined, while the new code would silently handle the null case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code throws an error when `exception` is null or undefined, while the new code would silently handle the undefined case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("This is a different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rejects the promise with the given `exception` object, while the new code would reject the promise with a different error message.

DONE.
