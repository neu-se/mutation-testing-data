  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key]
```
This change would cause the `get` method to behave like `set` and always return a promise that resolves to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This change would cause the `get` method to behave like `delete` and always return a promise that resolves to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [key, value]
```
This change would cause the `get` method to behave like `post` and always return a promise that resolves to `value`.

DONE.
