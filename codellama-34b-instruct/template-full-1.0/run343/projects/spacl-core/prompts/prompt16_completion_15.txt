  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\^\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` character is not escaped, which would cause the regex to match any character except for a newline, instead of the intended behavior of matching the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+verter$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verter` string is not escaped, which would cause the regex to match any string that contains `verter`, regardless of its position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match any string that starts with the previous regex, regardless of its position in the string.

DONE.
