Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `cork` method instead of the `uncork` method, which would prevent the write stream from flushing any buffered data, potentially leading to data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write();
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `write` method without any data to write, which would not perform the intended operation of preparing the stream for writing, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the write stream immediately, preventing any further writes and potentially causing errors if there are still pending writes in the queue.

DONE.
