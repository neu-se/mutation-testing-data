  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is `true`, while this code fragment uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to perform a bitwise AND operation on `onAbort` and `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === false ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is `true`, while this code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`) to check if `onAbort` is truthy and `abort` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && (abort === null ? null : abort)
```
