  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code takes into account the padding of the `asesh` function, while this replacement would always return 0, regardless of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code handles the case where the argument is equal to 0, while this replacement would return Infinity for any argument, including 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a new instance of the `Complex` class, while this replacement would return `undefined`.

DONE.
