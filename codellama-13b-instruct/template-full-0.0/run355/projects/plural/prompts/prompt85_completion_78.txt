  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple string comparison, while the new code fragment is a more complex regular expression that matches multiple words. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail in unexpected ways, as the regular expression may not cover all possible cases.
