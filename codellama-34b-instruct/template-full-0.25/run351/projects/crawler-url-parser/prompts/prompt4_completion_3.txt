  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the code to execute the `if` block even if the URL does not contain illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` part of the expression would always evaluate to `false`, causing the code to execute the `if` block even if the URL does contain illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` part of the expression would always evaluate to `true`, causing the code to execute the `if` block even if
