  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that is called when the current stream is exhausted, but `nextStream()` would call the function immediately, rather than when the current stream is exhausted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read` is a variable that is used to store the current stream, but `nextStream` is a function that returns a new stream, so assigning it to `_read` would cause the current stream to be overwritten with the new stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = values(nextStream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` is a function that returns an array of values from a stream, but `nextStream` is a function that returns a new stream, so `values(nextStream)` would return an array of values from the new stream, rather than the current stream.
