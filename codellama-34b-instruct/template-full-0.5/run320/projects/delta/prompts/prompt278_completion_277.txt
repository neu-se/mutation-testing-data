  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one higher than it should be, potentially causing the `newline` character to be included in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one lower than it should be, potentially causing the `newline` character to be excluded from the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 2` would cause the `start` variable to be two higher than it should be, potentially causing
