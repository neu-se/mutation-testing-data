  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, and the code would execute the alternative branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check if the real part of the complex number is greater than 0, rather than checking if it is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to 0, rather than checking if it is equal to 0.

DONE.
