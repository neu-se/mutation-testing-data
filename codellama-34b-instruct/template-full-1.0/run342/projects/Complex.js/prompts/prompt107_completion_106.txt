  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a new instance of Complex with real and imaginary parts equal to zero, regardless of the input parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error whenever the input parameters do not match one of the expected cases, instead of returning Complex.NAN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return Complex.NAN when the input parameters do not match one of the expected cases, instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
