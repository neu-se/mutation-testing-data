  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator would flip the sign of the result, causing the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos^2
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function would be squared, causing the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would be used instead of the cosine function, causing the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
