  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue` is an array, and `pop()` is a method that removes the last element of the array. In the original code, `laterQueue` is not used, so this change would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

DONE.
