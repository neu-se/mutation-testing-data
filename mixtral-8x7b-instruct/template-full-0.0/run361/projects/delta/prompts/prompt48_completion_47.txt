 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `embedType` is falsy, allowing operations with different embed types to be considered equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType && embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it now requires `embedType` to be truthy, which could cause an exception if `embedType` is an empty string or other falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
embedType !== b.constructor.name
