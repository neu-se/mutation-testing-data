  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` is a function that takes an error object as an argument, and calling it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, and passing it to `self.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error than the one that was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.resolve` is a function that takes a value as an argument, and passing an error object to it would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value, rather than being rejected with the error.

DONE.
