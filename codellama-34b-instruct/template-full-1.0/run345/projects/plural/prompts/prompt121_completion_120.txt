  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not add a plural 's' to words ending in 'ics', but the new code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace('ics', 'ies') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not replace 'ics' with 'ies', but the new code would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace('ics', 'ies') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not replace 'ics' with 'ies', but the new code would.

DONE.
