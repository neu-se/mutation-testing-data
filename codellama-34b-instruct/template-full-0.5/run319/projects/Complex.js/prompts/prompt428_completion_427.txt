  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10^1 = 10` instead of `10^0 = 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `0` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10^0 = 1` instead of `10^1 = 10`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator would always return `0` if `places` is falsy, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return `10^0
