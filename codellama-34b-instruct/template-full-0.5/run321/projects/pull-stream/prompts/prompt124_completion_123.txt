  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` counter instead of incrementing it, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `max` value instead of the `i` counter, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `i` counter plus one instead of the `i` counter itself, which could cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
