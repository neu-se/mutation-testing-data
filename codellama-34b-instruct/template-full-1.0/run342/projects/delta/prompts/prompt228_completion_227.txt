  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x = Math.max(2, 5);
```
This would result in different behavior because the maximum value of 2 and 5 is 5, whereas the minimum value is 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x = Math.pow(2, 5);
```
This would result in different behavior because the power of 2 to the 5th power is 32, whereas the minimum value is 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x = Math.sin(2) + Math.cos(5);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine of 2 and the cosine of 5 are 0.9092974268256817 and 0.20791179025472833, respectively, whereas the minimum value is 2.

DONE.
