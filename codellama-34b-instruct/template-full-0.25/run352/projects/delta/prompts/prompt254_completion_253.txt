  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume one operation from the other iterator, regardless of the current operation being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consume the entire remaining length of the other iterator, regardless of the current operation being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume a different number of operations from the other iterator depending on the value of `thisOp.retain`.

DONE.
