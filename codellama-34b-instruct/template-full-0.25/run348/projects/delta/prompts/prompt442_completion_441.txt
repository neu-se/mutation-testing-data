  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to calculate the length of the substring, and adding 1 to it would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to calculate the length of the substring, and subtracting 1 from it would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is used to calculate the length of the substring, and using it instead of `offset` would result in a different substring being returned.

DONE.
