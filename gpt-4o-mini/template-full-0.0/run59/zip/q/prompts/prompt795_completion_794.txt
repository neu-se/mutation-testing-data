Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` would cause the promise to resolve with `null` instead of being treated as a no-op, potentially leading to unexpected results in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` would cause the promise to resolve with a boolean value, which could alter the expected data type in subsequent `.then()` handlers, leading to logic errors in the promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because while `undefined` is similar to `void 0`, it can lead to different interpretations in some contexts, especially if the promise is expected to resolve with a specific value or type, potentially causing issues in the promise chain.

DONE.
