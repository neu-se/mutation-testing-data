  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not called in the original code fragment, which could lead to different results in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is not called in the original code fragment, which could lead to different results in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).retain()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method is not called in the original code fragment, which could lead to different results in certain scenarios.

DONE.
