  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more operations to iterate over, while `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is a boolean value. In the original code, the function is called without parentheses, which means it is not being called as a function, but rather as a property accessor.

DONE.
