  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a function that clears a timer set with `setInterval`, while `clearTimeout` is a function that clears a timer set with `setTimeout`. Using `clearInterval` in this context would cause the timer to continue running indefinitely, leading to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` sets a new timer, while `clearTimeout` clears an existing timer. Using `setTimeout` in this context would cause the timer to be reset, potentially leading to an infinite loop of timers being set and cleared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
