  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because this line would create a recursive call to the `test` function, potentially causing infinite loops or crashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data != null
```
This would result in different behavior because this line would check if the `data` argument is not null, rather than checking if it is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because this line would check if the result of the `test.test(data)` call is equal to `true`, rather than checking if the result is a function.

DONE.
