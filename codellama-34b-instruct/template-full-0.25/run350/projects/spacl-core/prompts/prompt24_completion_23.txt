  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(max > 0) && any`, which would be different from the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `any`, so the expression would be evaluated as `max > 0 || !any`, which would be different from the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || max < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if either `max > 0` or `max < 0` is true, which would be different from the original expression.

DONE.
