  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation being performed on the object to `put` instead of `get`, which would attempt to set a property with the given key and value instead of retrieving the property's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"has", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation being performed on the object to `has` instead of `get`, which would check if the property with the given key exists on the object instead of retrieving its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the operation being performed on the object to `delete` instead of `get`, which would delete the property with the given key instead of retrieving its value.

DONE.
