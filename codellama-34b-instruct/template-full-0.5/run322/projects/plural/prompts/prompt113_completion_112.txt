  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var clothes = ['trouser', 'pant', 'pantie', 'clothe', 'dress']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes" and not "dress".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var clothes = ['trouser', 'pant', 'pantie', 'clothe', 'shirt']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes" and not "shirt".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var clothes = ['trouser', 'pant', 'pantie', 'clothe', 'jacket']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the word "clothes" and not "jacket".

DONE.
