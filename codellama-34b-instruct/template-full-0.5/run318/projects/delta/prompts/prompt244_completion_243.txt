  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would return the next operation in the iterator, which may not be the same as the operation that was previously returned by `thisIter.next()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation in the other iterator, which may not be the same as the operation that was previously returned by `thisIter.next()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid operation, and would cause an error when attempting to apply it to the delta.

DONE.
