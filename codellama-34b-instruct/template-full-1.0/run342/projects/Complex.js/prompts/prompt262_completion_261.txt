  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is dividing the two numbers, whereas this replacement multiplies them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is multiplying the two numbers, whereas this replacement divides them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is multiplying the two numbers in a different order, whereas this replacement divides the numbers in a different order.

DONE.
