  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object, and therefore does not have a `drain` method. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `drain` on `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and therefore does not have a `drain` method. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `drain` on `{}`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and therefore does not have a `drain` method. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `drain` on `[]`.

DONE.
