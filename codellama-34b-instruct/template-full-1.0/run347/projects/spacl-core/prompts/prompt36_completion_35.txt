  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().filter(s => s)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would remove any empty strings from the array, which could potentially change the outcome of the split operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(s => s.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would convert all characters to lowercase, which could potentially change the outcome of the split and reverse operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` function would reverse the array again, effectively cancelling out the previous `reverse` function.

DONE.
