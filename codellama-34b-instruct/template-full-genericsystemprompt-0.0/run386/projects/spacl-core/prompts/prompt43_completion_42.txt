  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with a different argument, which would cause the regular expression to be compiled differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be compiled with a different pattern, which would not match the same strings as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be compiled with a different pattern, which would not match the same strings as the original code.

DONE.
