 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would now attempt to perform addition on the `data`, which could cause the test to fail if `data` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would now attempt to call the `toUpperCase()` method on the `data`, which could cause the test to fail if `data` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would now apply the `mapper` function to the `data`, which could cause the test to fail if the `mapper` function is not idempotent.

DONE.
