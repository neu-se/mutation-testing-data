  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(this, ['load', 0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.apply()` method will call `this.emit` with the provided arguments, whereas the original code simply calls `this.emit` without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', '0');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the integer `0` as the second argument to `this.emit`, whereas this replacement passes the string `'0'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the integer `0` as the second argument to `this.emit`, whereas this replacement passes the integer `1`.

DONE.
