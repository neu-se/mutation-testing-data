 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would truncate the decimal part of the precision instead of keeping it to the specified number of decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 10
