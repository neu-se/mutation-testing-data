  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the key-value pair, while `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the key, which could cause the code to access a different key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key to uppercase, which could cause the code to access a different key-value pair.

DONE.
