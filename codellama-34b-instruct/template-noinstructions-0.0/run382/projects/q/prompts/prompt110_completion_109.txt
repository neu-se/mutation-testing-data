  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] == value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict equality, while this replacement checks for loose equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[i] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with a specific value, while this replacement checks for the absence of a value.

DONE.
