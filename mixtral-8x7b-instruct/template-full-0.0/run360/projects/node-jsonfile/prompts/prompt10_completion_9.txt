 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk and has different behavior than the original `JSON.parse`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Function` can also execute arbitrary code, similar to `eval`, and has different behavior than the original `JSON.parse`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('json-parse-better-errors').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `require('json-parse-better-errors').parse` throws a more informative error than the original `JSON.parse` when it encounters an error, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the test suite.

DONE.
