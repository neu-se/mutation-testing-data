Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `pull` with the first argument `ref[0]` twice instead of using `ref[1]`, which could lead to incorrect results when the second argument is expected to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the second argument instead of the expected `ref[1]`, which may cause the function to behave incorrectly or throw an error if `null` is not handled properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the second argument instead of the expected `ref[1]`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the function relies on the presence of a valid second argument.

DONE.
