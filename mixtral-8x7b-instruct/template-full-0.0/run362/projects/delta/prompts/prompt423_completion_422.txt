 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min()` function call is removed, causing the `nextType === 'delete'` branch to always execute, even when the length of the deleted operation is greater than the difference between the index and the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operation is replaced with addition, causing the `index` to always increase instead of decrease when a delete operation is encountered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
length * index - offset
