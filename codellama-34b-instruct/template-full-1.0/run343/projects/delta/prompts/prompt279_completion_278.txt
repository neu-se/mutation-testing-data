  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input, while `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input. This would change the way the length of the operation is calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the input, which would change the way the length of the operation is calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` returns the input to the power of a given value, which would change the way the length of the operation is calculated.

DONE.
