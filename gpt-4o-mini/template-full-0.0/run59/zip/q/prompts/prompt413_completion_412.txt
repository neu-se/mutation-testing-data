Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify strings as promise-like objects, leading to false positives when checking if an object is promise-like.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider arrays as promise-like objects, ignoring other objects that may have a `then` method, thus failing to identify valid promise-like objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` as a promise-like object, which is incorrect, as `null` does not have a `then` method and should not be considered promise-like.

DONE.
