  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx => undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a simple comparison, while the new code fragment uses the `=>` arrow function syntax to create an arrow function that always returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if `ctx` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ctx` is `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if `ctx` is falsy (i.e., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, etc.).

DONE.
