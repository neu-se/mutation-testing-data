  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.transformPosition
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `transformPosition` method of `other` instead of `this`, potentially altering the behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete other.transformPosition
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `transformPosition` method of `other`, potentially altering the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof other.transformPosition
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the type of the `transformPosition` method of `other` instead of evaluating to a function or method name, potentially altering the behavior of the method.

DONE.
