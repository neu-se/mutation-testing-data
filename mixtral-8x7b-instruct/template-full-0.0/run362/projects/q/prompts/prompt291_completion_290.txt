 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function is intended to be used to reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, causing a different outcome than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is used to send progress updates for the promise, not to reject it. Using it instead of `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Rejecting the promise'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with a specific reason, it would reject it with a generic error message. This could cause issues in the error handling code that expects a specific reason for the rejection.

DONE.
