  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because now the abort callback would be called with `null` instead of `abort`, and the onAbort callback would not be called at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because now the abort callback would be called with `abort` instead of `null`, and the onAbort callback would be called with `onAbort` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because now the abort callback would be called with `null` instead of `abort`, and the onAbort callback would not be called at all.

DONE.
