  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `op` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `op`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `op` is 0, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `op` by 2, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `op` is 0, and vice versa.

DONE.
