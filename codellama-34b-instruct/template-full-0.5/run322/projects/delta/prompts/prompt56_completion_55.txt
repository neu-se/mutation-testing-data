  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property is a list, and `this.ops.length - 1` would return the index of the last element in the list, rather than the list itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops[0]` would return the first element in the `ops` list, rather than the list itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.slice(1)` would return a new list containing all elements of `ops` except for the first one, rather than the list itself.

DONE.
