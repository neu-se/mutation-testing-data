Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + path
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the `path` by prepending a forward slash, which may lead to incorrect policy queries if the original path does not start with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + '/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a wildcard to the `path`, potentially allowing access to more resources than intended, as it changes the specificity of the path being queried.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the `path` to uppercase, which may cause mismatches in policy queries if the original paths are case-sensitive.

DONE.
