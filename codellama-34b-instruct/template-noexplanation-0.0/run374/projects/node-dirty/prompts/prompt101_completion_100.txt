  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == null
```
This change will cause the code to treat `null` and `undefined` values the same way, which may be desirable in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This change will cause the code to only treat `null` values the same way, which may be desirable in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This change will cause the code to treat any value that is not `undefined` the same way, which may be desirable in some cases.

DONE.
