  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `iter.next(1).attributes` expression would be evaluated before the `||` operator, which would cause the `line` variable to be assigned the attributes of the next operation in the iterator, rather than the attributes of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `iter.next().attributes` expression would be evaluated before the `||` operator, which would cause the `line` variable to be assigned the attributes of the next operation in the iterator, rather than the attributes of the current operation.
