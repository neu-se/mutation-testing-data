 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(b, a) => Math.atan(b / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calculates the arctangent of the ratio of `b` and `a`, without considering the quadrant, which can lead to incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` only calculates the arctangent of a single number, not considering the sign of both `b` and `a`, which can lead to incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(b, a) => Math.atan(b / a) * (180 / Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the arctangent of the ratio of `b` and `a`, then converts the result from radians to degrees, which is not
