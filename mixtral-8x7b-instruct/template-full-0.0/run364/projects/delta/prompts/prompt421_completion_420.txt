 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` value will no longer be adjusted based on the length of the deleted operations, potentially causing incorrect position transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` value will always be adjusted based on the length of the next operation, even if it's an insertion or not a delete operation, potentially causing incorrect position transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` value will be adjusted by the negative length of the next operation, potentially causing incorrect position transformations and even creating an infinite loop if the next operation is a delete.

DONE.
