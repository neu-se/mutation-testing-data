 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of running the `task` after all other tasks have been run, it would add an empty array to the `laterQueue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the number `42` to the `laterQueue`, instead of the provided `task`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
