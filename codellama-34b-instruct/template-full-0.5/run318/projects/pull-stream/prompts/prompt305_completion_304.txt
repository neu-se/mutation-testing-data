  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called twice when `ended` is true, whereas the original code only calls the callback once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called when `ended` is false, whereas the original code only calls the callback when `ended` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called when `ended` is false, whereas the original code only calls the callback when `ended` is true.

DONE.
