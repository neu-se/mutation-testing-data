Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of the `exception` variable instead of its string representation, which would not correctly identify `StopIteration` exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method on `Object.prototype.toString`, which may not return the expected string representation for `StopIteration`, leading to incorrect handling of the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `toString` method on the `exception` object, which may not return the expected "[object StopIteration]" string, thus failing to correctly identify the exception type.

DONE.
