  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call().then(function () {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply().then(function () {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `callback` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
