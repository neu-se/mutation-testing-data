  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this._data.remove`. This would result in different behavior because `remove` is not a method of the `Map` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this._data.erase`. This would result in different behavior because `erase` is not a method of the `Map` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this._data.clear`. This would result in different behavior because `clear` removes all elements from the `Map`, whereas the original code fragment only removes the value associated with the given key.

DONE.
