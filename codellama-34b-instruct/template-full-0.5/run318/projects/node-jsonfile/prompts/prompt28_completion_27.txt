  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldNotThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because `shouldNotThrow` is a different variable than `shouldThrow`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is when `shouldNotThrow` is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `shouldThrow`, which could cause the code to behave differently depending on the value of `shouldThrow`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `shouldThrow`, which could cause the code to behave differently depending on the value of `shouldThrow`.

DONE.
