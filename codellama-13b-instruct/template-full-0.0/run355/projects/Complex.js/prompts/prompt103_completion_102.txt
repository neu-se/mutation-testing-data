  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is used instead of `>`, which would allow for the possibility of `plus + minus` being equal to 0, whereas the original code only allows for `plus + minus` to be greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of `>`, which would allow for the possibility of `plus + minus` being less than 0, whereas the original code only allows for `plus + minus` to be greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `>`, which would allow for the possibility of `plus + minus` being equal to 0, whereas the original code only allows for `plus + minus` to be greater than
