  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `p.stack` property, which is a string, and the new code fragment is using the `length` property of the string, which is a number. This would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to behave differently when concatenating the stack traces of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `p.stack` property, which is a string, and the new code fragment is using the `toUpperCase` method of the string, which would convert the string to uppercase. This would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to behave differently when concatenating the stack traces of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the
