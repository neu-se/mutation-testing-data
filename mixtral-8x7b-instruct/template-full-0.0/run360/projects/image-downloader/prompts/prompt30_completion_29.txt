 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.startsWith.call(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the empty string starts with the `url` string, which would always be true. This would bypass the conditional check and use the `http` module regardless of the URL scheme.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https:'.indexOf(url) === 0
