  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the number of characters in the iterator's current operation, which may not accurately reflect the length of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the total number of operations in the iterator's operations array, rather than the number of characters in the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the number of characters in the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the current operation in the this iterator.

DONE.
