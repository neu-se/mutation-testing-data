  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could lead to unexpected results in the diff algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the length of the string, instead of only when the iterator is at the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, which would cause the loop to never iterate, leading to an empty diff.

DONE.
