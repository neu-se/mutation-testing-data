  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` would be a different value than `b`, and therefore would cause the resulting `Complex` object to have a different real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - 1` would be a different value than `b`, and therefore would cause the resulting `Complex` object to have a different real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * 2` would be a different value than `b`, and therefore would cause the resulting `Complex` object to have a different real part.

DONE.
