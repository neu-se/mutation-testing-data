  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex` constructor to be called with the arguments in the reverse order, which would result in a different complex number being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'], a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex` constructor to be called with the arguments in the correct order, but with the `z['re']` argument being the first argument, which would result in a different complex number being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex` constructor to be called with the sum of the `z['re']` and `a` arguments, which would result in a different complex number being created.

DONE.
