  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator will add 1 to the value of `data` before passing it to the `test` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` operator will divide the value of `data` by 2 before passing it to the `test` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator will multiply the value of `data` by 2 before passing it to the `test` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
