  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones.length` would return the number of elements in the `timezones` array, while `timezone` would return the value of the `timezone` variable, which is a string representing the name of the timezone.

DONE.
