  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.geometry
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the presence of the `type` property in the `point` object, while this new code checks the presence of a `geometry` property in the `point` object, which may not be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the presence of the `coordinates` property in the `point` object, while this new code checks the presence of a `coordinates[0]` property in the `point` object, which may not be present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.get('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the value of the `type` property in the `point` object, while this new code uses the `get` method to retrieve the value of the `type` property, which may return a different value.
