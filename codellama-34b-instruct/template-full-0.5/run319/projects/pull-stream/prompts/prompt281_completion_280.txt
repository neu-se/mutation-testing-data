  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a reference to a function, while `mapper(data)` is a function call that applies the `mapper` function to the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper[data]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a reference to a function, while `mapper[data]` is a reference to a property of the `mapper` object with a key of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.map(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `mapper` is a reference to a function, while `mapper.map(data)` is a function call that applies the `map` method of the `mapper` object to the `data` argument.

DONE.
