  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `process.domain` is defined, regardless of whether it is actually the current domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `process.domain` is both defined and equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `process.domain` is defined, regardless of its value.

DONE.
