  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/criterion/, 'criteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a singular-plural pair to the internal list of rules, while the modified code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "criterion" and replace it with "criteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('Corpus', 'Corpora')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not contain the word "Corpus" or "Corpora", while the modified code fragment adds a new singular-plural pair to the internal list of rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/bacterium/, 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `addRule` function to add a singular-plural pair to the internal list of rules, while the modified code fragment uses a regular expression to
