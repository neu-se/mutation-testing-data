  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called with a different event name, potentially causing the code that listens for the `'write_close'` event to not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('write_close'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called with a different event name and a new error object, potentially causing the code that listens for the `'error'` event to be executed with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called with a different event name and a new error object, potentially causing the code that listens for the `'write_close'` event to be executed with a different error message.

DONE.
