  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would now be comparing the `delete` property of `nextOp` to the string `'string'`, which would always evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which would return a different value for the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would now be comparing the `delete` property of `nextOp` to the string `'number'`, which would always evaluate to `false`. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which would return a different value for the `next` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete === 0
```
