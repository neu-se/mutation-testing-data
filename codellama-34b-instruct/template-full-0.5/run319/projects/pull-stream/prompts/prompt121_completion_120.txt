  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err);
  } else {
    cb(null, data);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(acc, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err);
  } else {
    cb(null, data);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` function with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the `drain` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(acc, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err);
