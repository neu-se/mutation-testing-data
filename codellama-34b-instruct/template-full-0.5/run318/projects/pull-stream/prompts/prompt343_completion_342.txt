  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` returns a boolean value, but `abort || false` returns a boolean value that is always `true` if `abort` is truthy, and `false` otherwise. This change would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` returns a boolean value, but `!abort` returns the opposite boolean value. This change would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` returns a boolean value, but `ab
