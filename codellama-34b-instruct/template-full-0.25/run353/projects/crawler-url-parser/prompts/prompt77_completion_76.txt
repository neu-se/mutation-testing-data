  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would modify the `embedBaseUrlStr` variable, which is used in the `parse` function to determine the base URL for the URL being parsed. By removing the `https?:\/\/` pattern from the beginning of the string, the `parse` function would not be able to correctly identify the base URL, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the `embedBaseUrlStr` variable into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the delimiter. By taking the first element of the array, the `parse` function would not be able to correctly identify the base URL, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\
