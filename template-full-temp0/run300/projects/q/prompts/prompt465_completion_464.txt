  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to the `promise` object, rather than the index of the `promise` object in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `promise` object is not in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if it is at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `promise` object is in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than checking if it is at a specific index.
