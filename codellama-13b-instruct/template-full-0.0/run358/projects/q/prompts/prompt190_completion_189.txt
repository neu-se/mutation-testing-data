  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second element of the `attempt2` array, which is the line number, instead of the third element, which is the column number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the fourth element of the `attempt2` array, which is the column number, instead of the third element, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the fifth element of the `attempt2` array, which is the file name, instead of the third element, which is the line number.

DONE.
