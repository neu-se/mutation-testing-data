  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` is a complex number object, and `isNaN` is not a property of the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both `z` and `this` are infinite, whereas the original code only checks if `this` is infinite.

DONE.
