  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the first op in the other delta is not a retain op, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the first op in the other delta is not an insert op, which would result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if the first op in the other delta is not a retain op with a length greater than firstLeft, which would result in an infinite loop.

DONE.
