  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject` instead of `deferred.resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid value"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include an error message, and the new code fragment would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include a notification, and the new code fragment would cause the promise to be notified with the value.

DONE.
