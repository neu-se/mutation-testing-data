  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is not an object, while this replacement checks if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it has a property called `delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it has a property called `delete` that is undefined.

DONE.
