 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the condition, causing the loop to continue when the current operation is an insert and the other iterator has an insert, and exit when the current operation is not an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop continue only when the current operation is a delete, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the loop continue only when the current operation is a retain, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
