  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the UTF-16 encoding would be used instead of UTF-8, which could cause issues with non-ASCII characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the ASCII encoding would be used instead of UTF-8, which could cause issues with non-ASCII characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf7'
```
This would result in different behavior because the UTF-7 encoding would be used instead of UTF-8, which could cause issues with non-ASCII characters.

DONE.
