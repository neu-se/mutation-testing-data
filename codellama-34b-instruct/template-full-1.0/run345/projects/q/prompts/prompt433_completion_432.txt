  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is truthy, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is falsy, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `trackUnhandledRejections` is strictly equal to `true`, which would cause the `trackRejection` function to be called, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
