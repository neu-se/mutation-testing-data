  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would return a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would return a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` would return a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would return a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would return a pending promise that would never be fulfilled or rejected, whereas `Q.resolve` would return a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
