  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be used instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be increased by 180 degrees, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be decreased by 180 degrees, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
