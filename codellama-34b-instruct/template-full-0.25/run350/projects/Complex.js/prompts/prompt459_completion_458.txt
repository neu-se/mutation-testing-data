  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] !== 0 || this['re'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is not at the infinity pole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] === 0 || this['re'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is at the zero pole of the Riemann sphere, while the new code fragment checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole or the zero pole
