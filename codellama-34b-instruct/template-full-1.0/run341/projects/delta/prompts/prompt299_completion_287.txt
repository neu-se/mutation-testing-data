  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("not a line")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs "line" to the console, while this modified code fragment logs "not a line" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error("line")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs "line" to the console with a severity of "debug," while this modified code fragment logs "line" with a severity of "error."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info("not a line")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs "line" to the console with a severity of "debug," while this modified code fragment logs "not a line" with a severity of "info."

DONE.
