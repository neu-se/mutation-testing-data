  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` when `a` is `NaN`, instead of returning `0` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `NaN` when `b` is `NaN`, instead of returning `0` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1, instead of the absolute value of the number.

DONE.
