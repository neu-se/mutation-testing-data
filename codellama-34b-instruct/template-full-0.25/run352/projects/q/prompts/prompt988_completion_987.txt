  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `get`, which would cause the function to return a promise that resolves with the value of the `name` property of the `object`, rather than the value returned by the `name` method of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is passed as the third argument to the `post` method, which would cause the function to return a promise that resolves with the value returned by the `name` method of the `object`, but with the first argument to the method set to `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, function() { return 1; }]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is passed as the
