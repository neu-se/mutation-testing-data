  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude of the `point` instead of the `point` itself, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `point` as the first argument and `this` as the second argument, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the longitude of the `point` as the first argument and `this` as the second argument, which could cause the `calculateDistance` method to return a different value.

DONE.
