 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the method to return an unhandled `"POST"` operation instead of the intended `"post"` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
symbol("post")
