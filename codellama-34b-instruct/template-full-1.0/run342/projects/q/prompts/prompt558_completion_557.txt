  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.value
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the argument is an object, but in this change, it is the value of that object. This could cause issues if the function being called is expecting an object and not a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the argument is an object, but in this change, it is the first element of an array. This could cause issues if the function being called is expecting an object and not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the argument is an object, but in this change, it is a number. This could cause issues if the function being called is expecting an object and not a number.

DONE.
