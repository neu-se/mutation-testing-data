  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Dummy error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to emit an error event with a dummy error message, which would trigger the error event handler in the constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to emit a load event with a value of 100, which would cause the _load() function to be called and the database to be loaded with 100 rows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to emit a read_close event, which would cause the _readStream to be closed and the database to be loaded with the rows that have been read.

DONE.
