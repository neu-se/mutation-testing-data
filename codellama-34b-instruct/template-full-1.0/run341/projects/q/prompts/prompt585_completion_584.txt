  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will create a rejected promise, whereas `Q.done` will create a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch("when", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` will schedule a task to be executed in the next tick, whereas `Q.done` will resolve the promise immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.set("get", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set` will set the value of a property in a future turn, whereas `Q.done` will resolve the promise immediately.
