  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length === 0` is always false, whereas `!length` is true when `length` is 0 or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length !== 0` is always true, whereas `!length` is false when `length` is 0 or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length >= 0` is always true, whereas `!length` is false when `length` is negative.

DONE.
