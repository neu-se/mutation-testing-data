Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting `stackLine` to a string explicitly may lead to unexpected results if `stackLine` is not a string, potentially causing the regex to fail to match correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would extract only the part of `stackLine` before the first colon, which would not match the expected format for file names and line numbers, leading to incorrect parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(":", ";")
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the first colon with a semicolon would alter the expected format of the stack trace, causing the regex to fail to match the intended file name and line number pattern.

DONE.
