 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `ops` array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.slice(this.index)[0]
