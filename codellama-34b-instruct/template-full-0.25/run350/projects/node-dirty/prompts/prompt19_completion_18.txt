  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable is not an array, and the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call the `push` method on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` variable is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
