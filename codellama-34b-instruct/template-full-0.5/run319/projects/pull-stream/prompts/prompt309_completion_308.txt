  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| false` part would always return `false`, making the entire expression always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& true` part would always return `true`, making the entire expression always evaluate to `true`, even if the `test` function returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` part would always return `false`, making the entire expression always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns `true`.

DONE.
