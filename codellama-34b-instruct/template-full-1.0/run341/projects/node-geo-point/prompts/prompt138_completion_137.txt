  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this.longitude`. This would result in a function that always returns the same latitude as the input longitude, regardless of the input latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `-this.longitude`. This would result in a function that always returns the opposite longitude as the input longitude, regardless of the input latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `this.latitude + 1`. This would result in a function that always returns a slightly different latitude as the input longitude, regardless of the input latitude.

DONE.
