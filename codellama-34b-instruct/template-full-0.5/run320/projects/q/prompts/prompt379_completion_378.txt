  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a no-op function, whereas `callback` is a reference to a function that may have side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { return x + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function (x) { return x + 1; }` is a function that returns a different value than `callback` for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (x) { throw new Error("test"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function (x) { throw new Error("test"); }` is a function that throws an error, whereas `callback` may not throw an error.

DONE.
