  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, whereas `includes` checks if the string contains the substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if the substring is present in the string, and `=== 0` checks if the substring is at the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if the string matches the given regular expression, and the regular expression `pageurl_path` would match the string `linkurl_path` if it starts with `pageurl_path`.

DONE.
