  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `a` instead of the correct value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the sum of `a` and `b` instead of the correct value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the sine of `b` instead of the correct value of `b`.

DONE.
