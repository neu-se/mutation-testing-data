 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `close` method with an empty function, preventing the actual closing behavior from being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = this._load;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `close` method with the `_load` method, causing unexpected behavior when the `close` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => this.emit('error', new Error('Unexpected error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the 'error' event to be emitted with an error message, even if there is no actual error, potentially causing confusion and unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
