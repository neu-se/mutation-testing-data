  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles rejected promises, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles progress notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles fulfilled promises, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that handles progress notifications, whereas `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` are functions that handle fulfilled and rejected promises, respectively.

DONE.
