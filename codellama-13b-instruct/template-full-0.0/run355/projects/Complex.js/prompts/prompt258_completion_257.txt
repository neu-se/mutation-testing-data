  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0 and `b` is greater than 0. This would result in a different outcome for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both equal to 0. This would result in a different outcome for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `
