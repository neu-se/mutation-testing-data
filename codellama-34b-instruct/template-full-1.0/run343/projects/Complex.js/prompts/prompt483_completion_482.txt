  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']((this['re'] + this['im']))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this['isNaN']()` or `this['isFinite']()` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if the sum of `this['re']` and `this['im']` is finite. If the sum is infinite, this new code fragment would return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']((this['im'] + this['re']))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `this['isNaN']()` or `this['isFinite']()` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if the difference of `this['im']` and `this['re']` is finite. If the difference is infinite,
