  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost = function (object, name, args) {
    return Q(object).npost(name, args);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost = function (object, name, args) {
    return Q(object).npost(name, args).then(function () {
        return Q(object).npost(name, args);
    });
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `npost` method is called twice, which would cause the promise to resolve twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost = function (object, name, args) {
    return Q(object).npost(name, args).then(function () {
        return Q(object).npost(name, args).
