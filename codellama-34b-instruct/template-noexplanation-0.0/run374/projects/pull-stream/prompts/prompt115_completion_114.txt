  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which is different from the original code where `acc` is passed as the second argument. This change will test whether the test suite is able to handle unexpected values in the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which is different from the original code where `acc` is passed as the second argument. This change will test whether the test suite is able to handle unexpected values in the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code, which is `acc + 1`. This change will test whether the test suite is able to handle unexpected values in the `cb` function.

DONE.
