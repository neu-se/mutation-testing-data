Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than intended, potentially leading to data loss or incorrect state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively perform no deletion, which could lead to unexpected results if the intention was to delete a specific number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: -length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete a negative number of characters, which is nonsensical and could cause errors or unintended behavior in the application.

DONE.
