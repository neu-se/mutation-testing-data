  Sure, here are three options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with different code fragments that have different behavior:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length > 0` condition would be replaced with a check for a length greater than 1, which would cause a different branch of the `if` statement to be taken if the length is exactly 1.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length` expression would be negated, causing the condition to be true if the length is negative.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other.ops.length` expression would be replaced with a reference to a variable that has a different name, which could cause the mutation test to
