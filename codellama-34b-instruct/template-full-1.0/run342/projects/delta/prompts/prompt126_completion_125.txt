  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be equal to `start`, allowing the `while` loop to iterate one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be greater than `start`, causing the `while` loop to skip the first operation in `this.ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be greater than or equal to `start`, causing the `while` loop to include the first operation in `this.ops`.

DONE.
