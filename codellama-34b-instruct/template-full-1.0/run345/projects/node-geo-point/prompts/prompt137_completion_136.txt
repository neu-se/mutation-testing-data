  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.latitude += precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adjusts the `longitude` value, not the `latitude` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.precision += this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adjusts only the `latitude` value, not the `precision` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.longitude -= precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increases the `longitude` value, not decreases it.

DONE.
