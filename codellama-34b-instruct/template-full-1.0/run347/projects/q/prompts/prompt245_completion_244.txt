  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
variable
```
This would result in different behavior because variable is not a function and would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a function and would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a function and would not be called.

DONE.
