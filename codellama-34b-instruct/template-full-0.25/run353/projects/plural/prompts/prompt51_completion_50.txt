  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "es" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds "is".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "es" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds "ses".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + 'es' + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds "es" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds "seses".

DONE.
