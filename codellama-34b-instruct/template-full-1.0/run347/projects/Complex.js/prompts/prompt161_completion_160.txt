  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return a complex number, but instead it returns NaN (Not a Number), which is a different type of value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return a finite complex number, but instead it returns infinity, which is not a finite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is expected to return a non-zero complex number, but instead it returns a zero complex number, which is not the expected result.

DONE.
