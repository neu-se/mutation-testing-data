  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of the real part instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of 0 instead of the actual value.

DONE.
