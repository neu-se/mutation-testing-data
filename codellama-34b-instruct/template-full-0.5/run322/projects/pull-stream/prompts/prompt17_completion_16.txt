  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `pull` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment that passes all arguments to `pull`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument to the `pull` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment that passes all arguments to `pull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first and second arguments to the `pull` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment that passes all arguments to `pull`.

DONE.
