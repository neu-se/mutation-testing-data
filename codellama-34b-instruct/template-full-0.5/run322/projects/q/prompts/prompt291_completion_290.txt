  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is a different function than `deferred.reject`, and it would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a different function than `deferred.reject`, and it would cause the promise to notify progress instead of reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and it would cause an error to be thrown instead of rejecting the promise.

DONE.
