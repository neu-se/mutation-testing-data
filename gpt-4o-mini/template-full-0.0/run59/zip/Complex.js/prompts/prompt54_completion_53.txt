Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the real part of the complex number instead of the argument, which would lead to incorrect calculations when converting from polar to rectangular coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the argument with a constant value (90 degrees in radians), which would yield a fixed imaginary component regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the argument by adding 1, which would incorrectly shift the angle and lead to inaccurate results in the conversion from polar to rectangular coordinates.

DONE.
