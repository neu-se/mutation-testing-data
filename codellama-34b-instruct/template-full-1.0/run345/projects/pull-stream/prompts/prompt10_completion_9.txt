  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if `a` is a function with a length of 1, while the new code only checks if `a.length` is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if `a` is a function with a length of 1, while the new code checks if `a` is not null and its length is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if `a` is a function with a length of 1, while the new code checks if `a` is truthy and its length is equal to 1.

DONE.
