  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'e' sound to determine the plural form of a word, while the new code fragment uses the 'a' sound.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'o'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'e' sound to determine the plural form of a word, while the new code fragment uses the 'o' sound.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the 'e' sound to determine the plural form of a word, while the new code fragment uses the 'i' sound.

DONE.
