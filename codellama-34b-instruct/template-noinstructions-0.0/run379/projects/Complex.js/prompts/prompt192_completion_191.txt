  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and the code would be using the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to `b`, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from `b`, which would also change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
