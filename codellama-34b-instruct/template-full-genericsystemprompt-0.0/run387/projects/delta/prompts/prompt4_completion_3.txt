  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to always return the first argument, regardless of the values of the other arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to return the second argument if it is truthy, and the first argument otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to return the first argument if it is truthy, and the second argument otherwise.

DONE.
