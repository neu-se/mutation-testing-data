  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is a number. If `op.retain` is an object, the original code would return 1, but this replacement would return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is not null. If `op.retain` is an object, the original code would return 1, but this replacement would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, but this replacement checks if it is not undefined. If `op.retain` is
