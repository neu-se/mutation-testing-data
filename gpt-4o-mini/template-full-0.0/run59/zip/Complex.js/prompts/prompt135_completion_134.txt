Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either of the complex numbers is zero instead of checking for infinity, which would lead to incorrect handling of operations involving infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the first complex number is infinite and the second is zero, which would incorrectly allow the operation to proceed instead of returning infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if neither of the complex numbers is infinite, which would incorrectly allow the operation to proceed even if one of them is infinite, leading to potential errors in calculations.

DONE.
