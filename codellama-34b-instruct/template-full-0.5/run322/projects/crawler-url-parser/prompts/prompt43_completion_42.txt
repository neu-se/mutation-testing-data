  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` if the `currentUrlStr` parameter is undefined, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` if the `currentUrlStr` parameter is undefined, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a URL object with a protocol of "http:" if the `currentUrlStr` parameter is a string that starts with "http://", which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
