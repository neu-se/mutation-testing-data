  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which returns a function that calls `deferred.reject()` with the error as an argument. In contrast, this code calls `deferred.reject()` directly, which would result in the error being thrown instead of being passed to the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which returns a function that calls `deferred.reject()` with the error as an argument. In contrast, this code calls `deferred.resolve()` with the error as an argument, which would result in the error being treated as a resolved value instead of being passed to the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `
