  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this replacement only checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === false) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is falsy, while this replacement only checks if it is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while this replacement only checks if it is not falsy.

DONE.
