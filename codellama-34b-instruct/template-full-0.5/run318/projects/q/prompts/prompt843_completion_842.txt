  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would never be called, as the `ms` argument would always be zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would be called immediately, as the `ms` argument would always be negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would never be called, as the `ms` argument would always be `NaN`.

DONE.
