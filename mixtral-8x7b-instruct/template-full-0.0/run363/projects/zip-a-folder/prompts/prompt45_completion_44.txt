 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the directory to the current directory, instead of using the provided `src` path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the current working directory instead of the provided `src` path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when calling `zipArchive.directory(<PLACEHOLDER>, false)`, as it expects a string argument.

DONE.
