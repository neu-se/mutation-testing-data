  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would not pass the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first two arguments instead of all the arguments.

DONE.
