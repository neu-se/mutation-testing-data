  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` from the outer scope, while the replacement code fragment uses the value of `y` from the outer scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` from the outer scope, while the replacement code fragment uses the value of `a` from the outer scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` from the outer scope, while the replacement code fragment uses the value of `b` from the outer scope.

DONE.
