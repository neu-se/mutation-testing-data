  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.log(_a))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` would round the result of `Math.log` down to the nearest integer, which would cause the final result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(Math.log(_a))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` would round the result of `Math.log` up to the nearest integer, which would cause the final result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(Math.log(_a))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` would round the result of `Math.log` to the nearest integer, which would cause the final result to be incorrect.

DONE.
