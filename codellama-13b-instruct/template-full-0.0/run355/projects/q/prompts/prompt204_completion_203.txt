  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This would cause the code to throw a ReferenceError if the variable is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with an empty argument list. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError if the function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a function call with an undefined argument. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError if the function is not defined.

DONE.
