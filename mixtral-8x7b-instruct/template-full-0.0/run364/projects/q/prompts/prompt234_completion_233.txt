 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new resolved promise instead of using the existing `resolvedPromise` object. This could cause issues if any dependent code expects the specific `resolvedPromise` instance to be used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `resolvedPromise` to `null`, which could cause errors in any dependent code that expects a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `resolvedPromise` to the `deferred` object, which is the parent object of the `promise` object. This could cause issues if any dependent code expects the `resolvedPromise` to be an instance of the `Promise` class.

DONE.
