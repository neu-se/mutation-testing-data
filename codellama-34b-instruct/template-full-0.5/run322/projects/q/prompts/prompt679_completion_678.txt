  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `call` method instead of the `apply` method, which would result in a different execution context for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `bind` method instead of the `apply` method, which would result in a different function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applyAll"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `applyAll` method instead of the `apply` method, which would result in the function being called with all the arguments passed to `dispatch` instead of just the first one.

DONE.
