  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `addRule` function is called with the `rules` array as the first argument, so using `push` would add the new rule to the end of the array instead of the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.splice(0, 0, [match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element to a specific index in an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. In this case, the `addRule` function is called with the `rules` array as the first argument, so using `splice` with an index of 0 would add the new rule to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
