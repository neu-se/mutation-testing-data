Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType && embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow matching embed types when `embedType` is truthy, leading to a situation where mismatched types do not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if `embedType` is null or undefined, potentially causing a runtime error if `embedType` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType && embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, preventing any error from being thrown even when the embed types do not match, thus masking potential issues in the data handling.

DONE.
