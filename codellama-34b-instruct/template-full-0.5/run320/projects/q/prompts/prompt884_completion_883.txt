  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that rejects the promise with the provided reason, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the provided arguments to the function and returns a promise for the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise for the result of the provided callback, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the provided arguments to the function and returns a promise for the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a promise for the result of the provided callback, whereas `fapply` is a method that applies the provided arguments to the function and returns a promise for the result.

DONE.
