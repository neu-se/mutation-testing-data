  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_shift` returns the first element of an array, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_pop` returns the last element of an array, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` can remove or replace elements in an array, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
