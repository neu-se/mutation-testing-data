  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'bug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'bug' would be appended to the original string, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would be converted to uppercase, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail if the JSON object contains any keys or values that are not uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would be reversed, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail if the JSON object contains any keys or values that are not in the correct order.

DONE.
