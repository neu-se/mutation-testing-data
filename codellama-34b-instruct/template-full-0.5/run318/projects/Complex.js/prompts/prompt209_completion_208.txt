  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the result of the `Math.atan2` function, which is used to calculate the argument of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `a` and `b` would change the result of the `Math.hypot` function, which is used to calculate the absolute value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `a` and `b` would change the result of the `Math.hypot` function, which is used to calculate the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
