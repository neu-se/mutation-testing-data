  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new deferred object, which means that `next.resolve` and `next.reject` would be different functions than `ends.resolve` and `ends.reject`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(ends.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new deferred object, but the `ends.promise` argument would cause the new deferred object to be resolved with the same value as `ends.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(ends.promise.then(function (value) {
  return value;
}));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new deferred object, and the `ends.promise.then()` method
