  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, while this replacement checks for strict equality. If `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not strictly equal, the replacement would return `false`, even if they are equal in a non-strict sense.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for inequality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, while this replacement checks for strict inequality. If `a[key]` and `b[key]` are not strictly unequal, the replacement would return `false`, even if they are unequal in a non-strict sense.
