  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only consider the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code would also consider the string "test".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href") + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only consider the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code would also consider the string "test".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only consider the value of the `href` attribute, while the modified code would also consider the first part of the URL.

DONE.
