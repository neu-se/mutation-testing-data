  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine. This means that the resulting complex number would have a different magnitude and phase, which could affect the accuracy of the computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of the argument, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine. This means that the resulting complex number would have a different magnitude and phase, which could affect the accuracy of the computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arc cosine of the argument, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine. This means that the resulting complex number would have a different magnitude and phase, which could affect the accuracy of the computation.

DONE.
