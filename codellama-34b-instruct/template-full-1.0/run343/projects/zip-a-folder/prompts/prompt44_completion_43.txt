  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a different method from `directory`, and would cause the code to treat the input as a single file instead of a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.dir
```
This would result in different behavior because `dir` is not a valid method in the `archiver` module, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive['directory']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method is called as a function instead of a method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
