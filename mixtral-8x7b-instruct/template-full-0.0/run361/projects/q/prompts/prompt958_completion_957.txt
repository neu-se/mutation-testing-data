 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line is not being called, so the callback will not receive the resolved value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.call(thisp, null, <some arbitrary value>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line is not being called, so the callback will not receive the resolved value or error. Additionally, a specific value is being passed to the callback, which is not how the original code behaves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(<some arbitrary value>).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line is not being called, so the callback will not receive the
