  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.call(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context in which the `field` function is called, potentially affecting how the function behaves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.bind(this, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `field` function to a different context at the time the function is called, potentially affecting how the function behaves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context in which the `field` function is called at the time the function is called, potentially affecting how the function behaves.

DONE.
