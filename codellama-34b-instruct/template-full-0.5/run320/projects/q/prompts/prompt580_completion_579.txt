  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a different `this` value, which would cause the `throw` verb to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a different `this` value, which would cause the `throw` verb to be called on the wrong object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw", null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a different `this` value, which would cause the `throw` verb to be called on the wrong object.

DONE.
