  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(null)
```
This code fragment will cause the `clone` method to be called with a `null` argument, which will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(undefined)
```
This code fragment will cause the `clone` method to be called with an `undefined` argument, which will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(false)
```
This code fragment will cause the `clone` method to be called with a `false` argument, which will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
