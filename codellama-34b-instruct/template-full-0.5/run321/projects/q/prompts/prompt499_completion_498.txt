  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a distinct primitive value from `null`, and the original code fragment checks for both `null` and `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion before comparing values, whereas `===` does not. This means that `name == null` will return `true` if `name` is either `null` or `undefined`, whereas `name === null` will only return `true` if `name` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` performs type coercion before comparing values, whereas `!==` does not. This means that `name != null` will return `false` if `name` is either `null` or `undefined`, whereas `name !== null` will only return `false` if `
