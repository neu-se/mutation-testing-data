  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise itself, instead of the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the resolved promise, instead of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random.nextInt()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random integer, instead of the value of the resolved promise.

DONE.
