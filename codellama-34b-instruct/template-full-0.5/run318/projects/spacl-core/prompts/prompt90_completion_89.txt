  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `policies` array in reverse order, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.reverse()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `policies` array in reverse order, but it would also modify the original array, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice().reverse()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `policies` array and then iterate over it in reverse order, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
