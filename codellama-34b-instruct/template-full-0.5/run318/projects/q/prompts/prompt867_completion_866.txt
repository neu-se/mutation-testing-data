  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with the value of the previous promise, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred promise with the error of the previous promise, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the deferred promise with the value of the previous promise, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
