 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(φ1) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, which can lead to different results due to floating point precision errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ) * Math.pow(Math.E, φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the exponential function instead of multiplying by the cosine of φ1, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ) / Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations and uses division instead of multiplication, which can lead to different results due to floating point precision errors.

DONE.
