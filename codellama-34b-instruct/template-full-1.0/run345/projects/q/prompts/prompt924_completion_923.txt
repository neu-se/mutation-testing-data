  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `nodeArgs` array to `Q.fapply`, instead of the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first element of the `nodeArgs` array to `Q.fapply`, instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to `Q.fapply`, instead of the `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
