  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` parameter as the base URL for parsing, while the replaced code always uses "http://example.com" as the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` parameter as the base URL for parsing, while the replaced code always uses "https://example.com" as the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sourceUrl` parameter as the base URL for parsing, while the replaced code always uses "http://example.com/path" as the base URL.

DONE.
