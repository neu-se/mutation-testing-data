  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `universalify.fromCallback` to convert a callback-based function to a promise-based function, while the buggy code fragment uses `universalify.fromPromise` to convert a promise-based function to a callback-based function. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the original code fragment is designed to work with callback-based functions, while the buggy code fragment is designed to work with promise-based functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `universalify.fromCallback` to convert a callback-based function to a promise-based function, while the buggy code fragment uses `fs.readFile` to read the file directly without converting it to a promise. This would cause the code to behave differently, as the original code fragment is designed to work with callback-based functions, while the buggy code fragment is
