Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would treat `null` as a non-promise value, causing it to skip the coercion step and directly call `fulfill(null)`, which may not be the intended behavior if `null` is not a valid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would also be treated as a non-promise value, leading to a direct call to `fulfill(undefined)`, which could result in unexpected behavior if the caller expects a promise to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is not a promise or a thenable, and it would cause the function to call `fulfill("string")`, which may not be the expected outcome if the input is supposed to be a promise or an object.

DONE.
