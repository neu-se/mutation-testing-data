 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module.exports === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of `module.exports` instead of `exports`. This could cause issues if the developer was using the `module.exports` syntax instead of the `exports` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `exports` object is not defined, which would be true in a CommonJS environment but not in other environments such as the browser. This could cause the code to break in non-CommonJS environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always evaluates to true, regardless of the environment. This could cause unintended side effects if the code was expecting the condition to be false in certain situations.

DONE.
