  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var global = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `global` variable is used to determine the environment in which the script is running, and setting it to `null` would cause the script to fail to function properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var global = "undefined";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `global` variable is used to determine the environment in which the script is running, and setting it to a string value of `"undefined"` would cause the script to fail to function properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var global = function () { return this; }();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `global` variable is used to determine the environment in which the script is running, and setting it to a function that returns the global object would cause the script to fail to function properly.

DONE.
