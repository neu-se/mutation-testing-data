  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `index` variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code would access the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `index` variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code would access the previous element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `index` variable to access the current element in the array, while the modified code would access the element at twice the index.

DONE.
