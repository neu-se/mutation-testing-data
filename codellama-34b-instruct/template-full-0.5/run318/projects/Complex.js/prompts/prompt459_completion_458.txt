  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] < Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is less than infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['im'] < Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is less than infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] > -Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while this new code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is greater than negative infinity.

DONE.
