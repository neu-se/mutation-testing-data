  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
