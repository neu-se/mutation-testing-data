  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while this new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using each character as a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(' ', 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while this new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using a space character as the separator and returns at most 2 elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator, while this new code fragment splits the buffer into an array of strings using null as the separator.

DONE.
