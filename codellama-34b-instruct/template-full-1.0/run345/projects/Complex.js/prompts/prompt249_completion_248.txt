  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contained `a`, which refers to the instance of the Complex class, while `b` could potentially refer to a different variable or object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contained `a`, which is presumably a complex number, and `1` is a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contained `a`, which refers to the instance of the Complex class, while `z` could potentially refer to a different complex number.

DONE.
