  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the second string in the strings array instead of the first string, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the length of the first string in the strings array instead of the first string itself, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the uppercase version of the first string in the strings array instead of the original string, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
