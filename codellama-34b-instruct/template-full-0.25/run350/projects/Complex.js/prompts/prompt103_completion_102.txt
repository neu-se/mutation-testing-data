  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if there are fewer plus signs than minus signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs and ignores the number of minus signs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus > plus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if there are more minus signs than plus signs.

DONE.
