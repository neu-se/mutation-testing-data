  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the sign of the imaginary part of the input complex number, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the real part of the input complex number, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the real part of the output complex number to zero, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
