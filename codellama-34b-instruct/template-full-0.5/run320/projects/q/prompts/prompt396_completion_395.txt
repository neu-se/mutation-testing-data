  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null instead of the value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with null instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined instead of the value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with undefined instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Test error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of returning a value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the error instead of being resolved with the expected value.

DONE.
