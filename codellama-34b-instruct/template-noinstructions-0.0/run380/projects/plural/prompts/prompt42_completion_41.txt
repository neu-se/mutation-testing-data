  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means that the substring starting from the beginning of the word and ending at the second-to-last character would be returned. Replacing it with `1` would result in the substring starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character being returned, which would be different for words that have a length of 2 or more.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `0`, which means that the substring starting from the beginning of the word and ending at the second-to-last character would be returned. Replacing it with `-1` would result in the substring starting from the second-to-last character and ending at the beginning of the word being returned, which would be different for words that have a length of 2 or more.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length -
