 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the newOp to the last index of the ops array instead of pushing it to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the newOp at the last index of the ops array, even if the index is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(index, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp at the specified index or at the end of the array if the index is out of bounds. However, this is not the intended behavior of the original code, which is to insert the newOp at the specified index if it is within bounds, or at the end of the array if the index is out of bounds.

DONE.
