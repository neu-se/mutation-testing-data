 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = this.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the array in reverse order, which may not be the intended behavior in the code that uses this `array_indexOf` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i += 1; i in this; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the incremented index is a property of the array, rather than checking if the original index is a property of the array. This may cause it to skip over some elements or include non-integer properties in the search.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'i' < this.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a string comparison instead of a numeric comparison, which will always be false since the length of an array is a number. This would cause the loop to never execute, and the function
