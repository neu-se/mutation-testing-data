  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Different behavior");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise, while this new code fragment would reject the promise with a new error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Different behavior");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise, while this new code fragment would reject the promise with a new rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Different behavior");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the original value, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise with a new value.

DONE.
