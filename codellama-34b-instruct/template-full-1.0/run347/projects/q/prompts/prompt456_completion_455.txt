  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_indexOf` returns the first index at which a given element can be found in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` returns the reversed order of an array, while `array_indexOf` returns the first index at which a given element can be found in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_indexOf` returns the first index at which a given element can be found in an array.

DONE.
