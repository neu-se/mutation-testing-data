  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` operator would concatenate the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` instead of comparing them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] - b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `-` operator would subtract the value of `b[key]` from `a[key]` instead of comparing them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] * b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `*` operator would multiply the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` instead of comparing them.

DONE.
