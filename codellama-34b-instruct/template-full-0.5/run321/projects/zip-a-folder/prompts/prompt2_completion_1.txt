  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress(src, targetFilePath, format, zipAFolderOptions, { gzip: true, gzipOptions: { level: 9 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzipOptions` object is not passed to the `compress` method, which would result in the default compression level being used instead of the specified level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress(src, targetFilePath, format, zipAFolderOptions, { gzip: false, gzipOptions: { level: 9 } });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is set to `false`, which would result in the file being compressed without gzip compression, regardless of the specified compression level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress(src, targetFilePath, format, zipAFolderOptions, { gzip: true, gzipOptions:
