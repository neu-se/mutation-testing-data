  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length of the string by 3 instead of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the length of the string by 4 instead of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reduce the length of the string at all.

DONE.
