  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a number. In the original code, `process` is not an object, so the condition evaluates to false. In the replacement, `process` is a number, so the condition evaluates to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. In the original code, `process` is an object, so the condition evaluates to true. In the replacement, `process` is not an object, so the condition evaluates to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() !== "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process.toString()` is a specific string,
