  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ key: val }
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` is not a variable defined in the function, and it will not return the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is not an object, and it will not have the `key` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + val
```
This would result in different behavior because `key` and `val` are not used together in the same way as in the original code, and it will not produce the expected value.

DONE.
