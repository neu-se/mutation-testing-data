  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, while the modified code fragment would have thrown the exception directly, causing the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, while the modified code fragment would have returned a resolved promise with the exception as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, while the modified code fragment would have returned a rejected promise with a new error as the reason.

DONE.
