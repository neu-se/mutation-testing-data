  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not throw an error, so the promise would have been resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not return a rejected promise, so the promise would have been resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve("Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not return a resolved promise, so the promise would have been rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
