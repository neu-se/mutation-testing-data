  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the code would access a different element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the code would access a different element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, and the code would access a different element.

DONE.
