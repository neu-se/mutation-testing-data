  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the first `<base>` element in the document, rather than the `href` attribute of the `base` element in the `head` section.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('head base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the first `<base>` element in the `head` section of the document, rather than the `href` attribute of the `base` element in the `head` section.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('head base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the first `<base>` element in the `head` section of the document, rather than the `href` attribute of the `base` element in the `head` section.

DONE.
