  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is a number, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is a string, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is undefined, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
