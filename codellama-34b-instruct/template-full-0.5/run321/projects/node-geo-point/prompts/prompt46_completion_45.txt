  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse function of `deg2rad`, meaning that it converts radians to degrees, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians. Using `rad2deg` in the `calculateBearing` function would cause the calculation to be performed in the opposite direction, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ2)` is the sine of the latitude in radians, whereas `deg2rad(φ2)` is the latitude in degrees. Using `sin(φ2)` in the `calculateBearing` function would cause the calculation to be performed using the sine of the latitude, which would result in a different bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ2)`
