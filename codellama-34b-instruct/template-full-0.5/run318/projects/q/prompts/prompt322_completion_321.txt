  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first argument to the `descriptor[op]` method, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args[0]].concat(args.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument as a separate element in an array, followed by all but the first argument, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

DONE.
