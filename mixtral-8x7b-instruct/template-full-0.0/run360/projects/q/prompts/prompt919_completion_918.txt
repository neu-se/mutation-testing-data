 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push` call would add an empty object instead of a node resolver function, causing the callback to never be called and the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push` call would add a `resolve` function instead of a node resolver function, causing the promise to immediately resolve with `undefined` instead of waiting for the Node.js callback to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
