 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the keys of object 'a' instead of 'b' in the `diff` function, potentially missing mismatched values between the two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(c))
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new variable 'c' that is not defined or passed as an argument in the `diff` function, causing an error or unintended results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).reduce<AttributeMap>((attrs, key) => {
  if (!isEqual(a[key], b[key])) {
    attrs[key] = b[key] || null;
  }
  return attrs;
}, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the '||' operator instead of the conditional operator '? :
