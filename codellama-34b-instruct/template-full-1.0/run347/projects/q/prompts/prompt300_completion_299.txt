  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`defer`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `deferred.promise` field accessible, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`array_slice(arguments, 1)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the remainder of the arguments, which is not the intended behavior for `Q().join`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`object`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the object itself, rather than a promise for it.

DONE.
