  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the argument is not an array. This change would cause the function to return a different value for arrays and non-arrays, which could potentially break the code that uses this function.

DONE.
