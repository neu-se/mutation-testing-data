  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data, name` expects an object and a string, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data, name` expects an object and a string, while `123` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'myCoolObject'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data, name` expects an object and a string, while `myCoolObject` is a string.

DONE.
