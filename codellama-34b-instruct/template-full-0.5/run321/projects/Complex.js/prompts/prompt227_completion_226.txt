  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while this replacement adds 1 to the value of `a`, which could potentially change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while this replacement multiplies `a` by 2, which could potentially change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `a` directly, while this replacement subtracts 1 from the value of `a`, which could potentially change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
