 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` always returns a resolved promise, while the original `Q.async` returns a function that decorates a generator function to handle promises yielded within the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number, while the original `Q.async` returns a function that decorates a generator function to handle promises yielded within the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not a function, while the original `Q.async` is a function that decorates a generator function to handle promises yielded within the generator.

DONE.
