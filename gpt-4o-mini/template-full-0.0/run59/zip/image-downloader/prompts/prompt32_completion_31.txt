Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly reject the request when the status code is 200, which indicates a successful response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode > 200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the request for any status code greater than 200, which may include valid responses like 201 (Created) or 204 (No Content).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 400
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the request for any status code less than 400, which would incorrectly treat successful responses (like 200) as failures.

DONE.
