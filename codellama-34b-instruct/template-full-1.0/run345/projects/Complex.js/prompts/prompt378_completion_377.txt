  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the variable `b` instead of `a`, which could lead to a different value being returned by the `Complex` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could lead to a different value being returned by the `Complex` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by `b`, which could lead to a different value being returned by the `Complex` constructor.

DONE.
