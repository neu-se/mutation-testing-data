Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
middleware.applyBeforeValidation === beforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional check to skip the middleware when `applyBeforeValidation` matches `beforeValidation`, instead of skipping when they don't match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!middleware.applyBeforeValidation
```
This would result in different behavior because it always skips the middleware when `applyBeforeValidation` is false, regardless of the value of `beforeValidation`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof middleware.applyBeforeValidation === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the middleware when `applyBeforeValidation` is undefined, which could happen if the middleware was not properly initialized, instead of checking its value against `beforeValidation`.

DONE.
