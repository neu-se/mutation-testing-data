  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 strings[0] + strings[1] + cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different length than the original string, which is used to determine the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 strings[0] * strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different length than the original string, and the multiplication would result in the string being repeated a different number of times than the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 strings[0].concat(strings[1]) + cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different length than the original string, and the concatenation would result in the two strings being joined together in a different order than the original string.

DONE.
