  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which means that the expression `!keepNull` would be true if `keepNull` is false, and false if `keepNull` is true. In contrast, `keepNull` by itself is a boolean value that is true if `keepNull` is true, and false if `keepNull` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which means that the expression `!keepNull || true` would be true if either `!keepNull` or `true` is true. In contrast, `!keepNull` by itself is a boolean value that is true if `keepNull` is false, and false if `keepNull` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the
