  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `field` by 1, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `unique` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator multiplies the value of `field` by 2, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `unique` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts the value of `field` to lowercase, which may not be the desired behavior in the context of the `unique` function.

DONE.
