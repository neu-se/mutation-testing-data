  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q(value)` returns a promise that resolves to `value`, while the replacement code fragment `1 + value` returns a promise that resolves to `1 + value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q(value)` returns a promise that resolves to `value`, while the replacement code fragment `value + 1` returns a promise that resolves to `value + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q(value)` returns a promise that resolves to `value`, while the replacement code fragment `Promise.resolve(value)` returns a promise that resolves to `value`, but the latter would also not trigger any progress events if `value` is a promise object.
