  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one additional time, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never iterate, potentially leading to an unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one additional time, potentially leading to an index out of bounds error.

DONE.
