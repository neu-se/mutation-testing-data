  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is not a string. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `options` is a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is `null`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `options` is not a string, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is a string, while this replacement checks if it is an empty string. This would
