  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the `rest()` method with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = offset + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the offset by one, which would cause the method to return a different set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = this.index + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the offset to one more than the current index, which would cause the method to return a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset = Math.floor(this.index / 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the offset to half the current index, which would cause the method to return a different set of operations.

DONE.
