  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` are different variables, and using `point2Rad` instead of `point1Rad` would cause the calculation to use the wrong latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad + point2Rad` would cause the calculation to use the sum of the two latitude values, which would result in a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and using it instead of `point1Rad` or `point2Rad` would cause the calculation to use a different value, resulting in a different distance calculation.

DONE.
