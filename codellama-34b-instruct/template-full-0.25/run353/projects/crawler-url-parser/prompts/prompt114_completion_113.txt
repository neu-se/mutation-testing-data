  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values. This would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the keys of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values, which are the URLs and their associated data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the `urlMap` object. This would cause the `for` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values, which are the URLs and their associated data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the values in
