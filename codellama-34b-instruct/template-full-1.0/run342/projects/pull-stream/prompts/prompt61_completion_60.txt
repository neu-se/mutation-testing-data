  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end = end || true) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `===` for comparison, but this replacement uses `=`, which would assign a value to `end` instead of comparing it. This change could cause the code to behave differently, especially if the value of `end` is not what is expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(end == 'true') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `===` for comparison, but this replacement uses `==`, which would compare `end` to the string `'true'` instead of doing a strict equality check. This change could cause the code to behave differently, especially if the value of `end` is not what is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(abort = true) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `===` for comparison, but this replacement uses `=`,
