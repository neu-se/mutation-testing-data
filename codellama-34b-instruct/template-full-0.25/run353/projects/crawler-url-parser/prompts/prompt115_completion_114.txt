  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` returns an iterable of the keys in the map, whereas `values` returns an iterable of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` returns an iterable of the key-value pairs in the map, whereas `values` returns an iterable of the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` returns the number of key-value pairs in the map, whereas `values` returns an iterable of the values.

DONE.
