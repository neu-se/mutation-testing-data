  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would never be entered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be entered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.valueOf() === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would never be entered.

DONE.
