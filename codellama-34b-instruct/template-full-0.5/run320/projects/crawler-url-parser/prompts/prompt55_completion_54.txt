  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the query string in the parsed URL, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the fragment in the parsed URL, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the query string or fragment in the parsed URL, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
