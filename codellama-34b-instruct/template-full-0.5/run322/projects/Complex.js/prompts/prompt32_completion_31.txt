  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `a` is equal to 0, but this new code is assigning the value 1 to `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `a` is equal to 0, but this new code is checking if `a` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `a` is equal to 0, but this new code is checking if `a` is equal to `b`.

DONE.
