  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms * 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would be called with double the intended time, leading to a test failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms / 2, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would be called with half the intended time, leading to a test failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, error + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be modified, leading to a test failure.

DONE.
