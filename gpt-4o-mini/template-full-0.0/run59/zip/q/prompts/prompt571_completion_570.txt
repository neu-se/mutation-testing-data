Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function with a specified `this` value and arguments, which may lead to different context handling compared to `apply`, which passes an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, but does not execute the generator immediately, unlike `apply`, which executes the function right away.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling the function directly without any arguments would not pass the generator's context or arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors when the generator tries to access its expected parameters.

DONE.
