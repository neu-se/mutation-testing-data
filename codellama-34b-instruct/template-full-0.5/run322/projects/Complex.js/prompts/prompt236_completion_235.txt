  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting value would be different from the original code fragment, which would affect the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting value would be different from the original code fragment, which would affect the calculation of the complex square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting value would be different from the original code fragment, which would affect the calculation of the complex square root.

DONE.
