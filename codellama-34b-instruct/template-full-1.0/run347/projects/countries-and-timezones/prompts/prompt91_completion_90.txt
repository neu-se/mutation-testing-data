  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(country.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `country` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry( country[id] )
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `country[id]` would be undefined since `country` does not have an `id` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(country.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.name` is undefined since `country` does not have a `name` property.

DONE.
