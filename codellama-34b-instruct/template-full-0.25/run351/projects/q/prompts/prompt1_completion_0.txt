  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is not a function, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is undefined, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is an object, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `bootstrap` is a function.

DONE.
