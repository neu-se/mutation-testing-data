  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `field`, which could cause the `seen` object to be indexed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `field`, which could cause the `seen` object to be indexed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of `field` to a string, which could cause the `seen` object to be indexed incorrectly.

DONE.
