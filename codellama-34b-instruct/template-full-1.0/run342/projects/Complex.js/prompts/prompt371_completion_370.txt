  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different return values for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the result of `Math.sin` would give a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` have different return values for the same input.

DONE.
