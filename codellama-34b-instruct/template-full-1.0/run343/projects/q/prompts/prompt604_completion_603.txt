  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with itself, instead of resolving it with the result of the dispatch method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred promise with itself, instead of rejecting it with the result of the dispatch method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(deferred.promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the deferred promise with itself, instead of notifying it with the result of the dispatch method.

DONE.
