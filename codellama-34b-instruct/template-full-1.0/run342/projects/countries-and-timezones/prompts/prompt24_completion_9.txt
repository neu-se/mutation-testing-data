  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 30
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` property is assumed to be an integer, but adding 30 would result in a floating-point number. This could cause the `getOffsetStr` function to produce an incorrect output string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is an irrational number, and multiplying it by `utcOffset` would result in a non-integer value, which could cause the `getOffsetStr` function to produce an incorrect output string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is an invalid value for the `utcOffset` property, and passing it to the `getOffsetStr` function would cause it to produce an incorrect output string.

DONE.
