  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the value of the `value` variable, while the new code fragment `null` would return the null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the value of the `value` variable, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return the undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would return the value of the `value` variable, while the new code fragment `0` would return the number 0.

DONE.
