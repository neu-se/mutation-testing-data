  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code.

DONE.
