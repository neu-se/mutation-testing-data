  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This code fragment checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is less than 2, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This code fragment checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is greater than 2, which is also the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the length of the `coordinates` array is equal to 0, which is a different condition than the original code fragment.

DONE.
