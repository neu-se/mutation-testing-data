  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` can be `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that does not compare equal to anything, including itself. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to any string. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `tz.r` is not `undefined`.

DONE.
