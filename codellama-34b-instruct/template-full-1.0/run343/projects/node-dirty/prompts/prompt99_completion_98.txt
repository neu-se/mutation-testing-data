  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`, { code: 500 });
```
This would result in different behavior because `500` is a new property being added to the `Error` object, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(`Ignoring corrupted row: ${rowStr}`);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would suppress any error handling that may occur when a corrupted row is encountered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('\n');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method assumes that the input is a string and would error out if it receives an object or array, which may cause an unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
