  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point. Using `sinφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the latitude of the first point, rather than the latitude of the second point, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the latitude of the first point, while `sinφ2` is the sine of the latitude of the second point. Using `cosφ1` instead of `sinφ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be based on the cosine of the latitude of the first point, rather than the sine of the latitude of the second point, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
