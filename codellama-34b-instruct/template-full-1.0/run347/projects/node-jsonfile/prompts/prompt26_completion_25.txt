  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a reviver function as an option, but a null value would cause the JSON.parse() function to throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a reviver function as an option, but an empty object would cause the JSON.parse() function to return undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a reviver function as an option, but the console.log function would cause the JSON.parse() function to return undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
