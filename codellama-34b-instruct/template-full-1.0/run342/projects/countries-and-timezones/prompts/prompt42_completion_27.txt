  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call is missing the `id` parameter, which would cause the code to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call is using a different method signature, which would cause the code to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call is missing the `options` parameter, which could cause the code to return a different result.

DONE.
