  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the modifications to be retained instead of deleted, which would lead to an incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the modifications to be deleted instead of retained, which would lead to an incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.compose(delta);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the modifications to be composed with an empty delta, which would have no effect on the output.

DONE.
