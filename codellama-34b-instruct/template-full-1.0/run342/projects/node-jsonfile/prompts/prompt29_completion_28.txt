  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a built-in JavaScript method that serializes an object or value to a JSON string, whereas the original implementation uses a custom `stringify` function that may have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` flag at the end of the `stringify` call would enable additional validation and error handling that may not be present in the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(stripBom(data), options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is a function that removes the byte-order mark (BOM) from the beginning of a string, which may not be necessary or desirable in all cases.

DONE.
