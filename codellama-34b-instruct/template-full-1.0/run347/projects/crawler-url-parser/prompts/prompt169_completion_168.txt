  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace("/", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the `linkurl_path` string, potentially changing the result of the `includes` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the `linkurl_path` string, potentially changing the result of the `includes` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first occurrence of `pageurl_path` in `linkurl_path`, potentially changing the result of the `includes` method.

DONE.
