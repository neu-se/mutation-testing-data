  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the third operand instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && !operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the second operand is falsy instead of truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op !== "when" || operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the operator is not "when" or if the second operand is truthy, instead of checking if the operator is "when" and the second operand is truthy.

DONE.
