Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback `cb` if it is truthy, which means if `cb` is `undefined` or `null`, it will not execute any function, potentially leading to unhandled cases where the callback is expected to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Abort called') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it will throw a new error when the `abort` function is called, instead of executing a no-op function, which could disrupt the flow of the program and lead to unhandled exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { console.log('Abort executed') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it will log a message to the console instead of doing nothing, which could lead to side effects in the application, such as cluttering the console output or affecting performance if called frequently.

DONE.
